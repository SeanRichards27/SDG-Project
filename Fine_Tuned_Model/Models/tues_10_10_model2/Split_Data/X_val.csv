"ICT-Mediated and Digital Technologies for Peace and Sustainability in Cities The focus of the research programme is on enabling digital technologies for achieving the SDGs and governance 
of sustainability transition. This will be focused on the NERPS’ central theme of peace and sustainability, as well 
as transdisciplinary methods to the enhancement of institutional structures. This project plan will be further 
developed with the team to ensure if fits the needs and perspectives of the research pathways at Hiroshima 
University.

The aim of the study is to explore and evaluate ICT-based methods and medium (Including ICT platforms, digital 
technologies and mechanisms) focused on health sector and health initiatives at the city and community levels. 
For the health sector, we look into ICT-mediated methods that address resilience of cities and communities, by 
addressing two of the positive peace dimensions, namely “a well-functioning government” and “equitable 
distribution of resources”. For the health initiatives, we look into specific smart healthcare and smart health 
services, by addressing two other positive peace dimensions, namely “free flow of information” and “good 
relations with neighbours”. We then evaluate how ICT-mediated approaches could help to meet the four 
dimensions of sustainability, defined as the core principles of sustainable development. These dimensions 
include social, economic, environmental, and institutional. "
"Towards ecological bushfire management models  ""We propose a multidisciplinary workshop gathering scientists and stakeholders from various domains: ecology, social science, technology, Earth observation science, data science, computer science and mathematics, so as to identify new opportunities and research avenues for bushfire management and, more generally, for land management. 

Real case optimisation modelling can be roughly defined as the combination of a CONTEXT, related DATA, MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSES and NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION.  Here, we will focus on the three first components. The implementation and computational tests will be addressed later for specific identified problems.  Following this logic, the workshop is organised in three days: 
1. Ecological wager of fire and alternative practices including notably the impact of fires on emblematic species and the question of traditional Aboriginal fires 
2. Data science for ecological data that merges data mining, geospatial sciences and space technologies.
3. Ecological and ecosystem perspective in model-based bushfire management: a capstone on how to embed the conclusions of the two first days into mathematical optimisation models for fire land management.

The workshop is scheduled from 12 to 14 November 2018 in room 80.04.20 and 80.04.21.  It includes a public lecture (by Cristina Montiel Molina Professor of Regional Geography, University Complutensa of Madrid / Pau Costa Foundation,  Spain) during the evening of 12 November in  80.07.01 (topic to be announced). We expect 40 participants for the workshop and 80 for the public lecture.

It will be the opportunity to engage, internally, with the Sir Lawrence Wackett Centre and aerospace engineering and externally, with visitors from local and international universities.

"Enabling repair and regeneration after neonatal stroke. Neurodevelopmental disorders program ? focus on a regenerative therapy for neonatal stroke More than 1 in 4000 children suffer a stroke soon after birth. Neonatal stroke is challenging to identify clinically, meaning there is often a long delay to diagnosis, and cerebral palsy (CP)-like outcomes are not uncommon. In a model of neonatal stroke well suited to screen therapies, we will use a novel hydrogel specifically engineered to release molecules and growth factors in a controlled, time-dependent fashion that supports brain regeneration, to test if established neonatal brain injury can be repaired. This biocompatible hydrogel has proven regenerative effects in adult pre-clinical models of focal brain injury. Here, we will establish the combination of treatment molecules that maximises repair and regeneration of the damaged neonatal brain after stroke. There are currently no effective treatments for neonatal stroke, and our hydrogel approach has clear potential to translate to use in the clinic to address this urgent need.
Project Aims:
We will test a novel molecular hydrogel therapy to promote repair of the damaged neonatal brain. We have developed a bioengineered peptide hydrogel `functionalised? by the addition of fucoidan - a powerful anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory polysaccharide seaweed extract ? which is capable of the release of molecules and growth factors in a time-dependent manner to antagonise the well-characterised sequence of cellular changes that lead to neuronal and white matter damage. We have developed a neonatal rat model of focal ischaemic stroke using non-invasive photoembolism, which is ideal for testing this hydrogel therapy as it produces a clearly defined and highly reproducible ischaemic infarct."

"Taking a gamble for high rewards? Management perspectives on the value of mental health peer workers Mental Health Recovery; Peer Group; Mental Disease Mental health peer work is attracting growing interest and provides a potentially impactful method of service user involvement in mental health design and delivery, contributing to mental health reform. The need to effectively support this emerging workforce is consequently increasing. This study aimed to better understand the views of management in relation to peer work and specifically explores the value of peer work from the perspective of management. This qualitative research employed grounded theory methods. There were 29 participants in total, employed in both peer designated and non-peer designated management roles, in not for profit and public health organisations in Queensland, Australia. The value of peer work as described by participants is found to be partially dependent on practical supports and strategies from the organisation. There were high benefits for all facets of the organisation when effective recruitment and ongoing support for peer workers was prioritised and a higher perception of limitations when they were not. Due to some parallels, it may be useful to explore the potential for peer work to be conceptually and/or practically considered as a form of diversity and inclusion employment."
"Phillip Island Nature Parks Research Project Evaluating interactions of beachgoers and their dogs with local wildlife Phillip Island Nature Parks (PINP) are currently pursuing a number of interventions and awareness campaigns aimed at reducing conflicts and harmful interactions between off-leash dogs and local wildlife on PINP-managed beaches.

"Impacts of Collaborative Partnership on the Performance of Cold Supply Chains of Agriculture and Foods: Literature Review Sales; Options Contract; Supply Chain Coordination Collaboration in a supply chain continuously proves its role in increasing the performance of supply chains, which attracts the attention of both academia and practitioners, specifically, how to generate higher impacts of collaborative partnership on the performance of supply chains and measure them. In cold supply chains of agriculture and foods, the vital need for collaboration becomes even more significant to improve the performance. Therefore, this paper reviews relevant articles derived from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Via the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), the research team classifies the types of collaborative partnership in cold agriculture and food supply chains, issues of the literature when analyzing collaboration impacts on the performance of CSCs of agriculture and foods, and finally, the opportunities for the future research to boost the collaboration practices in these cold chains. Following this sequence, 102 articles were eventually extracted for the systematic review to identify themes for not only addressing the review questions but also highlighting future research opportunities for both development of partnership integration and performance of the cold chains of agriculture and foods."
Defining a viral reservoir in the central nervous system of HIV-infected individuals on ART (Administered by University of Melbourne) HIV cannot be eradicated by antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone. Understanding how HIV persists within the tissues of the central nervous system is paramount to HIV cure. This study will define the reservoirs of HIV existing in the brain tissue of virally suppressed individuals.
"Comparative toxicity of synchrotron and conventional radiation therapy based on total and partial body irradiation in a murine model Dosimetry; Hypofractionated Radiotherapy; Synchrotron Radiation Synchrotron radiation can facilitate novel radiation therapy modalities such as microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) and high dose-rate synchrotron broad-beam radiation therapy (SBBR). Both of these modalities have unique physical properties that could be exploited for an improved therapeutic effect. While pre-clinical studies report promising normal tissue sparing phenomena, systematic toxicity data are still required. Our objective was to characterise the toxicity of SBBR and MRT and to calculate equivalent doses of conventional radiation therapy (CRT). A dose-escalation study was performed on C57BLJ/6 mice using total body and partial body irradiations. Dose-response curves and TD50 values were subsequently calculated using PROBIT analysis. For SBBR at dose-rates of 37 to 41 Gy/s, we found no evidence of a normal tissue sparing effect relative to CRT. Our findings also show that the MRT valley dose, rather than the peak dose, best correlates with CRT doses for acute toxicity. Importantly, longer-term weight tracking of irradiated animals revealed more pronounced growth impairment following MRT compared to both SBBR and CRT. Overall, this study provides the first in vivo dose-equivalence data between MRT, SBBR and CRT and presents systematic toxicity data for a range of organs that can be used as a reference point for future pre-clinical work."

"Synthesis of bio-functional nanoparticles from sono-responsive amino acids using high frequency ultrasound Crystallization; Melting; Supercooling A simple, one-pot high frequency ultrasonication (490 kHz) methodology to convert hydrophobic and amphipathic amino acids into nanostructures was investigated. The approach involved the oxidative coupling of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and tryptophan) in aqueous solutions to form high molecular weight dimers and oligomers. The role of cavitation bubble surface and ultrasonic power to trigger the out-of-equilibrium self-assembly of dimers and trimers to spherical and uniform nanostructures with controlled size has been discussed. The synthesized particles exhibited fluorescence in blue, green and red spectral regions and a strong antioxidant activity."
"Envelope glycoprotein determinants of HIV-1 subtype C tropism and pathogenicity Nearly all HIV studies have been conducted on subtype B HIV. However, the overwhelming majority of individuals with HIV are infected with subtype C virus (C-HIV), and reside in Southern Africa and Central Asia. Despite this we know very little about C-HIV, although we do know that its pathogenesis is distinct from other HIV subtypes and likely involves unique genetic, structural and functional alterations in the viral envelope glycoproteins (Env). Our study will elucidate the Env-receptor interactions that evolve over time in subjects infected with C-HIV that dictate tropism alterations for macrophages and CD4+ T-cell subsets. We will show that these interactions are unique to C-HIV and important for C-HIV disease progression."

"Unlocking the potential of magnetic 2D materials with quantum microscopy This project aims to create a universal, high-throughput platform to characterise magnetic 2D materials, by
exploiting recently developed quantum diamond microscopy. It will enable the measurement of hitherto
inaccessible magnetic properties of individual 2D microsheets, the imaging of device-relevant phenomena such as
domain wall dynamics and skyrmionics, and the systematic screening of newly synthesised materials. Anticipated
outcomes include crucial new insights into 2D magnetism and the discovery of magnetic 2D materials compatible
with real-world conditions. This should accelerate the development of future energy-efficient and flexible
electronics and memory technologies, where magnetic 2D materials are expected to play a key role."
"Researching and Codesigning the Early Childhood Early Intervention (ECEI) Support There are various challenges currently being experienced by families and practitioners in the implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme’s (NDIS), Early Childhood Early Intervention (ECEI) program for young children with a developmental delay or disability, and their families. In particular, two areas of potential improvement in the ECEI service delivery have been identified as essential if to improve the experiences and overcome the challenges. The following key questions have been identified:
1. How are the assessment of support needs and goal-setting procedures with families currently conducted?
2. How might we co-imagine better ways to provide these services at Brotherhood of St. Laurence?
To address these issues, the Brotherhood of St Laurence (The Organisation) has commenced a participatory design research project (Co-designing ECEI project) and invited RMIT’s, Dr. Jaz Hee-jeong Choi, to be a partner in conducting this research and investigation to ascertain what is required.
The Research Services to be undertaken in completion of this agreement are part of a larger project. The purpose of the larger project is to address the challenges faced by families and practitioners working in the NDIS ECEI service."

"The effects of blackcurrant and strawberry powder on the physicochemical and in vitro glycaemic response of starches derived from sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and potato (Solanum tuberosum) Retrogradation; Rice Starch; Digestion Phenolic compounds have been shown to deliver numerous health benefits. Research has also shown that starch and phenolic compounds interact. This study aimed to investigate the effects of blackcurrant and strawberry powder on the physicochemical and in vitro predicted glycaemic response of sweet potato and potato starches. Sweet potato, or potato, starches were mixed with 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% (w/w) of blackcurrant, or strawberry, powder, to form blackcurrant and strawberry-enriched starch pastes. The results showed that enrichment with 5%, 10% and 15% blackcurrant or strawberry powder for sweet potato and potato starch significantly altered the pasting viscosity and colour profiles (P < 0.05), increased the phenolic content and antioxidant activities of starch pastes (P < 0.05). Blackcurrant or strawberry powders mixed with sweet potato or potato starches reduced amount of reducing sugar released during in vitro digestion. Addition of 15% blackcurrant powder for the starch exerted stronger in vitro antioxidant and hypoglycaemic properties than that of 15% strawberry powder. Collectively, these findings suggested that addition of blackcurrant or strawberry powder into sweet potato and potato starches manipulated the hypoglycaemic property of pastes."

"Amplification-free electrochemiluminescence molecular beacon-based microRNA sensing using a mobile phone for detection Hybridization Chain Reaction; DNA; Hairpins microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important biomarkers for numerous diseases, but their widespread use has been hampered by the lack of point-of-care testing solutions. Herein, we demonstrate a sensitive, rapid and portable electrochemiluminescence (ECL) based sensor for miRNA-21 combining a switch-on ECL molecular beacon with magnetic bead based extraction of the miRNA target sequence. Streptavidin coated magnetic beads were functionalised with a hairpin molecular beacon; one stem of the beacon was functionalised with an ECL active label and the opposing stem was functionalised with a quencher. When the target miRNA was present, the hairpin opened, separating the label and quencher, generating an intense ECL signal. The sensor provides a simple and robust strategy for miRNA detection without the need for intercalating labels, reporter probes for detection, added enzymes or hairpin primers for target amplification. The detection limit of the sensor is 500 attomoles of miRNA-21 when using a photomultiplier tube for ECL detection. The potential of the developed sensor for point-of-care applications has been demonstrated by combining the molecular beacon ECL sensor with a portable potentiostat for ECL generation and a mobile phone camera for ECL detection of miRNA-21."
"Defining HIV reservoirs in the central nervous system In this study a comprehensive quantitative and phenotypic analysis of HIV-infected cell populations in distinct CNS
and non-CNS tissues obtained from chronically HIV-infected individuals will be performed in order to determine HIV
persistence in the CNS and inform HIV cure strategies. To this end we have compiled one of the largest tissue
banks of matched CNS and non-CNS tissue from HIV-infected individuals in Australia (n=80). Tissue from CNS and
non-CNS regions will be assessed by immunohistochemistry/hybridisation methods for cells containing viral DNA
and/or RNA using highly novel and sophisticated DNA/RNAscope platforms. These methods offer significant
benefits over traditional qPCR based quantification methods as they provide information at a single cell level, thus
allowing for the specific cell types infected in the CNS to be assessed. Furthermore, they can be performed on
formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue.
Secondly, we will further characterise the potential replicative ability of HIV infected cells in the CNS by assessing
intact genomes as it has been reported that ~93% of proviruses in CD4+ T cell reservoirs, a major HIV reservoir in
the blood, are defective and contain large internal deletions/and or hypermutations at the HIV tat-rev splice junction
(Bruner Nat Med 2016). Thus, cells expressing HIV DNA/RNA will be further assessed using a unique newly
developed hybridisation technique BASEscope that identifies intact, and therefore potentially replication competent,
HIV RNA."

"Drag Reduction of a Passenger Car Using Flow Control Techniques Aerodynamic Drag; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Wind Tunnels The paper describes flow control techniques viz. vane-type vortex generator (VG) array and rear-spoiler on its trunk (boot) side used to reduce drag of a passenger car. The experimental and computational studies were carried out and different cases and combinations were analyzed for the car model by varying incoming airflow angle and spoiler angle and orientations of VG array to find out the optimum conditions for which drag coefficient is found minimum. Shear stress transport (SST) k-w turbulence model is found suitable in predicting the multi-scale rear-wake vortices of the car geometry. It is found that the crossflow increases the drag coefficient, which can however be reduced effectively if both VG array and rear-spoiler are used. Parametric analysis shows that counter-rotating VG array is found useful in reducing drag (around 23 %) as it promotes better flow mixing at its downstream, which is helpful in avoiding flow separation. The finding is also supported by the flow visualization study. It is also found that saving up to 11.5 % in the fuel consumption can be achieved by reducing drag using these techniques. The wake analysis and turbulent kinetic energy plots indicated that the counterrotating VG array while used with a rear spoiler parallel to the flow reduced drag considerably."

"Keeping calm and carrying on: International students in lockdown Education; Acculturative Stress; Studies Abroad What has been the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on international students and how have they coped with living, often in isolation, in a foreign country? This article examines the challenges and coping strategies of current and recently grad-uated higher degree by research (HDR) international students in the Australian city of Melbourne through a transient migration lens. Through interviews with eight international students during one of Melbourneâ€™s lockdown periods, this pilot study provided participants the opportunity to explain that not only were they dealing with the difficulties posed by lockdowns (e.g., loneliness and lack of sense of belonging) but doing so while balancing non-lockdown-related issues as students and transient migrants (e.g., passing their degree courses). Students interviewed however also revealed that they made the most out of lockdowns while taking charge of their own well-being by working towards their postgraduate futures and using the time to discover new non-study-related talents (e.g., water-colouring). The results of this study provide international education stakeholders and higher education institutions with ways of moving forward in the student support space."

"Review on development of high-static-low-dynamic-stiffness seat cushion mattress for vibration control of seating suspension system Rigidity; Harmonic Balance; Stiffness This review focuses on studying passive vibration isolation techniques and their applications. Advantages and disadvantages of different vibration isolation techniques will be compared in order to find an innovative method to reduce seating suspension system vibration and improve the ride comfort of vehicles' drivers. Quasi-zero stiffness (QZS) isolators of high-static-low-dynamic stiffness are found to have good application prospects in low-frequency vibration isolation. In order to improve the isolation performance of the seating suspension system, a specially made seat cushion will be studied where a quasi-zero stiffness (QZS) isolator such as a double-diamond isolator is selected as one of the cells/units/elements of the seat cushion mattress. The double-diamond isolator structure does not represent the whole seating suspension system. The transmissibility ratio of the double-diamond isolator is evaluated by analytical and simulation models and compared to that of a conventional linear spring isolator. Although the performance of the passive vibration isolation/control system is usually worse than that of the active or semi-active control system, the cost of the passive vibration isolation/control system is lower than that of the active and semi-active control system, and the relative simplicity of adding a vibration isolation cushion mattress in an existing passive seating suspension system makes it low in cost, easy to implement, and more attractive than the active and semi-active vibration control systems."

"How Far is Up? Bringing the counterpointed triad technique to digital storybook apps Nursery Schools; Preschool Education; Kindergarten Interactive storybooks, such as those available on the iPad, offer multiple ways to convey a story, mostly through visual, textual and audio content. How to effectively deliver this combination of content so that it supports positive social and educational development in pre-literate children is relatively underexplored. In order to address this issue we introduce the ""Counterpointed Triad Technique"". Drawing from traditional literary theory we design visual, textual and audio content that each conveys different aspects of a story. We explore the use of this technique through a storybook we designed ourselves called ""How Far Is Up?"". A study involving 26 kindergarten children shows that ""How Far Is Up?"" can engage pre-literature children while they are reading alone and also when they are reading with an adult. Based on our craft knowledge and study findings, we present a set of design strategies that aim to provide designers with practical guidance on how to create engaging interactive digital storybooks."

"Ammonia Synthesis by Alkaline Membrane Based Electrolysis: CSIRO PhD Scholarship (PhD Candidate: Song Huang) Ammonia is produced via the Haber-Bosch process that requires high energy input (~500°C and 150-300 bar) and results in carbon emission (releases about half of the UK CO2 every year) and consumes about 2% of the global fossil fuel energy. Based on the energy content of ammonia (5.2 MWh per tonne), more than 50% of the energy is lost in the synthesis process alone.  Therefore, there is enormous potential for reducing energy losses in synthesis process by developing alternative synthesis route, and that also uses renewable energy, so the process is emission-less. This project aims to directly synthesize ammonia using an alkaline membrane
based electrolysis."

"Increased nitrogen-vacancy centre creation yield in diamond through electron beam irradiation at high temperature Color Centers; Nitrogen; Nanodiamonds The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre is a fluorescent defect in diamond that is of critical importance for applications from ensemble sensing to biolabelling. Hence, understanding and optimising the creation of NV centres in diamond is vital for technological progress in these areas. We demonstrate that simultaneous electron irradiation and annealing of a high-pressure high-temperature diamond sample increases the NV centre creation efficiency from substitutional nitrogen defects by up to 117% with respect to a sample where the processes are carried out consecutively, but using the same process parameters. This increase in fluorescence is supported by visible and infrared absorption spectroscopy experiments. Our results pave the way for a more efficient creation of NV centres in diamond as well as higher overall NV densities in the future."
"Redox reaction at sulfide mineral surfaces Developing a mechanistic understanding of how ore materials react under different conditions is pivotal to developing a more efficient processing to recover metals, to reducing waste streams and to enhancing  the ability to remediate existing mining landscapes. This Project will use advanced microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to examine in situ microscale changes in chemical species at the surface layers of sulfide minerals and soils under operational and environmental conditions. Detailed knowledge of chemical mechanisms could underpin potential advances for green mining and environmental management.
Overall this Project will increase the fundamental understanding of sulfide mineral activity, enabling (a) the development and optimization of innovative processing protocols for sulfide ores, especially those which have previously been considered too difficult to process, and (b) the development of new approaches/protocols toward acid prevention and mine waste management."

We are interested in the deeper explanations for this, not currently covered by the questions asked in innovation surveys, such as why does Australia lack behind other OECD countries; what is particular about the Australian economy or industry structure that explains the lack of collaboration; and how do SMEs define collaboration with RIs (attending seminar, internship, co-funded research, or other)."
"A Stochastic Geometry Approach for Analyzing Uplink Performance for IoT-over-Satellite Satellite Communications; Antenna; Moment Generating Function Recent satellite constellations are being deployed to serve massive numbers of wireless devices, especially targeting those located in rural and offshore settings. Accordingly, business models relying on data reported via wireless Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks can now easily utilize satellite constellations to expand their offerings. In this paper, we present an analytic framework for modeling the uplink performance of massive IoT-over-Satellite networks. The framework utilizes tools from stochastic geometry to model the satellites and the users as two random point processes enabling the development of a tractable analytic model for the uplink outage probability. Furthermore, the paper derives the expected normalized throughput and compares the results to Monte-Carlo simulations for intractable constellations such as the Walker models adopted by current satellite deployments. Comparisons show that random constellations provide a tractable lower bound to the performance and average throughput compared to Walker constellations. The analytic model can provide the fast estimation of the uplink performance aiding in designing the IoT-over-Satellite system."

"Understanding challenges to diversity in the music industry in a time of crisis Despite the many advances made in gender equality in Australian society, women are still extremely under-represented in the music industry. For example, only one in five APRA AMCOS members identifies as female, and surveys of festival and gig line-ups have
revealed the overwhelming dominance of cis white males on stages. This problem is wellrecognised and significant work has been undertaken over the last five years on all levels of the industry to better understand and remedy this situation. This work has extended to
various programs designed to improve representation of many other previously marginalised groups in the industry.
Any progress made during this time is, however, at risk of being lost because of the COVID-19 crisis. During the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, research showed that in the creative industries women were more likely to be laid off or lose work. Studies have shown that in
times of crisis creative workers’ more risk-averse working patterns include retreating to trusted networks of collaborators which, while understandable, has gendered outcomes, as one of the most frequently cited reasons for women (and others) being disadvantaged in
these industries is the exclusionary nature of such networks.
This proposed research project is designed to provide a snapshot of the changes taking place as the industry adjusts to the crisis, and begins to make plans for rebuilding. The information gathered by the proposed project will be of vital importance if the industry is to
retain the focus on inclusivity that has emerged in recent years. "

"Trans-chalcone plus baicalein synergistically reduce intracellular amyloid beta (Aβ42) and protect from Aβ42 induced oxidative damage in yeast models of Alzheimer’s disease Baicalein; Flavonoid; Scutellaria Baicalensis Finding an effective therapeutic to prevent or cure AD has been difficult due to the com-plexity of the brain and limited experimental models. This study utilized unmodified and genetically modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model organisms to find potential natural bioactive compounds capable of reducing intracellular amyloid beta 42 (AÎ²42) and associated oxidative damage. Eleven natural bioactive compounds including mangiferin, quercetin, rutin, resveratrol, epigallo-catechin gallate (EGCG), urolithin A, oleuropein, rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid B, baicalein and trans-chalcone were screened for their ability to reduce intracellular green fluorescent protein tagged AÎ²42 (GFP-AÎ²42) levels. The two most effective compounds from the screens were combined in varying concentrations of each to study the combined capacity to reduce GFP-AÎ²42. The most effective combinations were examined for their effect on growth rate, turnover of native AÎ²42 and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The bioactive compounds except mangiferin and urolithin A signif-icantly reduced intracellular GFP-AÎ²42 levels. Baicalein and trans-chalcone were the most effective compounds among those that were screened. The combination of baicalein and trans-chalcone syn-ergistically reduced GFP-AÎ²42 levels. A combination of 15 Î¼M trans-chalcone and 8 Î¼M baicalein was found to be the most synergistic combination. The combination of the two compounds signifi-cantly reduced ROS and AÎ²42 levels in yeast cells expressing native AÎ²42 without affecting growth of the cells. These findings suggest that the combination of baicalein and trans-chalcone could be a promising multifactorial therapeutic strategy to cure or prevent AD. However, further studies are recommended to look for similar cytoprotective activity in humans and to find an optimal dosage."

"Industry Engagement and Intellectual Property (IP) Enhancement for Microbial Detection Assay Strips (MIDAS) kits Activity Summary and Innovation:
A rapid, low-cost, portable, point-of-use assay for the detection of pathogens such as helminths and enteric viruses in wastewater and biosolids.
This system represents an accurate, rapid and cost-effective technology with the potential to replace polymerase chain reaction based detection methods, which are technically challenged and not ideal for onsite (point-of-care) detection of microbes/viruses in wastewater treatment plants.
Currently, the PCR-based methods are used for the detection of microorganisms in wastewater however these methods are not portable and requires technical skills to conduct the assays. In addition, PCR-based methods take longer from test to result and there are increased costs associated with the transport of samples to off-site laboratories that have PCR equipment.
The paper based dipstick has been designed to develop qualitative or quantitative rapid test systems for simultaneous detection of two different pathogens. 
We have demonstrated this technology to Melbourne Water (MW) and MW has shown a strong interest in investing in either as a co-developer or investor.
• As requested by MW a detailed non-confidential brief with various investment/business models has been developed and shared with MW.
• However, Melbourne Water has further asked for a detailed Business plan with a comprehensive IP position on this technology."

"On the evaluation of confidence levels with application to GNSS Geodetic Network; Geodesy; Outlier The goal of this contribution is to assess the impact statistical model selection has on confidence levels of parameter estimators in linear(ized) GNSS models. In the processing of observational data, parameter estimation and statistical testing are often combined. A testing procedure is exercised to select the most likely observational model among the hypothesized ones, which is then followed by the estimation of the identified model parameters. The resulting estimator will inherit the uncertainties involved in both estimation and testing which need to be properly taken into account when computing the corresponding confidence level. The approach that is usually followed in practice to determine the confidence level is to compute the probability of the estimator lying in a region around its true value conditioned on the identified hypothesis. Therefore, use is made of the estimator's distribution under the identified hypothesis without regard to the conditioning process that led to the decision of accepting this hypothesis. In this contribution, it will be shown that for a proper computation of the confidence level in combined estimation-testing procedures, the associated probability should be conditioned not only on the identified hypothesis, but also on the testing outcome that led to the decision of accepting this hypothesis. Therefore, use need to be made of the conditional distribution of the estimator. We will provide numerical analysis of confidence levels with and without accounting for conditioning on testing decision using a number of examples in the context of GNSS single point positioning. It will be demonstrated that the customary practice which makes use of unconditional distributions to evaluate the confidence level, may give a too optimistic description of the estimator's quality."

"Exploring electric field assisted van der Waals weakening of stratified crystals Molybdenum Disulfide; Monolayer; Van Der Waals We report an enhancement in the efficiency of agitative liquid-phase exfoliation of stratified WS2 crystals under the influence of an electric field. We have been successfully able to increase the exfoliation efficiency of WS2 nanoflakes using a co-applied alternating electric field. Loss of centrosymmetry at the facial layers of WS2, together with the matching between the dispersive component of this material and solvent that weakens the van der Waals forces, augment the exfoliation process. However, this is not seen for MoS2 and graphene. The outcomes provide the base for future investigations on the influence of electric field for the exfoliation of layered structures."

"SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION AND HEURISTIC CONTROL OF SEGMENTED AILERONS FOR ENHANCED STABILITY OF FIXED WING UAVS Path Following; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Fixed Wings Different from a conventional aircraft, an investigation on system identification and control design has been carried out on a small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with segmented ailerons. The multiple aileron setup is configured as a multi-input and single-output system, and each segment is modeled as a control input. Experiments are conducted in the wind tunnel to determine the frequency responses of the system and the corresponding transfer functions. Multiple PID controllers are designed and implemented in a cascaded form for each control surface. Furthermore, a heuristic switching control strategy is implemented for the aircraft where the multiple aileron segments perform as a single aileron pair in a normal flight condition and adapt to multi-segment control when encountering severe turbulence or significant angle reference changes. Experimental results reveal that although each control surface can stabilize the aircraft, the proposed control strategy by combining the multiple actuation surfaces reduces the mean squared errors for the roll angle up to 38 percent in the highly turbulent environment providing superior disturbance rejection properties."

"Digital communities at work: Singapore Poetry Writing Month Creative Writing Workshop; Cyclic AMP; Transformative Learning This article outlines the development of the Singapore Poetry Writing Month (SingPoWriMo) digital community, organised around an annual month-long poem-a-day, prompt-based writing challenge carried out on Facebook. As a highly active digital writing community, SingPoWriMo has generated more poetry in English in its six-year history than the Singapore literary community has since independence. The poems posted on SingPoWriMo are able to reach the groupâ€™s population of more than 7,000 members without the traditional filters to publication such as editorial input, publisher selection, economic choice and transaction, and critical review. Conversely, social media provides selective replacements for some of these functions, via comment threads, â€˜likesâ€™ and other reactions, as well as Facebookâ€™s viral sharing function that allows poetry to reach an audience beyond the group. These factors of mass reach, rapidity, immediacy, and instant feedback have implications for the poetry generated, which goes on to integrate and remake traditional modes of publication and performance according to the qualities of a digital community. This article seeks to examine the historical antecedents and influences of high-volume, high-speed poetic output; the nature of the poetry being written in these digital writing communities; and the effects and implications of the SingPoWriMo phenomenon on the Singaporean and regional literary ecosystems. SingPoWriMo and its counterparts are new ways of writing that also create, and demand, new ways of understanding writing."
"SD-HOC: Seasonal decomposition algorithm for mining lagged time series HVAC; Intelligent Buildings; Sensor Mining time series data is a difficult process due to the lag factor and different time of data arrival. In this paper, we present Seasonal Decomposition for Human Occupancy Counting (SD-HOC), a customised feature transformation decomposition, novel way to estimate the number of people within a closed space using only a single carbon dioxide sensor. SD-HOC integrates time lag and line of best fit model in the preprocessing algorithms. SD-HOC utilises seasonal-trend decomposition with moving average to transform the preprocessed data and for each trend, seasonal and irregular component, different regression algorithms are modelled to predict each respective human occupancy component value. Utilising M5 method linear regression for trend and irregular component and dynamic time warping for seasonal component, a set of the prediction value for each component was obtained. Zero pattern adjustment model is infused to increase the accuracy and finally, additive decomposition is used to reconstruct the prediction value. The accuracy results are compared with other data mining algorithms such as decision tree, multi-layer perceptron, Gaussian processes - radial basis function, support vector machine, random forest, naÃ¯ve Bayes and support vector regression in two different locations that have different contexts."

"Interactive arts and disability: A conceptual model toward understanding participation Education; Tabletop; Multi-Touch In this paper we explore how social aspects of group interaction and the physical affordances of interactive technology may be exploited to enhance the participation of people with a disability in creative, artistic activity. Participation per se is conceptualized using a current framework known as the family of Participation Related Constructsâ€”fPRC, an ecological approach derived from a biopsychosocial health model. Taking an integrative approach, we blend current theory on participation, interaction design and community art to explore how group play and performance can foster inclusive participation in the arts and contribute to a positive change in personal (and collective) wellbeing. We describe two interactive arts projects called Resonance and Wheelchair DJ that provide examples of participation and performance in communities with a disability and reflect upon the workshop models that facilitate the creative expression of individuals and the group. We conclude with a discussion on the potentially transformative effects of participation in the arts by people with a disability and our gaps in our understanding of how to evaluate the notion of participation as a meansâ€”a medium through which person-related attributes and creative activity are developed in the longer-term."
"Structure-Reactivity Relations in Ruthenium Catalysed Furfural Hydrogenation Hydrogenation; Furfuryl Alcohol; 2-Methylfuran Furfural is an abundant and low-cost bio-derived platform chemical, obtained by xylose dehydration, and an important precursor to furfuryl alcohol and furan resins. The liquid phase selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol was systematically investigated over silica supported Ru nanoparticles to elucidate structure-reactivity relations and obtain mechanistic insight. Furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol is weakly structure sensitive for Ru nanoparticles spanning 2 to 25 nm, and the dominant reaction pathway reaching 95 % selectivity under our conditions (<25 bar H2 and 100â€“165 Â°C). In contrast, furfural decarbonylation to furan exhibits a strong structure sensitivity, being favoured over sub-10 nm particles. Increasing pH2 from 10 to 25 bar resulted in a modest increase in C=O hydrogenation, while higher temperatures promoted ring-opening of furfuryl alcohol."

"A kinematic model for assessment of hip joint range-of-motion in fast sport movements using spreading angles Athletes; Combat Sport; Black Belt The work investigates the relationship between the leg spread and hip joint flexibility during kicking action of highly skilled martial artists. Vector-based spreading angles (VSAs), as a simplified way to assess kick execution patterns and movement ranges, are proposed. The first VSA measures the angle between the two femur vectors (i.e., upper leg spread), whereas the second describes the full-leg spread. The proposed measures were applied to 3D motion analysis performed on 33 participants at various skill levels who executed double side kicks and performed two static flexibility tests (hip joint flexion and abduction). Statistical analysis showed that the proposed parameters differentiate between skill levels. Both VSAs and VSA rate of change showed high Pearson correlation to the quality of execution (the average of 10 subjective kickboxing expertsâ€™ evaluation scores) at critical instants of the kick execution, i.e., during the first leg elevation and kick (angles: Ï > 0.8; p < 0.001). In addition, they significantly correlated to maximum static hip abduction at any instant (Ï = 0.37â€“0.69; p < 0.05). The work established that both static and dynamic joint flexibility contribute to high-performance levels and could be used for initial selection and assessment of training effectiveness."

Its aim is to rapidly develop capability in this discipline and expand collaboration activities with more international researchers and research entities ? currently only with the Centre for Frugal Innovation at TUHH (Hamburg). To do so effectively we require the assistance of an assistant to grow our network by building a comprehensive database of FI scholars and centres around the world. This will help us to identify potential partners for collaboration in activities such as joint research papers, cotutelle agreements, forming international teams that submit research proposals for raising external funding (e.g. ARC Linkage, Food Agility CRC or international grant) and doing joint industry consultation. We shall have all of this completed by December 2019 from the Melbourne campus."
"How to Bake Quantum into Your Pet Petri Nets and Have Your Net Theory Too Stochastic Petri Nets; Markov Chain; Markov Processes Petri nets have found widespread use among many application domains, not least due to their human-friendly graphical syntax for the composition of interacting distributed and asynchronous processes and services, based in partial-order dependencies and concurrent executions. Petri nets also come with abstract semantics, and mathematical methods for compositional synthesis, structural checks and behavioural analysis. These have led to the use of various kinds of nets for real-time, distributed and parallel programming languages, software and services systems, with a view to their interfaces and interaction protocols. These affordances make Petri nets invaluable for distributed software architecture approaches focused on components, their mutual dependencies and environment-facing interactions. Quantum computing â€“ and in particular quantum software engineering â€“ is in its infancy and could benefit from the accumulated insights of software architecture research and of net theory, its methods, and its applications. In this paper, we establish a connection between Petri nets and quantum systems, such that net theory and the component architecture of nets may help in the synthesis and analysis of abstract software models and their interface protocols in hybrid classical-and-quantum programming languages and services systems. We leverage some insights from net formalisms for software specification for a versatile recipe to bake quantum into extant Petri net flavours, and prove universality and compositionality of Petri nets for quantum programming."

Besides elucidating the fundamental physicochemical and biological mechanisms underpinning this new method of intracellular transport through a combination of theoretical modelling and advanced imaging and neutron diffraction, the project aims to show the scalability of the technology for high throughput processing to handle the large cell numbers typically required for doses to be effective in practice. Given recent breakthroughs in cell therapies, it is expected that translation of the technology in the longer term will improve treatments for cancer and other infectious diseases."
"Using colloidal lithography to control the formation of gas sorption sites through galvanic replacement reaction Mercury Vapor; Quartz Crystal Microbalances; Gold Nanoparticle Using colloidal lithography, a series of inverted long-range ordered crystals (i-LROCs) of Pd honeycombs were fabricated on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors. The structures formed provided the required platform for the proceeding galvanic replacement reaction (GR) process to generate seamless Au nanoparticle deposits throughout the i-LROC. The results showed that controlling the dimensions of the pores in the developed Pd i-LROCs is important in the formation of gold deposition sites on the uniform structures through the GR reaction process. The developed Pd/Au i-LROC deposited sensors showed significant enhancement in the sensitivity toward Hg 0 vapor when compared to pure Pd structures, with limit of detection improving from 60.0 to 13.7 Âµg/m 3 , respectively. Furthermore, a significant improvement in the modified sensor's selectivity toward Hg 0 in the presence of other industrial related gas species was observed which is attributed to the addition of Au to the Pd structures through GR reaction."
"Wearable sensors for gait assessment of neuromotor disorder patients to prevent freezing of gait Associated with ageing population and rise in degenerative neuromotor disorders, there is the increase in falls due to freezing of gait (FOG), especially among patients of Parkinson’s disease. There are more people suffering from injuries due to falls [Yatar, and Yildirim 2015] than people having cardiovascular disease. Most of these are preventable if a timely cue is provided to the patient. This requires detecting the condition which requires the monitoring of the gait of these individuals and giving the required interventional cues [Solanki et al., 2017]. It has also been shown that risk of falls can be identified by assessment of the gait and posture of the person, while its trends can be better understood by investigating the muscle activity. Based on this, suitable cues and timely intervention can prevent many falls among the elderly patients of Parkinson’s disease [Patel et al., 2017]. 

The current gait analysis is performed using high speed multiple video cameras and pressure mats placed over the purpose-built walkway. These methods are useful in identifying abnormalities in the gait and posture of the patient but require large infrastructure laboratories that are expensive and located in major urban hospitals. These require extensive manual observations which make it impossible for real-time cues to the patients that will help improve their behaviors or give real-time feedback to the patients. The other shortcoming in such gait-analysis is that the person is not located in their personal comfort zone and thus their gait is not natural. There is an urgent need for wearable wireless gait analysis devices that can be used to record the walking of the individual while having the freedom of walking naturally in their own homes. "

"Qualitative Spatial Reasoning over Questions Geographic Information Retrieval; Place; Geographic Mapping Although geospatial question answering systems have received increasing attention in recent years, existing prototype systems struggle to properly answer qualitative spatial questions. In this work, we propose a unique framework for answering qualitative spatial questions, which comprises three main components: a geoparser that takes the input questions and extracts place semantic information from text, a reasoning system which is embedded with a crisp reasoner, and finally, answer extraction, which refines the solution space and generates final answers. We present an experimental design to evaluate our framework for point-based cardinal direction calculus (CDC) relations by developing an automated approach for generating three types of synthetic qualitative spatial questions. The initial evaluations of generated answers in our system are promising because a high proportion of answers were labelled correct."

"Epoxy/graphene nanocomposites prepared by in-situ microwaving Graphene Oxide; Nanofiltration Membranes; Graphite Many preparation methods reported for polymer/graphene nanocomposites are associated with graphene surface modification and consumption of organic solvents. A facile, green and novel approach has been developed in this study for preparation of epoxy/graphene nanocomposites. The approach involves microwaving a commercial graphene precursor and mechanically stirring to produce graphene platelets in a hot, liquid-state epoxy resin, eliminating the need for organic solvents and surfactants. The process created both single-layer graphene and graphene platelets of 4.17 Â± 0.63 nm in thickness and 1.00â€“4.77 Î¼m in lateral dimension. Most of the surface oxygenated groups survived in this process, and more importantly, the process grafted epoxy molecules with graphene platelets. A thin film of platelets displayed an electrical conductivity of 889 Â± 141 S/cm. The platelets caused large improvements to the mechanical and functional properties of the epoxy, i.e. 175% increase in critical strain energy release rate at 1.03 vol% of graphene, 14.9% increase in Young's modulus at 1.55 vol%, a percolation threshold of electrical conductivity at 0.85 vol%, and a glass transition temperature increment from 85.4 to 100.0 Â°C at 1.03 vol%. The research clearly demonstrates the use of microwave radiation as an environmentally sustainable, low-cost and simple method for the development of polymer nanocomposites containing exfoliated and well-dispersed graphene platelets."

"Reducing GHG emissions and treating contaminants using own resources: A new lookout for water industries Biogas and biosolids are the two most valuable products generated from the treatment of wastewater. Biogas is used for energy generation while biosolids are beneficiated for agriculture land application. The presence of emerging contaminants such as PFAS and micro-plastics in biosolids poses some serious concerns about their land applications. In today?s carbon constrained world, the greenhouse gas emissions from biogas combustion may not be acceptable. Water industries are constantly searching for cost-effective solutions to deal with emerging contaminants and reduce their carbon emissions. From the preliminary work conducted by the current PhD student under the supervision of A/Prof Kalpit Shah, it has been successfully demonstrated that biosolids and biogas can be converted into hydrogen and carbon nanomaterials. Hydrogen can be used for clean energy generation while carbon nanomaterials can be used for removing PFAS and other contaminants from the wastewater stream. The current proposal provides cost-effective alternative that can deal with emerging contaminants and reduce carbon emissions issues in an integrated manner."
"Assessment of the Actual and Potential Contributions of Smart City Projects to Climate Resilience in Selected Asia-Pacific Cities Smart city initiatives enabled by Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are deemed essential for helping cities to develop transformative solutions to address the challenges of global change and to create just, sustainable, and resilient communities. Several countries in the AsiaPacific region (e.g., Japan, Taiwan, China, Australia, and India) are at the forefront of designing/implementing smart city projects. While a vast body of knowledge exists on the contributions of such projects to sustainability and quality of life, little is known about their contributions to climate resilience and climate action planning. As many cities in the region are exposed to a broad array of climate-related disasters, enhancing resilience is expected to be at the center of smart city development efforts. Accordingly, the main aim of the proposed project is to investigate the contributions of selected smart city projects to climate resilience. Through inter- and
trans- disciplinary methods and workshops that involve a wide range of stakeholders, we will develop a smart city resilience assessment toolkit and use it to examine actual and/or potential performance of selected cases in Australia, China, Taiwan, India, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, and the United States. Results will provide useful scientific and policy knowledge on how to integrate resilience thinking into smart city developments and will also highlight lessons that can be transferred to less developed countries.

"Mali and Bougainville: new perspectives on international engagement in complex, heterogeneous security environments This project aims to contribute to more realistic, nuanced and ultimately more effective international engagement in complex, heterogeneous security and socio-political contexts. It does this through a study of conflict resolution, understood broadly (Ramsbotham et al 2011) in Mali and Bougainville (a region of Papua New Guinea), drawing on practice-informed theoretical insights from critical security and peace and conflict studies (e.g., Mac Ginty & Richmond 2016; Boege et al, 2009). These two cases are different in many respects. Both, however, are heterogeneous security contexts, characterised by complex interaction and interdependence among different forms of social and political order, and different providers of conflict resolution and security. State and traditional or
indigenous authorities are leading security and conflict resolution actors, but there are others that fit neatly into neither category. Both Mali and Bougainville are also on the UN Security Council agenda.
After being earlier touted as an example of a successful multi-ethnic state, Mali in the grip of a multilayered conflict without a clear way forward; Bougainville approaches a vote on independence from PNG against an earlier war of secession, followed by two decades of peacebuilding. Neither Mali nor Bougainville, at contrasting points in the `conflict cycle?, are fixed in conditions of violence or relative
peace, however, and both have much to say to each other and to international actors such as the UN regarding seeking and sustaining peace in complex, highly heterogeneous socio-political contexts."
"Extending the testing to a range of wastewater samples from regional Victoria The present work will extend the current project being conducted under the auspices of Water Research Australia and supported by South East Water. Currently, the project concentrates on South East Water wastewater samples and treatment process. Through the proposed work with Goulburn Valley Water, the technology will be tested on a range of wastewaters from a very different catchment and wastewater treatment process and thus its wider applicability determined. This will strengthen the major outcome of this project: the development of a systematic approach for selection of the most appropriate algae and technology configuration for nutrient removal, biogas production and overall cost."
"NSW RFS Get Ready Schools Program
Triple Zero Kids Challenge GAME CONCEPTS
While three concepts are being presented, only a single game is intended to be fully developed within the context of this budget estimate and proposal. The final selection should be a balance of innovative technology, user engagement and measurable learning outcomes. The final choice to be determined at the conclusion of key stakeholderbplanning and/or workshops, with a functional specification being fully approved before development commences.

The following game concepts all draw upon user participation content, either as a volunteered individual or as multi-player within a group.
The presenter can either be the primary driver or allow the presentation to be more digitally automated. While the first two concepts could be facilitated without any technology requirements, being able to use technology as means of input and output, allows for a fun interactive learning environment and the capture of analytical data to measure reach and effectiveness.

As each school will have access to unique resources, all concepts will have recommendations for fallback options where technology in the school environment may be a challenge. However, it most cases it is assumed that a high percentage of schools will have at least access to a Smartboard and an internet connection. In some cases a mobile device with cellular access to the internet may be sufficient."

"Hyper-heuristic online learning for self-assembling swarm robots Timetabling Problem; Hyper-heuristics; Genetic Algorithm A robot swarm is a solution for difficult and large scale tasks. However, controlling and coordinating a swarm of robots is challenging, because of the complexity and uncertainty of the environment where manual programming of robot behaviours is often impractical. In this study we propose a hyper-heuristic methodology for swarm robots. It allows robots to create suitable actions based on a set of low-level heuristics, where each heuristic is a behavioural element. With online learning, the robot behaviours can be improved during execution by autonomous heuristic adjustment. The proposed hyper-heuristic framework is applied to surface cleaning tasks on buildings where multiple separate surfaces exist and complete surface information is difficult to obtain. Under this scenario, the robot swarm not only needs to clean the surfaces efficiently by distributing the robots, but also to move across surfaces by self-assembling into a bridge structure. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the hyper-heuristic framework; the same group of robots was able to autonomously deal with multiple surfaces of different layouts. Their behaviours can improve over time because of the online learning mechanism."

"Host cell kinome as a target for the treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection SARS-CoV-2 is a major public health challenge. There are no effective treatments and the impact on the public health systems, including in all Australian states, is unprecedented in living memory.
Viruses rely on host cell signalling pathways for their replication. We will identify key host cell signalling proteins activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection and validate their potential as targets for curative drugs. This project will establish synergistic cooperation between two Victorian research institutions with complementary capabilities/expertise: RMIT University (kinomics of infectious systems) and Melbourne Health/Doherty Institute (SARS-CoV-2 cell and molecular biology).
Our innovative approach to prevent viral replication by inhibiting human signalling enzymes opens a new avenue in anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery, based on untapped targets that will offer low propensity for resistance. This strategy overcomes two major problems that impairs anti-infective drug development:
(i) Drug resistance. Targeting human enzymes deprives the virus of the fastest mechanism for drug resistance, namely the selection of mutated resistant targets.
(ii) Targeting host-cell kinases opens the well-funded cancer drug discovery pipeline to antiviral drug development. Inhibitors that are already approved for use in humans can be rapidly progressed to clinical trails and repurposed as a treatment for SARs-CoV-2 infection."

"Rapid Assessment of the Impact of COVID-19 on Wet Market Reforms: Case Studies from Vietnam, Kenya, and Phillipines The COVID-19 pandemic is the most significant shock to global and local food systems since the financial crisis of 2008. In the livestock sector, lockdowns and movement restrictions have significantly impacted animal trade, abattoirs, and consumer markets. The animal origins of COVID-19 have once again placed concerns about zoonotic diseases into the global policy limelight. Wet markets in Asia have been singled out as a source of global pandemic risk with calls to close, ban, regulate, and reform them. The concerns about wet markets centre heavily on wild animals and link calls for veterinary public health and biosecurity reforms with concerns about biological and ecological conservation, the (illegal) global wildlife trade, animal welfare and animal rights. However wild animals represent only a small fraction of the livestock sold at wet markets. While emerging pandemics represent low probability but high impact events, endemic food-borne and zoonotic diseases (Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli, etc.) contribute to more frequent and significant local disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the framing of wet markets as sources of disease and threats to biological diversity do not take into account their enduring positive contributions to local nutrition, livelihoods, and sociocultural wellbeing. Draconian governance and management reforms aimed solely at reducing zoonotic infection risks may have unintended negative socioeconomic, health and wellbeing consequences for communities and the resilience of food systems. This project will be led by RMIT, with expert partners from the Planetary and Global Health Program at St. Luke’s Medical Center College, one of the leading medical schools in the Philippines; the Institute for Anthropology, Gender and African Studies at the University of Nairobi, Kenya; and the Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences."
"Analytical solution for an acoustic boundary layer around an oscillating rigid sphere Acoustic Levitation; Acoustics; Bessel Beam Analytical solutions in fluid dynamics can be used to elucidate the physics of complex flows and to serve as test cases for numerical models. In this work, we present the analytical solution for the acoustic boundary layer that develops around a rigid sphere executing small amplitude harmonic rectilinear motion in a compressible fluid. The mathematical framework that describes the primary flow is identical to that of wave propagation in linearly elastic solids, with the difference being the appearance of complex instead of real valued wave numbers. The solution reverts to the well-known classical solutions in special limits: the potential flow solution in the thin boundary layer limit, the oscillatory flat plate solution in the limit of large sphere radius, and the Stokes flow solutions in the incompressible limit of infinite sound speed. As a companion analytical result, the steady second order acoustic streaming flow is obtained. This streaming flow is driven by the Reynolds stress tensor that arises from the axisymmetric first order primary flow around such a rigid sphere. These results are obtained with a linearization of the non-linear Navier-Stokes equations valid for small amplitude oscillations of the sphere. The streaming flow obeys a time-averaged Stokes equation with a body force given by the Nyborg model in which the above-mentioned primary flow in a compressible Newtonian fluid is used to estimate the time-averaged body force. Numerical results are presented to explore different regimes of the complex transverse and longitudinal wave numbers that characterize the primary flow."

"In the Game: Overcoming barriers and parental attitudes towards physical activity outcomes of Muslim girls on the fringes of Melbourne This study examines the reasons and circumstances that affect parents’ decisions to facilitate their daughter's participation in physical activity and sports. With a focus on health equity, we will examine factors such as socio-economic status of families, occupation of parents, single parenthood, number of children, safety concerns, and cultural and religious factors such as attitudes toward female children, as well as the impact of coming from refugee or newly arrived migrant backgrounds that may influence parental attitudes towards their children's physical activity. While there is a plethora of literature available on the importance of physical activity for children, there is insufficient in-depth data that focuses on Muslim girls in Victoria. The poor participation of this section of the Victorian community in physical activity needs to be examined and better understood in order to achieve health equity. Moreover, considering the cultural and linguistic diversity within Muslim communities, ethno-specific issues need to be addressed alongside over-arching similarities that stem from their religious belief and practice. The in-depth mixed method study aims to address this set of interrelated issues and unused potentials."
"Natural compounds from the marine brown alga caulocystis cephalornithos with potent in vitro-activity against the parasitic nematode haemonchus contortus Haemonchus Contortus; Monepantel; Anthelmintic Agent Eight secondary metabolites (1 to 8) were isolated from a marine sponge, a marine alga and three terrestrial plants collected in Australia and subsequently chemically characterised. Here, these natural product-derived compounds were screened for in vitro-anthelmintic activity against the larvae and adult stages of Haemonchus contortus (barberâ€™s pole worm)â€”a highly pathogenic parasitic nematode of ruminants. Using an optimised, whole-organism screening system, compounds were tested on exsheathed third-stage larvae (xL3s) and fourth-stage larvae (L4s). Anthelmintic activity was initially evaluated on these stages based on the inhibition of motility, development and/or changes in morphology (phenotype). We identified two compounds, 6-undecylsalicylic acid (3) and 6-tridecylsalicylic acid (4) isolated from the marine brown alga, Caulocystis cephalornithos, with inhibitory effects on xL3 and L4 motility and larval development, and the induction of a â€œskinny-straightâ€ phenotype. Subsequent testing showed that these two compounds had an acute nematocidal effect (within 1â€“12 h) on adult males and females of H. contortus. Ultrastructural analysis of adult worms treated with compound 4 revealed significant damage to subcuticular musculature and associated tissues and cellular organelles including mitochondria. In conclusion, the present study has discovered two algal compounds possessing acute anthelmintic effects and with potential for hit-to-lead progression. Future work should focus on undertaking a structure-activity relationship study and on elucidating the mode(s) of action of optimised compounds."
"Regional Tasmania Walkability The Australian Urban Observatory (AUO) is a digital portal developed at RMIT University measuring and
mapping liveability across Australia’s 21 largest cities at Local Government Area (LGA) level and down to
suburbs and local neighbourhood.

Walkability for transport is calculated based on three key factors: land use mix and services of daily
living (something to walk to); street connectivity (a way to get there); and dwelling density (higher
population densities are associated with increased populations needed to supply services and different
land uses) (Giles-Corti et al., 2014). These factors influence how people move around their local
neighbourhoods to complete everyday activities and the importance of access to supermarkets,
convenience stores, petrol stations, newsagents and public transport stops in community design.
Extensive research literature has consistently shown that local neighbourhood design is an important
influence of physical activity, health outcomes, social connectedness and sustainability (Saelens et al.,
2003).

The AUO currently includes five separate walkability indicators: average distance to closest activity centre,
average dwelling density per hectare, average street connectivity per square kilometre, average number
of daily living destinations present (0-3) within 1600m, and walkability for transport index. An example of
suburb level differences of the average street connectivity per square kilometre is provided in Figure 1
overleaf.

The AUO has been approached by the University of Tasmania (UTAS) School of Health Sciences to
analyse school walkability for primary and secondary schools, and their spatial correlation to food outlets

"Attitudes and behaviors as predictors of service quality in the telecommunications sector context Personnel; Civic Virtue; Transformational Leadership Purpose: Service quality (SQ) is considered an organizational performance indicator that largely depends on employeesâ€™ attitudes and behaviors. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the mediating effect of employeesâ€™ citizenship behavior (OCB) on the relationship between affective commitment (AC) and SQ. Design/methodology/approach: The current study has relied on two questionnaire surveys to gather cross-sectional data from 800 employees and 400 customers of telecommunications companies in Kuwait. Structural equation modeling via AMOS22 was used to build and test the hypothesized model. Findings: The results show that OCB significantly and positively affects SQ dimensions except empathy which demonstrates insignificant association. Also, AC was found to be a strong predictor of OCB. More interestingly, the results show that AC does not show any effect on either responsiveness or empathy, while a partial mediation was found between AC and tangibles, reliability, and assurance. Practical implications: The findings of the current study provide managers and practitioners with empirically validated model of how SQ can be achieved. The model indicates that managers need to increase the level of citizenship behavior through leveraging their employeesâ€™ AC, which in turn can result in a positive perception of SQ. Originality/value: This study is considered among the first to investigate the causal effect of both OCB and AC on achieving high SQ. Also, the findings of this study further support the indirect relationship of AC and SQ. Moreover, this study is unique in its attempt to link both AC and OCB to the dimensions of SQ. Finally, this study is considered the first empirical investigation of SQ in the telecommunication sector in Kuwait."

"Consumer fridge behaviour and waste reduction of red
 meat Greenleaf reported markdown and waste from the Australian beef supply chain is costing roughly $7.8 million p.a. (MLA, 2019). This is partly caused by short date labelling, based on data from a 1997 survey. Consumers predominately assess if meat is still safe by the date label, which is conservative because of outdated data, and appliance development and changing consumer behaviour over the last 20 years. We propose to conduct a two-phase project. In Phase 1 (this proposal), we will provide new temperature and consumer data for commodities requiring chilled storage to use for setting new standards and to provide information for industry and consumers. Adopting a holistic fridge/freezer, packaging, and consumer information/education approach, the project will help redress the problems above.
Based on the results of Phase 1, Phase 2 (not included in this proposal), will develop easy to understand and effective interventions to engage consumers in reducing meat waste. "

"Flight-relevant gusts: Computation-derived guidelines for mav ground test unsteady aerodynamics Soaring; Helicopter; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Flow around a nominally cuboid building immersed in a suburban atmospheric boundary layer is simulated using an improved, delayed, detached large eddy model. Gusts perceived by Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) flying through these flows are considered. While lateral/directional disturbances are more challenging, from a flight-perspective, than longitudinal ones, here we focus on relation between what the MAV encounters and how that relates to unsteady flowfields in wind tunnels, water tunnels or tow tanks. Specifically, the aim is to offer prescription for angles of attack, frequencies and amplitudes realizable in ground-test, that have bearing on the environment actually encountered in flight, for a range of wing loadings and proximities to a notional building. Thus, a longitudinal, two-dimensional worst-case gust is identified when a craft flies through the shear layer emanating from the buildingâ€™s upwind top edge, with significant changes in angle of attack and velocity magnitude. While this â€œworst caseâ€ is not intended to bound any possible MAV flight challenges, it offers guidance on how aggressive an imposed-motion ought to be in a ground-test experiment, and thereby, how much flow-separation and associated unsteadiness would be expected."

"Remote Sensing of Riparian Vegetation Condition The objective of the project is to attempt to use remote sensing to classify riparian vegetation condition across Melbourne Water's region and across time. The project will cover all riparian areas (24,000 km) throughout Melbourne Water's region. Melbourne Water uses a categorical system of rating riparian vegetation condition, ranging from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Melbourne Water needs to report to our stakeholders, with regard to our progress with implementing the Healthy Waterways Strategy in 2022 and 2026 showing the current riparian vegetation condition and the vegetation condition in comparison to 2018. This is of particular importance in high quality (e.g level 4 and 5) riparian vegetation areas. The focus of year 1 of this research project is to ascertain whether it is likely to be possible to build a model to assess vegetation condition across Melbourne Water's entire waterway network and across time."
"Assessment of the use of a natural antibacterial product for reducing harmful bacterial colonisation of chickens; impact on food safety The project is a research project part funded under the State Government business R&D voucher program ""Boost your Business"", Food Innovation Vouchers operated by DEDJTR with a round recently closed for applicants. The project involves research to identify potential for a natural antibacterial agent used as a feed additive to chickens to improve health outcomes for the chickens resulting in lower rates of bacterial colonisation, and by extension improved economic outcomes for the farmers as well as food safety outcomes for the chicken meat. The project will run for 12 months and include animal studies. Part of the animal studies will be subcontracted to Scolexia (to be finalised and contracted) Ridley applied for a voucher under the DEDJTR Boost your Business Program Food Innovation Vouchers stream with assistance from RMIT. RMIT provided a quote for a work specification which has been accepted. (see attached letter) Under the voucher program, the industry partner is able to obtain funding support from the state govt of 50% of project value up to a maximum of 50k. Given the project value of 80613, that means the company is funding 40307 and the government 40306. The mechanism used for these projects is to bill the company up front for their contribution. At the end of the project, the parties complete a voucher and send certain supporting material to the government and RMIT then bills the government for the balance. There is no formal grant agreement between RMIT and DEDJTR. This mechanism is familiar to RMIT and has existed in the past, the current round is a new manifestation of the same programs (albeit with a higher co-contribution required from the company). RMIT has used the standard documentation for the project as per previous experience for these vouchers, being a modified version of the research shortform with the voucher details contained in special conditions of the Schedule."

"Habitat filters mediate successional trajectories in bacterial communities associated with the striped shore crab Nestedness; Macroinvertebrates; Ecosystem The relative importance of stochastic- and niche-based processes shifts during successional time and across different types of habitats. Microbial biofilms are known to undergo such successional shifts. However, little is known about the interaction between these successional trajectories and habitat filters. Harsh habitat filters could affect biofilm successional trajectories by strengthening niche-based processes and weakening stochastic processes. We used mesocosms to track successional trajectories in bacterial communities associated with the striped shore crab (Pachygrapsus transversus). We followed replicated microbial communities under strong and weak habitat filters associated with the crabâ€™s gut and carapace. For bacteria, colonization of the crabâ€™s gut is constrained by strong chemical and physical filtering, while the carapace remains relatively open for colonization. Consistent with successional models of bacterial biofilms, carapace microbial communities initially converged in community composition at day 8 and diverged thereafter. We expected gut microbial communities to deviate from the trajectory in the carapace and converge towards a subset of tolerant species. Instead, bacterial communities in the gut exhibited low richness, unchanging similarity in composition and turnover in species identities throughout the duration of our study. These habitat filter effects were linked with weak species interactions and low influence from colonization in the gut. If these findings are representative of differences in filter strength in a continuum of successional trajectories, habitat filters may provide basis for predictions that link successional models and habitat types."

"(A3P) Risk Management Plan: Fluoride in environmental releases in the Melbourne region- case study Cardinia and Olinda Creeks Melbourne Water has a requirement under the Yarra Environmental Entitlement 2006 to supply environmental passing
flows at Cardinia Creek below Cardinia Reservoir and Olinda Creek via Stoneyford Creek below Silvan Reservoir.
Current operation of the water supply results in these flows being supplied by Silvan Reservoir, which has no added
fluoride. There has been a recent change of supply operations whereby water is being pumped from Cardinia Reservoir
to Silvan Reservoir. As Cardinia Reservoir receives and stores water from the Victoria Desalination Project which is
fluoridated before transfer to Cardinia Reservoir, environmental passing flows to Cardinia and Olinda Creek will now
contain fluoride."

"The potential of marketing communications to protect social workers in times of crisis Persuasion; Storytelling; Messages Socially stigmatized service workers (SSWs) like probation officers, social workers, and even aged care workers are often subject to negative media scrutiny when a crisis occurs, leading to public outrage and subsequent high attrition rates. The primary focus of this study is to examine the potential for marketing communication to generate a state of empathic concern amongst the public towards SSWs because an empathic public is less likely to want to punish, despite media calls to do so. A case is presented for the use of marketing communication explained through the lens of narrative execution and the general theory of emotion. Using a content analysis of public service announcements from representative bodies of social workers, in the US, UK and Australia we find little evidence of strategic intent to use narrative format or elicit empathic concern. A call and direction for further research is made in light of this finding."

"Energy and Materials Recovery from Paunch Waste Using Novel Hydrothermal and Supercritical Water Gasification Processes - Phase 1 This multiphase project aims to investigate the feasibility of Hydrothermal Carbonisation and Supercritical Water Gasification processes for processing heavily moisture-laden paunch waste.  Paunch waste needs exhaustive pre-treatments before its thermochemical transformation to produce char and gas in a conventional pyrolyser or gasifier system. The processes proposed here completely eliminate this water removal step and generate value-added products such as hydro- or super- char (i.e. char produced from hydrothermal and supercritical conditions) and a high quality syngas enriched in hydrogen. The thermal and solids conversion
efficiencies with these advanced processes can be as high as 90-95%. The superior forms of char obtained can be functionalised for their applications in soil amendment, as adsorbent in waste water treatment or for advanced energy generation. If successful, it will resolve a number of ongoing and future socio-economic and environmental issues associated with waste disposal/treatment in Australian abattoirs.

"Research project regarding professional standards in the delivery of disability services According to data provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, 18.4% of Victoria’s population are people with a disability. The number of people with disability is increasing due to factors such as population growth, ageing and increased life expectancy. 
In December 2020, Victoria had 118,919 people in Victoria benefiting from the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) including 42,287 people receiving support for the first time. And NDIS participants are only part of the picture. There are many more people who access services and supports from disability workers in Victoria. 
Victorian NDIS participants and other Victorians with a disability who are not eligible for the NDIS have a right to services and supports that are high quality.  A series of inquiries – including the current Royal Commission – have highlighted the 
abuse, violence, neglect and exploitation of people with disability and emphasised the need for reforms that uphold the rights and ensure the safety and wellbeing of people with disability.

"Development of Cryptographic Library and Support System The protection of the whole cyber space relies on a foundation of cryptography. Cryptographic components of apps authenticate remote parties and secure the communications. However, cryptographic misuse has become a most common issue in development of security component, affecting up to 90% of apps! This project aims to research, design and develop a crypto library. The innovation of this project lays in three aspects: (1) we will develop a self-contained, reliable, compatible and verifiable crypto library; (2) we will develop
security test software automatically to test and verify security of codes; and (3) we will provide intelligent decision support through argumentation to help developers to apply the library efficiently and correctly. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any crypto library developed in Australia yet. After the completion of the project, we will collaborate with Australian industries to adapt the crypto library to meet their security requirements. This project will benefit Australia in cybersecurity research and economy. Australia loses
about 29 billions per year due to security incidents. This project will reduce the risk by reducing the potentially dangerous crypto errors caused by using the crypto library in the application development and implementation."

"A context-Aware recommendation system for improving the performance of targeted mobile advertising Mobile Advertising; Marketing; Online Advertisement Mobile advertising has evolved into an important category of interactive advertising because it enables advertisers to target users considering contextual factors (location, activities, devices etc.). Logically, this makes mobile applications better advertising platform to distribute advertisement enhanced by recommendation system. A recommendation system can efficiently suggest the most appropriate content of interest to users according to their preferences. Few prior studies have tried to incorporate context-Awareness into the recommendation system particularly in domain of mobile advertising. A key challenge is complexity of mobile contextual information and scalability of required algorithms. This study presents context-Aware collaborative filtering algorithms improving the relevancy of the prediction results. We first define context-Awareness of mobile advertising scenario, and then apply the context similarity to measure a novel user-context-advertisement model with tensor factorization. We propose an algorithmic extension of multiple-dimensional collaborative filtering to show that our proposed system can outperform to this problem."
"Semantics-Guided Contrastive Network for Zero-Shot Object detection Semantic Space; Zero; Image Classification Zero-shot object detection (ZSD), the task that extends conventional detection models to detecting objects from unseen categories, has emerged as a new challenge in computer vision. Most existing approaches on ZSD are based on a strict mapping-transfer strategy that learns a mapping function from visual to semantic space over seen categories, then directly generalizes the learned mapping function to unseen object detection. However, the ZSD task still remains challenging, since those works fail to consider the two key factors that hamper the ZSD performance: (a) the domain shift problem between seen and unseen classes leads to poor transferable ability of the model; (b) the original visual feature space is suboptimal for ZSD since it lacks discriminative information.To alleviate these issues, we develop a novel Semantics-Guided Contrastive Network for ZSD (ContrastZSD), a detection framework that first brings the contrastive learning paradigm into the realm of ZSD. The pairwise contrastive tasks take advantage of class label and semantic relation as additional supervision signals. Under the guidance of those explicit semantic supervision, the model can learn more knowledge about unseen categories to avoid over-fitting to the seen concepts."

"Varietal differences in the effect of rice ageing on starch digestion Retrogradation; Rice Starch; Digestion The purpose of this study was to provide, for the first time, a comprehensive account of the potential effects of storage (37 Â°C)on physicochemical properties and digestion behaviour of three highly consumed Iranian rice varieties (Hashemi, Domsiyah and Gohar). After ageing, the content of thiol groups was significantly reduced only in the case of Hashemi. The ageing process did not significantly change the rate and extent of starch digestion in Gohar and Domsiyah, but a clear reduction was observed in Hashemi. The results suggested that the changes in peptide subunit composition contribute to the potential efficiency of ageing for controlling rice digestion behaviour. This study suggests that varietal differences may play a major role in the effectiveness of ageing in modifying rice physicochemical properties and starch digestion dynamics. The results also indicated that starch digestibility didn't follow amylose content level and suggests the importance of other components on rice digestibility."

laboratory for understanding and improving women’s lives."
"Green Adelaide Marine Pest Research The Green Adelaide marine pest program is Adelaide's only dedicated surveillance monitoring for new marine pests incursions across eastern Gulf St Vincent. The program was established in 2016, and established an array of settlement plate sampling stations at strategic locations of high use boating traffic across Adelaide. Genetic and dive survey information obtained from the program is used to inform the state jurisdictional marine biosecurity reports, which is provided to the Commonwealth for reporting against the National biosecurity strategy. Combined with information of pest incursions identified through the marine biodiversity surveys of reef and seagrass ecosystems, these three programs form the evidence to assess native marine habitat and biodiversity health.

"From academia to reality check: A theoretical framework on the use of chemometric in food sciences Total Soluble Solids; Fruit; Near-Infrared Spectroscopy There is no doubt that the current knowledge in chemistry, biochemistry, biology, and mathematics have led to advances in our understanding about food and food systems. However, the so-called reductionist approach has dominated food research, hindering new developments and innovation in the field. In the last three decades, food science has moved into the digital and technological era, inducing several challenges resulting from the use of modern instrumental techniques, computing and algorithms incorporated to the exploration, mining, and description of data derived from this complexity. In this environment, food scientists need to be mindful of the issues (advantages and disadvantages) involved in the routine applications of chemometrics. The objective of this opinion paper is to give an overview of the key issues associated with the implementation of chemometrics in food research and development. Please note that specifics about the different methodologies and techniques are beyond the scope of this review."
"A machine learning based solution for space situational awareness and
 space sustainability: RP2: Advanced Satellite Systems, Sensors and Intelligence Z (PhD Candidate: Sai Krishna Reddy Vallapureddy) Space Situational Awareness (SSA) has not always been an integral part of space operation. It has now become the need of the hour for space sustainability after several satellite collisions and anti-satellite tests creating a lot of debris which is often referred to as “Space
Junk”. This Space Junk comes in various forms, shapes, and sizes. It can be either natural or manmade. Natural space debris consists of small pieces of cometary and asteroidal material called meteoroids. We see this natural debris as meteors when they travel through
the Earth's atmosphere. Artificial space debris is any non-functional man-made object in space (usually orbiting the Earth). There has been an estimated, upward of 500 breakups, explosions, collisions, or anomalous events resulting in fragmentation in the near-
Earth orbit. As of February 2020, the number of debris objects regularly tracked by Space Surveillance Networks and maintained in their catalogue is about 22,300. There are over 34,000 debris >10cm particles estimated by statistical models to be in orbit. There are over 900,000 debris objects between the range of 1 cm - 10 cm and a whopping 128 million debris objects between the range of 1 mm - 1 cm and exponentially more particles lower than 1mm.
Currently, SSA highly depends on ground-based capabilities limiting the accuracy of tracking objects to 10cm. This project will explore possible technological demonstration that utilizes International Space Station/ CubeSat payload for SSA alongside its efficiency and need for long-term space sustainability. The capability shall be achieved through machine learning as a part of the onboard computer.
The primary output will be a PhD thesis."
"Design of a Compact, Multifrequency, Multiconstellation GNSS Precise Point Positioning Correction Format Spacecraft; GLONASS; Ambiguity Resolution High-accuracy, high-precision global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) have been utilized by specialized user markets for over two decades. Traditional high-accuracy GNSS systems are not scalable as they require local infrastructure. Precise point positioning (PPP) is a GNSS position estimation technique that allows positioning and navigation with centimetre-level accuracy without local infrastructure. The caveat of PPP is the timely transmission of corrections to errors in the GNSS signals. Next-generation GNSS satellites such as Galileo, BeiDou, QZSS, and other local systems have plans to broadcast corrections for PPP services broadcast corrections for PPP services. However, since these services are expected to have limited channel capacity, the development of efficient formats for PPP corrections is needed. In this article, a messaging strategy for PPP corrections and testing its performance, in terms of data rate and obtained positioning accuracy, is proposed. Message formats in the literature require 522 bps or more to transmit corrections for 70 satellites. By contrast, the message format proposed in this article can transmit information corrections for more than 70 satellites using 52% of the standard satellite-based augmentation system channel's 212 bps capacity, while incurring less than 1 cm of positioning accuracy degradation."
"FPR2 is a therapeutic target in lung cancer The link between lung cancer and COPD risk extends beyond consumption of tobacco. Globally, lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer related deaths11 and despite the advances of new molecular therapies, the prognosis remains poor with an overall 5-year survival rate of 15%11. Cigarette smoking is the major preventable risk factor for developing lung cancer and accounts for approximately 85% of all cases. Lung cancers are broadly subdivided into histological types; where NSCLC represent 80-85% of all lung cancers. NSCLC are further classified into different subtypes where adenocarcinomas and squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) account for the majority of NSCLC cases. Although adenocarcinomas can occur in non-smokers, particularly Asian populations, cigarette smoking remains the major risk factor for developing NSCLC."
"Arbitrary access to optical carriers in silicon photonic mode/wavelength hybrid division multiplexing circuits Multiplexing; Photonics; Multimode Interference The manipulation of optical modes directly in a multimode waveguide without affecting the transmission of undesired signal carriers is of significance to realize a flexible and simple structured optical network-on-chip. In this Letter, an arbitrary optical mode and wavelength carrier access scheme is proposed based on a series of multimode microring resonators and one multimode bus waveguide with constant width. As a proof-of-concept, a three-mode (de)multiplexing device is designed, fabricated, and experimentally demonstrated. A new, to the best of our knowledge, phase-matching idea is employed to keep the bus waveguide width constant. The mode coupling regions and transmission regions of the microring resonators are designed carefully to selectively couple and transmit different optical modes. The extinction ratio of the microring resonators is larger than 21.0 dB. The mode and wavelength cross-talk for directly (de)multiplexing are less than âˆ’12.8 dB and âˆ’19.0 dB, respectively. It would be a good candidate for future large-scale multidimensional optical networks."

"Code-switching Identities: curating networked presence Non-binary gender identities pose a problem for international provision of education, health services and citizenship, and yet gender-diverse stories proliferate in a multitude of online spaces and are increasingly visible in mainstream media. Could the co-incidence of new ‘beyond-dualistic’ ways of being neither wholly male/female and online/offline, spell an end to finite and binary ways of being and doing gender? 

This project examines the intersections between emergent gender categories and fluid, multiple digital identities. It engages discrete groups of young gender-diverse people, their parents, educators, health providers and policy makers, in short creative workshops, where they each produce a pseudonymous, ‘ungendered’ selfie. These fragments of self will be curated in an online archive/website and exhibition at RMIT. Their images and reflections will be used as prompts at a Symposium in which we unpack the many ways we may like to be categorised and archived in more formal institutions of governance, education and citizenship.

"‘My desire to play was stronger than my fear of re-injury’: athlete perspectives of psychological readiness to return to soccer following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery Sport Injury; Wounds And Injuries; Athletes The aims of this qualitative study were to understand how athletes (a) defined psychological readiness and (b) knew when they were ready to return to soccer following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. Data were collected from a group of 21 (male and female) athletes who had undergone ACL reconstruction surgery and returned to playing soccer. An open-ended, in-depth online survey was created to gather data on athlete understandings of psychological readiness, their experiences of overcoming psychological barriers when returning to sport, and any emotions or complications associated with their return to sport. Two main themes were uncovered in this study: â€˜Having Confidenceâ€™ and â€˜Love of the Gameâ€™. This research offers a greater understanding of how psychological readiness is defined from the perspective of soccer players, (particularly those returning to lower levels of competition, such as local and regional amateur clubs), than has been found in previous research."

"Multi-Channel Parallel Silicon Mode-Order Converter for Multimode On-Chip Optical Switching Multiplexing; Photonics; Multimode Interference Various mode-order converters are implemented in optical mode multiplexing and mode switching systems. Typically, such devices can only accomplish one mode-order conversion function. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel parallel mode-order converter based on inverse-design optimization method. By using a QR-code-like silicon structure, it can realize the mode-order conversions of multiple mode channels simultaneously in a compact footprint. As a proof of concept, we design and demonstrate a dual-channel silicon mode-order converter, which converts TE0 mode to TE2 mode, and TE1 mode to TE3 mode. It has a footprint of 4 Î¼mÃ—3 Î¼m. Simulation results show that the insertion losses for the two mode-order conversion process are 0.8-1.0 dB and 0.9-1.2 dB, and have good tolerance to temperature variations. The inter-mode cross-talk is lower than -19.9 dB and -17.4 dB. Experimental results show that its range of insertion losses for the two process fluctuate within 2.0-3.6 dB and 1.5-5.1 dB in the wavelength range of 1525-1565 nm. The inter-mode cross-talk is lower than -10.7 dB and -13.1 dB, respectively."

"Relationship value benefits of membership programs, heterogeneous stakeholders and museum impact beyond fees Reward; Frequent Flyer Program; Demotion In times of decreasing public funding, cultural institutions such as museums increasingly develop new stakeholder management practices to build a different or more diversified support base. Recently, membership programs have especially been gaining popularity. In this paper, we adopt a relationship value approach to study the poorly understood behaviors of members that can benefit museums beyond membership fees. In particular, we focus on the extent to which membership level and the perceived prestige of the museum drive value co-creation through prestige leveraging. We study this by using a sample of 430 members and non-members of the Hermitage Museum in Amsterdam. We find that membership level is positively related with cross-buying behavior at the museum store and restaurant, and recommending the museum. In addition, these value creating behaviors are mediated by members leveraging the museum's prestige in their social environment. In contrast, we find a negative relationship between membership level and recruiting new members into the program, which could be explained by status dilution effects."
"Hydrothermal growing of cluster-like ZnO nanoparticles without crystal seeding on PET films via dopamine anchor Semiconductor; Field Emission; Nanotubes Growing of ZnO nanoparticles on PET films without crystal seeding has been achieved by employing polydopamine as the anchor. The PDA layer was formed on the surface of PET film by the polymerization of dopamine. The PDA-PET was dipped into zinc precursors for hydrothermal growth of ZnO nanoparticles. Cluster-like ZnO nanoparticles were obtained and the special structure was affected by the growing time and zinc ion concentration. The surface morphology, structure and properties were characterized, and the functions including antimicrobial activity and UV protection of the ZnO-coated PET film were investigated. The developed facile hydrothermal approach without seeding will benefit the development of UV resistant and antimicrobial PET films."

"Computer-modelled materials design for metal organic frameworks - ID1 (Masters Candidate: Ibrahim Orhan) Can we teach chemical intuition to an AI in order to develop novel composite porous materials such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs) for direct CO2 capture from air faster than a human could conduct the same work? As we know material and material composite discovery and formulation is a time consuming process. If human input can be minimised in the design of an experiment and analysis of its subsequent results, it is likely that optimised research outcomes can be reached faster and more efficiently. AI has traditionally been
used for single compound discoveries. What is absent is how porous materials and composites can be formed from the existing pool of knowledge and how we can teach it chemical intuition for developing new porous MOFs and composite material systems.
The Student will assist CSIRO with using AI and computerized mathematical simulations and theory such as Monte Carlo simulations to predict, model and develop new MOF and MOF-polymer composite materials for CO2 capture from air . With the aid of AI and simulations, this Project will attempt to use Machine Learning (ML) in workflows to produce MOF materials and MOF-polymer composites that are specifically tailored for engagement for a range of applications and the student will be involved in projects with real-world outcomes. This will include modelling systems and developing the AI to predict MOFs for capturing CO2 at various partial pressures and concentrations.

CO2 capture from direct air and turn that into a work plan for a specialised chemist to
produce. The Project may result in discoveries of applications in the aerospace and
defence sectors, and it will align with work being carried by CSIRO for new MOFs for
CO2 capture and CO2Gen. This Project aligns with CSIRO's industrial project

"Recycled glass technology for cost effective green buildings Recovered glass fines are considered unsuitable for glass manufacturing due to particles either being too small or contaminated with
ceramic, stoneware, Pyrex and plastic. Only 48% of the annual glass waste of 257,000 tonnes generated in Victoria is recycled for glass
manufacturing (cullet glass) and the remaining (including glass fines) ends up at stockpiles. At present, the estimated stockpile of recovered glass in Victoria exceeds 300,000 tonnes and needs an efficient approach to minimise economic, social and environmental impact due to glass wastes and to find a viable market for its reuse. The current project aims to utilise recovered glass fines using a systematic approach that includes a rigorous experimental program and verification pilot trial with a model house built and monitored. The project outcomes will be commercialised by the lead industry partner through patents/IP protection that will add significant value to glass fines through application into constructing building components."
"Isophorone-boronate ester: A simple chemosensor for optical detection of fluoride anion Luminescence; Boron; Diborane A highly selective isophorone-boronate ester based chemosensor, (1), having a dicyanovinyl moiety as a convenient colorimetric probe, has been designed. Different types of anionic analyte such as CH3COOâˆ’, ClO4 âˆ’, Clâˆ’, Fâˆ’, PF6 âˆ’, Brâˆ’ and HSO4 âˆ’ were tested and among them only highly nucleophilic Fâˆ’ anion displayed significant response towards the sensor. Addition of the fluoride anion across the boron atom disrupts the Ï€-conjugation thereby shifts the absorption wavelength towards the redshift region due to the decrease in the HOMO-LUMO energy gap and a colour change from yellow to blue is observed under visible light condition. The detection limit of this probe was calculated to be 3.25 Ã— 10â€”8 M for fluoride anion. The binding constants and the detection limits of the sensor were calculated using absorption titration studies. The silica gel TLC strips dip-coated by the chemosensor (1) revealed a colour change from yellow to brick red to naked eye."

"Pregnancy and homelessness: Women?s perspectives on
early intervention and a cross-sector forum The proposed research project aims to build evidence to inform service delivery and policy development to meet the needs of pregnant women experiencing homelessness. This project builds on previous research (Murray, Theobald & Watson, 2018) which, while noting elements of good practice, identified several key issues concerning pregnant homeless women in relation to data collection, staff training, integration of services, and the provision of specialist support and all forms of accommodation, including crisis, transitional and long term housing. This earlier research (Stage 1) involved interviews with 41 staff from 27 homelessness, health and other agencies and produced a report with 24 policy and practice recommendations. This second stage of the research, informed by the earlier stage of the research, will investigate the experiences and perspectives of pregnant, homeless women and produce a report with policy and practice recommendations. The findings, in conjunction with the findings of Stage 1, will provide the foundation for a cross-sector forum.

"WP Toxicants research: Sources, fate and transport of Microplastics in Western Port catchments (PhD Candidate: TBC) Microplastics are a ubiquitous pollutant and to mitigate microplastic pollution in the environment a better understanding of the sources, fate and transportation from land to waterways and bays are needed. This project will investigate microplastic pollution in waters and sediments across the Westernport Catchment. This research will focus on microplastics and their fate and transport in waterways across
Westernport. The project will determine the principle types and major sources of microplastic present in Westernport waterways and the Bay and how their fate and transport may be linked to local and catchment scale features, surrounding land use, environmental variables and microplastic properties.
This project directly links to one of the A3P research projects Project F5.1 Understand the impact of litter, including microplastics, on the social and ecological values of waterways and bays. The project also complements a parallel A3P PhD project that is investigating the performance of stormwater treatment wetlands for removing microplastics, including likely study wetlands in the Westernport catchment."
"The UVA response of enolic dibenzoylmethane: Beyond the static approach Density Functional Theory; Enols; Hydrogen Bonds Enolic dibenzoylmethane is used in cosmetic sunscreens as a UVA filter because it strongly absorbs radiation around 340 nm. Assessing the absorption properties solely on the basis of the vertical excitation spectrum at the minimum of the potential energy surface leads to the conclusion that the nÏ€âˆ— state is not initially photoexcited. Since this molecule exhibits large changes in structure due to nuclear thermal and quantum fluctuations, it is not sufficient to consider one molecular configuration but an ensemble of configurations. In this work, we simulate its UVA response by employing the DFT/MRCI method in conjunction with configurations sampled from density functional theory-based classical and path integral molecular dynamics as well as by computing Franck-Condon factors. Our findings indicate that thermal and nuclear quantum fluctuations symmetrically broaden the excited states' absorption within the semi-classical approximation and thus it is necessary to include vibronic effects in order to correctly reproduce the experimental spectrum. The absorption is largely dominated by the Ï€Ï€âˆ— state but there is a minor contribution from the nÏ€âˆ— state, contrary to the static result. The crossing between these two states occurs during the intramolecular proton transfer. This knowledge is of importance for studying photorelaxation mechanisms of dibenzoylmethane and other Î²-diketone compounds."
"Innovative immune-based therapies and diagnostics: using nanotechnology for personalized medicine Advances in nanomaterials are expected to enable the design of innovative vaccines, diagnostics and immunotherapies. Their effective
application however, needs a deeper understanding of the person being treated. For example, sex, age and mental health affect the immune system, and vice-versa. Using such insights to personalize immunotherapies will be vital in vulnerable populations, such as cancer patients and the elderly, since many fail to respond to current treatments or vaccines.
We will expand our leadership profile in vaccine nanotechnology, with new vaccines against cancer and malaria. Cross-disciplinary expertise into the effects of sex, aging and brain health on immunity will be deployed to personalize immunotherapies in patients with cancer, and to promote health in the elderly. At the end of the fellowship we will have tested our lead laboratory findings in multiple human trials, validating our new diagnostics, prognostics and personalized immunotherapies."

"Correlations between intestinal innate immune genes and cecal microbiota highlight potential for probiotic development for immune modulation in poultry Intestine Flora; Ruminococcaceae; Microorganisms Immune function is influenced by the diversity and stability of the intestinal microbiota. A likely trade-off of immune function for growth has been demonstrated in heavier breeds of poultry that have been genetically selected for growth and feed efficiency traits. We investigated the expression of selected innate immune genes and genes encoding products involved in intestinal barrier function to determine whether function changes could be consistently linked to the phenotypic expression of feed conversion ratio (FCR), a common measure of performance within poultry broiler flocks. In addition, we compared individual cecal microbial composition with innate immune gene expression. Samples were utilised from two replicate trials termed P1E1 and P1E2. High (n = 12) and low (n = 12) performing birds were selected based on their individual FCR data from each replicate and combined for microbiota phylogenetic composition and immune gene expression analysis. Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1La) and zonula occludens 1 (ZO1) were differentially expressed between high- and low-performing broilers. Several taxa were correlated with FCR; of these, unclassified YS2 and ZO1 were also positively correlated with each other. Interactions between taxa and differentially expressed innate immune genes between P1E1 and P1E2 were much greater compared to relationships between high- and low-performing birds. At the level of phylum, reciprocal correlations between tight junction proteins and Toll-like receptors with Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were evident, as were correlations at the genus level."

"Analyzing Wildfire Evacuation Behavior with GPS Data (60NANB20D182) (administered by University of Florida, USA) The previous e-Sanctuary project (funded by NIST, 60NANB16D282) and WUI-NITY projects (funded by NIST, 60NANB18D255) produced an integrated software platform for the simulation of WUI evacuation scenarios. This was a proof-of-concept model that demonstrates that three core sub-domains (fire progression, pedestrian movement and traffic movement) can be coupled within the same simulated environment to produce qualitative insights that are impossible to achieve when domains are considered
independently from one another. Macroscopic sub-models have been embedded to demonstrate this proof of concept; i.e., that models from different subject domains interact to exchange information to produce insights into evacuee performance that enables the identification of vulnerable locations and populations."

"LGBTQ Migrations: Life Story Narratives in the South Australian GLAM Sector (Administered by University of Adelaide) This project investigates the role gender and sexual diversity play in migration and mobility to South Australia 1950-1999 and how stories of migration can be collected and preserved. Histories in relation to interstate, international, and global migration into South Australia exist, however there is a significant need to address the lack of knowledge on, and record of, how minority sexuality and gender influenced moving to South Australia. 
Limited information prevents a full understanding of migration histories. This project works with the History Trust of South Australia to address a recognised and strategic need for greater inclusiveness of gender and sexual diversity in the context of migration."
"Accessibility and emotionality of online assessment feedback: Using emoticons to enhance student perceptions of marker competence and warmth Computer-Mediated Communication; Communication; Sentiment Assessment feedback is one of the most powerful learning tools, and in higher education this feedback is increasingly being provided online. The current study investigated the inclusion of emoticons as a method through which to enhance student perceptions of the accessibility and emotionality of written online assessment feedback. Undergraduate students (N = 241) were presented with an online faux essay along with associated written feedback typical of the comments students would receive in the higher education context. The feedback was identical except for the inclusion of emoticons. Using a between-groups design, emoticons were manipulated in two ways: frequency (none, 1, 3, or 6) and valence (happy, sad, or confused). The use of happy emoticons produced significantly higher perceptions of marker warmth when compared to no emoticons, or when negatively valenced emoticons were included. Furthermore, marker competence was significantly higher when 3 happy face emoticons were presented in the feedback than when 3 sad or confused faces were included. Student perceptions of feedback quality and marker professionalism were not affected by emoticon use. Thus, the results suggest that instructors can use positively valenced emoticons to inject some fun, warmth, and emotionality in written online assessment feedback without sacrificing feedback quality or professional integrity."

"Generative Adversarial Networks for Spatio-temporal Data: A Survey Generative; Computer Vision; Source Domain Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable success in producing realistic-looking images in the computer vision area. Recently, GAN-based techniques are shown to be promising for spatio-temporal-based applications such as trajectory prediction, events generation, and time-series data imputation. While several reviews for GANs in computer vision have been presented, no one has considered addressing the practical applications and challenges relevant to spatio-temporal data. In this article, we have conducted a comprehensive review of the recent developments of GANs for spatio-temporal data. We summarise the application of popular GAN architectures for spatio-temporal data and the common practices for evaluating the performance of spatio-temporal applications with GANs. Finally, we point out future research directions to benefit researchers in this area."

"Bring one keynote speaker to the Australian Gender Economics Workshop, Melbourne, VIC, 13-15 February 2019 The AGEW conference will demonstrate RMIT’s commitment to supporting high quality academic research to address issues of social and economic concern. Namely, RMIT aims to contribute to developing the research evidence base needed to better understand the factors that give rise to gender differentials in society and identify the policies and approaches that can be used to address gender inequalities.
The conference will also solidify RMIT’s support of the co-hosting organisation, the Women in Economics Network (WEN) which advocates for the greater representation and involvement of women in the economics profession and policymaking environment.
While many organisations in society today aspire to achieve gender equality, it is clear that barriers persist.
This accentuates the need for the research and policy community to synergistically pool together our knowledge and insights, and collectively build research-based evidence about “what works” in addressing gender inequality, and what needs to be done, and to communicate these findings publicly. Economics offers the data-driven methods and analytical tools to contribute to this evidence base. RMIT would be proud to take a leading role in this initiative through AGEW.
AGEW will also provide the environment in which researchers and policy analysts can share their insights in direct conversation with policy makers and organisational leaders, which is a critical element in the translation of research knowledge into outcomes. This aligns strongly with RMIT’s mission to foster research that is practically-oriented and will generate real-world impact for the betterment of society."

The project aims to benefit the health and well-being of Aboriginal women."
"Advancing real estate decision making: understanding known, unknown and unknowable risks Decision Making; Imprecise Probabilities; Major Accident Purpose: Whilst existing literature on real estate risk management focusses almost exclusively on holistic risk management techniques, documented increases in frequency and magnitude of unforeseen, rare and extreme events can throw up sudden, unexpected shocks that can challenge recognised real estate decision-making strategies. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: To advance real estate decision-making practice in this area, this research paper takes the skilfully conceptualised downside risk framework presented by Diebold et al. (2010), being the known (K), the unknown (u) and the unknowable (U) risk categories, to provide a blueprint for effective real estate decision making in a changing global environment. Findings: In recording categories of risk, managing uncertainty can be achieved by an interrelated approach of adaption, robustness and resilience. This is important part of a real estate managerâ€™s decision-making toolkit as risk recognition and knowledge of KuU event categories can augment an effective management strategy. Originality/value: The mastery of modern real estate risk management can be better served by understanding and managing extreme downside risk events. Creating a comprehensive risk management framework can enhance comparative real estate performance whereby unprepared competitors fail in a world increasingly affected by large, highly improbable and unpredictable events."

IABEs play a critical economic and a social role in Australia. Yet, many IABEs are nascent, needing more innovative ways to nurture effective management styles. This event is critical for new knowledge development by key stakeholder participation and insights on how IABEs perceive and take on business risks and develop meaningful partnerships. Consequently, the event will be an avenue for informing policy making around IABE business investment and governance capability development. It is aligned with RMIT's Strategic goals related to Diversity and achieving community impact."
"Marine biofouling program The current proposal aims to extend biofouling monitoring for the 2018-2019 financial year and assess periodically the biofouling community including the range of pests that may occur during this time. The seasonal project will remove all biofouling material from newly installed settlement plates, and using DNA and PCR-based next generation sequencing methodologies, taxonomically identify the community structure. The project will provide information on the extent of established marine pests and the potential of new nationally listed marine pest incursions. "
"Resilience Shift ? resilience primers for industry (administered by Resilient Organisations) This contract is specifically for developing a primer for the water utilities and providers, focusing on potable water."
"Developing appropriate protocols for naming future fuels This project will undertake a systematic collection of actual and proposed commercial names being used for current and future energy sources in the countries with active hydrogen development programs (as identified by the RP1 research team). Energy sources include: gas; hydrogen, biofuels, synthetic gas, methane, nuclear, and electricity (renewable and coal generated). It will review Australian regulation on product naming conventions to crystallise any limits which might exist or emerge towards naming singular and blended products for domestic use and commercial export. 
Based on the above, suggest naming strategies for future fuels, specifically hydrogen. "

"Nanoengineered catalysts for valorisation of waste derived pyrolysis oil (administered by UQld) The Project aims to address critical issues of waste conversion into diesel-range fuels. Waste contains complex chemical compounds and upon exposure to heat, forms light gases and solid char and poor-quality liquid. This project will develop nanoengineered catalysts to control the chemical transformation of waste vapours into desired compounds which can be upgraded into diesel at Southern Oil Refinery. The project will exploit modern spectroscopic and computational tools for catalyst design to elucidate catalytic active sites and identify efficient pathways for carbon chain growth. The technology will divert waste from landfills and establish advanced waste refinery in 
 Australia leading to job growth in renewable fuel manufacturing sector. "
