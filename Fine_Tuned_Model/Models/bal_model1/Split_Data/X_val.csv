"Comprehensive Resilience Assessment of Complex Urban Public Spaces: A Perspective of Promoting Sustainability Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Complex urban systems, such as multi-floor rail transit stations and integrated railway transport hubs, are termed â€œcomplex urban public spacesâ€ (CUPSs). These CUPSs facilitate peopleâ€™s lives, but, at the same time, are threatened by various risks due to their multi-floor structure, dense crowds, high correlation in multi-function, complex facilities, and space openness. The risk events of CUPSs could have a negative influence on public safety and further influence sustainable development. Increasing the resilience of CUPSs is an effective way to respond to risks and guarantee public safety. Therefore, it is necessary to first assess the resilience of CUPSs. In this paper, a six-level comprehensive resilience indicator system was established based on aspects of the essence of resilience. Used in combination with the methods of resilience impact score and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process, the resilience value could be calculated. The Shenzhen North Railway Station (SZ) and the Guangzhou South Railway Station (GZ) were used to validate the proposed methodology. The established resilience indicator system was shown to be comprehensive and innovative, and, regarding practicality, the proposed assessment methodology is convenient to use. This research can help policymakers to assess the resilience of CUPSs and develop relevant policies to improve the resilience of buildings, which can further enhance urban sustainability."
"Globalisation, Populism and humanitarian Sensibility in Australia In the context of increased Globalisation, national boundaries are becoming less important in terms of trade and investment and movement of people. This potentially creates anxieties and insecurities about national identity. There has been a rise in nationalist populism in Australia in the last five years, with increased focus on migration and border protection and a fear of international terrorism. Further the growth of anti‐Muslim and anti‐Islam nationalist sentiment and a reassertion of Australian cultural identity that focuses on social cohesion.
This projects involves RMIT conducting a Literature Review, Analysis of Australian Mainstream Digital and Print Media, Analysis of Australian Broadcast News and Current Affairs, Qualitative Interviews and surveys to produce a final report that addresses the aims of the project. The data produces would also be used in academic publications."
"Comparative Flower Transcriptome Network Analysis Reveals DEGs Involved in Chickpea Reproductive Success during Salinity Cicer; Ascochyta; Genetic Variability Salinity is increasingly becoming a significant problem for the most important yet intrinsically salt-sensitive grain legume chickpea. Chickpea is extremely sensitive to salinity during the reproductive phase. Therefore, it is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms by comparing the transcriptomic dynamics between the two contrasting genotypes in response to salt stress. Chickpea exhibits considerable genetic variation amongst improved cultivars, which show better yields in saline conditions but still need to be enhanced for sustainable crop production. Based on previous extensive multi-location physiological screening, two identified genotypes, JG11 (salt-tolerant) and ICCV2 (salt-sensitive), were subjected to salt stress to evaluate their phenological and transcriptional responses. RNA-Sequencing is a revolutionary tool that allows for comprehensive transcriptome profiling to identify genes and alleles associated with stress tolerance and sensitivity. After the first flowering, the whole flower from stress-tolerant and sensitive genotypes was collected. A total of ~300 million RNA-Seq reads were sequenced, resulting in 2022 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to salt stress. Genes involved in flowering time such as FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and pollen development such as ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS), rho-GTPase, and pollen-receptor kinase were significantly differentially regulated, suggesting their role in salt tolerance. In addition to this, we identify a suite of essential genes such as MYB proteins, MADS-box, and chloride ion channel genes, which are crucial regulators of transcriptional responses to salinity tolerance. The gene set enrichment analysis and functional annotation of these genes in flower development suggest that they can be potential candidates for chickpea crop improvement for salt tolerance."
"Construction of adsorbents with graphene and its derivatives for wastewater treatment: a review Adsorbents; Graphene Oxide; Adsorption Graphene and its derivatives have captured enormous attention in the design and fabrication of graphene-based adsorbents to handle various water pollutants due to their huge specific surface area, unique two-dimensional structure, intriguing surface properties, tailorable microstructure, ease of being functionalized/modified, and good processibility for integration with other organic and inorganic species. However, many challenges remain for this topic that are undergoing intense study. For example, the specific role of the graphene component in the adsorption process is not evidenced in many existing reports, although there have been some speculations. Moreover, the high cost and environmental safety issues of graphene materials derived from graphite by the popular modified Hummers' method are not well addressed. These challenges bring about an ambiguous development trend in using graphene and its derivatives to construct next-generation adsorbents. Herein, we present a timely, up-to-date overview and perspectives to summarize the recent development of adsorbents constructed with graphene and its derivatives. We first discuss different kinds of graphene-based adsorbents (e.g., intrinsic, doped, modified/functionalized, composited, and a combination thereof). We then categorize the adsorbates, compliant to graphene-based adsorbents, into contaminants with various charge states, different water solubilities and complexity, emerging contaminants, and others. Further, multifunctional applications, trace contaminant treatment, and adsorption mechanism analysis are sequentially presented for graphene-based adsorbents. Finally, after summarizing the development of graphene-based adsorbents using graphene oxide as a typical starting material, we provide the current challenges and future perspectives for the rational design and fabrication of active, durable, and economical adsorbents constructed with graphene and its derivatives."

"Cumulative Impacts of Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: Experimental Evidence from Indonesia Child Labor; Family Characteristic; School Attendance Conditional cash transfers provide income and promote human capital investments. Yet evaluating their longitudinal impacts is hard, as most experimental evaluations treat control locations after a few years. We examine such impacts in Indonesia after six years, where the program rollout left the experiment largely intact. We find static effects on many targeted indicators: childbirth using trained professionals increased dramatically, and under- 15 children not in school fell by half. We observe impacts requiring cumulative investments: stunting fell by 23 percent. While human capital accumulation increased, the transfers did not lead to transformative economic change for recipient households. (JEL I21, I38, J13, J24, O15)"

"Reporting of Corporate Social Responsibility in Central Public Sector Enterprises: A Study of Post Mandatory Regime in India Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative This paper explores the level of corporate social responsibility (CSR) contributions disclosed by central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) in India. This paper analyses the nature and quality of CSR disclosures (CSRDs) made by CPSEs listed in India following the issue of CSR guidelines by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) for CPSEs in March 2010. The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of CSR guidelines on the reporting practices of the CPSEs. A content analysis of annual reports across seven themes shows that Human Resources (HR) and Community Development are the prime focus areas of CSR disclosures, whereas Carbon and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are the least reported activity. The disclosures across all CSR themes are primarily narrative rather than quantitative or in monetary terms. The findings of the study may help policy makers in India to assess practices and devise detailed and specific CSRD requirements, rather than the current general mandatory requirements, to enhance the performance and quality of CSRDs by the CPSEs."

"Municipal solid waste management practices and challenges in the southeastern coastal cities of Sri Lanka Family Characteristic; Solid Waste Management; Cardboard Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) has become a major challenge in Sri Lanka for post-conflict development activities. Many urban areas are facing severe problems in managing 10 to 50 metric tons of waste per day. However, limited research has been carried out to identify the key issues and policy gaps in MSWM. This research studies the existing complexities of MSWM processes, practices, and emerging challenges in three highly congested urban areas in the south-eastern coast of Sri Lanka. A mixed method strategy using field observations, semi-structured interviews and secondary data sources was employed for the data collection. The study revealed that, although the MSWM systems in the urban areas include all necessary elements, their effectiveness and efficiency are not satisfactory due to poor or non-segregation of waste at the source of generation; lack of resources; absence of regulation to reduce waste generation and control polluters; absence of regular collection schedule; and lack of technical know-how and initiatives. The recommendations drawn from the study include feasible solutions and immediate measures required to improve the MSWM before the related environmental and public health problems become a social catastrophe. The recommendations will also greatly contribute in the achievement of developing sustainable cities."

"World city futures: The role of urban and regional policies in the Asia Pacific region Hukou; China; Land Development This chapter addresses six major policy issues that confront planners concerned with placing their cities in the top rank of the world hierarchy: spatial organization, regional governance, social and environmental sustainability, migrant workers, the rise of civil society, and intercity networks. It reviews the geography of global capitalism, because the â€˜regional levelâ€™ to which A. J. Scott refers is precisely the level of world city formation. The chief sources of demographic growth for the mega-city regions come from rural migration and international migration, though Asian world cities are beginning to experience international migration as well. Rural households in world city regions are tightly integrated with an urban economy that is grounded in manufacturing and business services. The hyper-urbanizing cities of Asia are thus drawing on the so-called surplus population of rural and small town areas within their own country, although migrant workers are beginning to arrive in larger numbers also from abroad."
"Contingent Effect of Board Gender Diversity on Performance in Emerging Markets: Evidence from the Egyptian Revolution Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence The 2011 Egyptian revolution was associated with significant political and social upheaval, followed by societal changes and attempts by policymakers to reduce the marginalisation of women and promote their inclusion in the economy. Drawing on this background, the authors compare the effect of board gender diversity before and after the revolution. Results indicate that gender diversity in corporate boards is coupled with improvements in firm performance in the immediate post revolution phase. This evidence provides insights into the contextual factors related to diversity and performance relationship and supporting arguments for regulatory changes to further encourage womenâ€™s representation on boards."
"Bamboo as an alternative bioenergy crop and powerful ally for land restoration in Indonesia Culms; Phyllostachys Edulis; Plantation The energy demand in Indonesia has increased significantly with its population growth, urbanization, and economic development. The growing concern of meeting energy demand while reducing dependency on fossil fuels has resulted in an increasing demand for renewable energy. As a country with a rich biomass base, bioenergy is now an important component of Indonesia's energy agenda. However, a crucial problem in bioenergy production is the selection of species that can provide a sustainable supply of feedstock without having an impact on food security and the environment. In this context, we discuss the characteristics and benefits of using bamboo, a perennial grass, as a potential species for bioenergy feedstock in Indonesia. We describe the fuel characteristics of bamboo along with the possibility to align its cultivation, production, and usage with environmental and developmental agendas which makes it a suitable bioenergy crop in the country. In addition, its ability to grow on degraded lands, fast growth, long root system, and easy maintenance prove it as a powerful ally for the restoration of degraded land. We recommend in-depth research on the social, ecological, and economic feasibility of using this species for bioenergy production."

"Localisation of the Sustainable Development Goals in an emerging nation Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), agreed to by all member countries of the United Nations, require urgent action on the world's most pressing problems. Success requires bottom-up participation of local stakeholders. This case study of Timor-Lesteâ€”a fledgling, fossil fuel-supported economyâ€”maps the awareness and commitment of grassroots stakeholders to the SDGs and the roadblocks to localisation. Guiding this paper is Habermasâ€™ view of societal evolution and communicative action, which aids analysing the socio-political and structural dynamics affecting SDGs localisation in a developing nation. This study reveals stakeholder inability to articulate a clear vision for the SDGs, lack of human capital and funds, a weak public-administrative system, strong socio-political nuances, and poor governance infrastructure to support multi-stakeholder relationships. This paper provides insights for developing a more nuanced and robust public intervention to support local stakeholders that will enable knowledge, cultural and communication transformations required for successful SDGs localisation."

"The effect of maritime knowledge clusters on maritime firms’ performance: An organizational learning perspective Alliance Portfolios; Firm; Open Innovation Maritime Knowledge Clusters are known to facilitate regional economic growth. Nevertheless, few studies have been conducted to examine their impact on maritime firmsâ€™ performance. Drawing on organizational learning theory, this study investigates the effect of maritime knowledge clusters on the constituent maritime firmsâ€™ performance. A conceptual model was proposed and examined using survey data collected from shipping professionals in Singapore. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were employed as the data analysis approach. The results show that the positive relationship between maritime knowledge clusters and maritime firmsâ€™ performance is fully mediated by the firmsâ€™ social capital and absorptive capacity in a sequential manner. This indicates that maritime firms should focus on strengthening not only their social capital but also absorptive capacity so as to fully enjoy the benefits brought about by maritime knowledge clusters. In addition, regulators should endeavor to develop global linkage, global systemic mechanisms and local knowledge clusters to facilitate organizational learning of the constituent maritime firms."

"Losing the authority–what institutional architecture for cooperative governance in the Murray Darling Basin? Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Water governance strongly depends on the institutional arrangements in place. The plethora of recent inquiries into the adequacy and integrity of governance arrangements in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) indicates a crisis of trust, legitimacy and public confidenceâ€“in short, a loss of authority. With the prospect that current arrangements are losing the authority and legitimacy needed to govern the Basin, pressure is mounting for further reforms due to scandals exposed in the media throughout 2017 and 2018. These and subsequent inquiries have revealed serious concerns about probity, integrity, maladministration and the adequacy of compliance and enforcement regimes. The productive potential of this crisis is that draws attention to the need for reforms to governance institutions. This paper aims to explore the redesign of the institutional architecture in the MDB. Given the profound challenges of social and climate change that are demanding reconsideration of the underlying models used in adaptively governing large complex socio-ecological systems, the paper asks what arrangements are suited to the challenges of governing the Basin in the 21st century? This paper explores the nature of the redesign challenge, exploring principles, practices and features of MDB governance. The need for institutions with capacity for strategic navigation, goal seeking and the cultural co-construction of authority are suggested in the interests of cultivating debate about prospective reorganisation."
"Factors influencing intention to adopt ICT among intensive shrimp farmers Shrimp Culture; Farmers; Aquaculture Intensive shrimp production has been considered one way to increase output quantity. However, many factors need to be considered to maintain product quality, sustained practice, and environmental compliance. The adoption of monitoring technologies in shrimp farming such as monitoring important water quality parameters including temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and salinity, offers several benefits, including increasing farming processes and cost efficiency and reducing harmful environmental impacts. A sampled survey dataset comprising 184 shrimp farmers from Ca Mau, Kien Giang, and Soc Trang provinces in Vietnam, one of the world largest shrimp producers, was used to examine factors that affect farmers' adoption of aquaculture information and communication technologies (ICT). The study empirically tested an adoption model using technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior under perceived production risks. Results suggest that farmers who both perceive the ICT as being useful in their shrimp farms and are influenced by other important peers are more likely to adopt aquaculture technologies. Farmers who feel confident to learn a new technology are likely to find the technology easier to use than someone who is not as confident. Due to the inherent risky nature of intensive shrimp production, even if Vietnamese shrimp farmers perceive a high level of technology-adoption risk, they still feel more confident towards learning to use a new ICT and its usefulness, and are therefore likely to increase their adoption. The study's results suggest ICT service providers should collaborate with local aquaculture departments to develop pilot farms to showcase new aquaculture technologies and demonstrate key features and their compatibility with existing farms' infrastructure, which will consequently entice farmers to quickly adopt shrimp monitoring technologies."
"Criminal record checking and employment: The importance of policy and proximity Criminal Record; Hiring Decisions; Applicant Employment is essential to the rehabilitation of offenders, yet employers routinely check criminal records and rely on them to deny offenders employment. To manage these practices many jurisdictions use spent conviction and anti-discrimination schemes; there have also been recent campaigns aimed at â€˜banning the boxâ€™, requiring that questions about criminal record are deferred to a later point when the person could address them in interview. This article draws on findings from surveys and interviews with human resources personnel about their criminal record checking practices to identify some key concerns of employers and highlight areas for challenging employer practices. The study highlights the influence on employment decisions of external factors â€“ legislation, government policy and industry regulation â€“ and of internal considerations about proximity of the decision maker to the applicant and potential proximity to other staff. The willingness of some employers to engage with applicants opens up the possibilities for people with a criminal record to demonstrate their readiness to desist from offending and to counter stereotypes about offenders. Where there is no scope for, or willingness to attempt, such discretionary engagement, however, it is likely that employers will prioritize a risk-averse approach to employment, pre-emptively excluding potentially productive employees, and putting such ex-offenders at risk of deeper exclusion."
"The intercalation of nanoscale lattices into micro-sized graphene oxide sheets for enhancing pressure-driven desalination performances Graphene Oxide; Nanofiltration Membranes; Graphite Graphene oxide based nanofiltration membranes (GONMs) have attracted tremendous attention for water purification applications given their excellent mechanical properties and tunable inter-layer distance spacing (D-spacing). However, the desalination performance is significantly degraded in the pressure-driven filtration. In this work, we find that the pressure-driven water desalination properties are nanochannel spacing and length dependent, in which the cation-Ï€ interaction possibly plays a critical factor in the desalination procedure. Through the demonstration of surface weak-reduction and membrane thickness tuning, the D-spacing and molecule transport route length of GONMs are identified to affect the quality and quantity of cation-Ï€ interaction, respectively, which are innovatively regulated by the intercalation of nano-sized lattices into large GO sheets. As a result, the regulated membrane improves the rejection rates of MgCl2, NaCl, MgSO4 and Na2SO4 up to 41.10%, 64.14%, 84.62% and 93.19%, respectively, compared to unregulated counterparts of 13.72%, 15.93%, 34.58% and 40.99%, respectively. In addition, the regulated membrane also exhibits excellent removal efficiency of >93% against tested dyes with different molecular weight and surface charge properties. We consider that our approach could lead to the development of a powerful GONMs based platform for future water treatment."
"Population- and sex-specific sensitivity of the marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa to metal exposure Gammarus Fossarum; Potamopyrgus Antipodarum; Bioassay The sensitivity to contaminants of natural populations varies greatly depending on their historical exposure and on the sex of the individual. These factors result in great uncertainty in ecotoxicological risk assessments and challenge the protection of marine biodiversity. This study investigated the role of background pollution in the environment in shaping the sensitivity of males and females of the common marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa to the common trace marine pollutant, copper (Cu). Female and male amphipods were collected from two sites: Geelong (the polluted site) and Clifton Springs (the clean site). Amphipods were exposed to Cu treatments of 0, 50, 100, and 250 Î¼g/L for 10 days, followed by a 10-day recovery period. Cu-exposed males from Geelong showed a reduction in feeding rate at a higher Cu concentration than males from Clifton Springs, suggesting that they have a higher tolerance to Cu than males from Clifton Springs. This can be explained by their higher base level of metallothioneins (MTs) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), the key physiological responses for detoxification and defence against damages from Cu toxicity. Males showed a higher tolerance to Cu than females. This pattern was similar in both populations, which may be associated with a higher level of GST. During the recovery period, only males from Geelong fully recovered to the control level. Our results emphasize the importance of considering population- and sex-specific sensitivity of invertebrates to contaminants in ecotoxicological risk assessments."
"Impact of microalgae species and solution salinity on algal treatment of wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Six common microalgal species, including freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus abundans, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Coelastrum microporum, and marine microalgae Nannochloropsis salina and Dunaliella tertiolecta, were tested in batch treatment to identify the most promising species for remediating a municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC). Selected species were then studied at different ROC salinity levels (5, 10, and 15 g TDS/L) in semi-continuous treatment to evaluate their potential for nutrient remediation, and biogas production through anaerobic digestion. S. abundans, C. vulgaris, and N. salina showed higher potential for growth and nutrient remediation under salinity stress. Further tests revealed that N. salina adapted well to ROC conditions, and S. abundans could grow better and had higher tolerance to the elevated salinity than C. vulgaris. S. abundans and N. salina performed better for removing nutrients and organic matter (11.5â€“18 mg/L/d TN, 7.1â€“8.2 mg/L/d TP, and 8.6â€“12.4 mg/L/d DOC). Increasing salinity led to growth inhibition and N uptake reduction for freshwater species but had no significant effect on TP removal. Biochemical methane potential tests showed the algal biomass produced a significant amount of methane (e.g., up to 422 mL CH4/g VS for N. salina), suggesting the algae generated from the ROC treatment could produce significant amounts of energy through anaerobic digestion without the need for pretreatment. This study showed the environmental and economic potential of the algal system for future applications."

"""The Global Marketing Conference""  Tokyo 26th-29th July 2018 Despite the growing interest in understanding the determinants of subjective wellbeing, significant gaps remain in the literature. One such gap concerns the understanding of the effects of social integration and/or social inclusion on wellbeing, specifically the role played by interactions with one’s neighbours and the important factor of belongingness. Using data from the Community Life Survey, this study examines the relationship between social integration and subjective wellbeing. We measure social integration along dimensions that have not been explored in the existing literature, including frequency of interaction with one’s neighbours, perceived strength of belonging to one’s immediate neighbourhood and country, length of residence in a neighbourhood, and trust in neighbours. We find that social integration is associated with higher levels of subjective wellbeing. Specifically, we find that higher levels of interaction with one’s neighbours (beyond simply saying “hello”) enhance wellbeing and the greater the frequency of these interactions, the greater the sense of wellbeing that they generate. High levels of perceived belonging, as measured by period of residence in the neighbourhood and a sense of belonging to the neighbourhood and to the country, generate positive wellbeing. Finally, results show that trust in others in the neighbourhood also generates positive wellbeing.

"Trial of liquid biosolids injection at South East Water’s
Longwarry water recycling plant (Administered by University of Newcastle). Building on previous collaborative research conducted in the field of
groundwater, and discussions arising between the University and RMIT initiated
at a forum on biosolids liquid injection in 2019, the University proposes to work
with the RMIT to conduct a targeted research project to investigate the
groundwater quality effects and future learnings from a trial of liquid biosolids
injection at South East Water’s Longwarry water recycling plant.
Through targeted data analysis, the project will seek to address two outstanding
questions:
1. What are the major groundwater quality effects of liquid injection of biosolids
at the Longwarry Water Recycling Plant, and how have these developed since
the trial in 2018?
2. What are the learnings which can be gained from this trial for future biosolids
liquid injection schemes – such as relevant water quality indicators to monitor
and assess?
To address these questions, RMIT will conduct analysis of data collected at a
series of purpose-constructed piezometers at the Longwarry Water Recycling
Plant. These samples have been collected and analysed since December 2018
and indicate changes in the concentrations of nutrients, metals and other key
groundwater characteristics following the liquid injection trial.
RMIT will (with advice from the University) analyse these data using a range of
statistical, analytical and graphical techniques in order to understand the main
controls responsible for changes in groundwater quality at the site (both factors
related to the liquid injection trial and other un-related factors).
These data and interpretations will be summarised in a report which will be
drafted for review by South East Water, and then delivered at the conclusion of
the project."
"Building resilient alpine environments with less snow (Administered by Deakin) In this project, we aim to build resilience into alpine National Parks and Alpine Resorts to counter the effects of ongoing declines in snow. Alpine environments depend on snow to regulate water flows, insulate vegetation, control soil erosion and promote proper ecosystem functioning. How these processes will operate in a snow-free future is unknown. We will determine how and where snow characteristics drive soil water availability for plants and which plant species have the best adaptation and regeneration potential under extreme
conditions such as heat, frost and drought."
"Presence and characterization of microplastics in fish of commercial importance from the Biobío region in central Chile Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter In this study we have identified and characterized microplastic particles (MPs) found in six fish species of commercial importance in central Chile. The fish species belong to different trophic levels and were obtained from the oceanic and coastal habitats. To analyze MPs, the fish gastrointestinal content was extracted, analyzed and characterized using a microscopy equipped with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The MPs found in fish samples were mainly constituted by red microfibers (70â€“100%) with sizes ranging between 176 and 2842 Î¼m. Polyester, polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were identified as the prevalent polymers detected. The coastal species showed the presence of microfibers with a higher size and abundance (71%) compared to oceanic species (29%), suggesting there is a greater exposure risk. These findings are consistent with results found in other investigations worldwide. However, further research is still needed to accurately establish the potential exposure risk for the public consuming these fish and the impact of MPs in the Chilean fishery activities."
"Investigation of Bamboo Fibrous Tensile Strength Using Modified Weibull Distribution Mechanical Properties; Sisal; Coir Ethiopia has a large coverage of bamboo plants that are used for furniture making and house building. So far, researchers have not studied the strength of Ethiopian bamboo fibers, which are utilized for composite applications. The current study measured the strength of bamboo fibers based on various testing lengths and calculated the predictive tensile strength using a modified Weibull distribution. Moreover, the quality of the extraction machine is evaluated based on shape and sensitivity parameters. This research paper incorporates the coefficient of variation of the fiber diameters, considering the defects distribution through the length for measuring the predictive strength of the fibers. The fiber diameters were calculated using the area weight methods, which had its density measured using a Pycnometer. It has been examined that as the testing gauge length and coefficient variation of fiber diameter simultaneously increased, the tensile strength of the bamboo fibers decreased. The shape parameter, sensitivity parameter, and characteristic strength of Injibara bamboo (Y. alpina) are 6.02â€“7.83, 0.63, and 459â€“642 MPa, whereas Kombolcha bamboo (B. oldhamii) are 5.87â€“10.21, 0.33, and 408â€“638 MPa, as well as Mekaneselam bamboo (Y. alpina) are 5.86â€“9.63, 0.33 and 488â€“597 MPa, respectively."

"The Incomes of Visual Artists: Which Artists, What Income? Artist; Cultural Economy; Creative Arts We review a body of literature that addresses the incomes of visual artists and their participation in the labour market. It is clear that the level and composition of visual artistsâ€™ incomes varies widely, as does their engagement in different forms of employment. The lack of a consistent definition of an artist and a lack of consistency in income sources included in current data collection presents challenges for researchers. The focus of our research is on the economic status of visual artists in Australia, and we identify a number of considerations that might inform policy responses to their financial position."
"On being posthuman in human spaces: critical posthumanist social work with interspecies families Animal Assisted Therapy; Service Dogs; Animals Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes a critical posthumanist orientation to social work as an approach to address the impediments to care experienced by interspecies families. Secondly, it challenges the anthropocentric assumptions that underpin this exclusion of nonhuman family members in human services disciplines such as social work. Design/methodology/approach: This article presents primary data from a qualitative study into social work and other human services practice in the family violence and homelessness sectors in the state of Victoria, Australia. Findings: Social workers undertook companion animal-inclusive practice to counter vulnerability to interspecies families caused by gender- and species-based violence, and by homelessness. Gender- and species-based violence was exacerbated by a lack of refuge options, and contributed to women considering their companion animals to be their children. The vulnerability that homelessness brought upon interspecies families was amplified by stigma within and external to social work and related professions, and the impediment that experiences of homelessness had on being able to provide care for their nonhuman family members. These factors shaped practice with interspecies families. Scope for future practice was also identified. Research limitations/implications: The research findings can be used to inform policy change that includes consideration of nonhuman family members, as well as critical posthuman program design in social work education. Originality/value: Companion animal-inclusive practice with interspecies families in social work is an under researched area, and there is little empirical data available on the nature of this work in Australia. This paper addresses this gap by centring social workers' own accounts of practice. This paper has scope to contribute to education in social work and other welfare fields, with the potential to empower students to challenge assumptions about social work being solely focused on human-centred concerns."
"Adverse shocks, household expenditure and child marriage: evidence from India and Vietnam Early Marriage; Legal Age; Africa South Of The Sahara Child marriage is associated with negative outcomes in regard to education, health and economic empowerment in later life. While the consequences of child marriage have been studied extensively, there has been limited discussion on the drivers of child marriage. This paper examines the impact of adverse shocks on child marriage. We use a sample of 886 girls between 12 and 18 years of age from India and Vietnam involved in the Young Lives project. The potential endogeneity problem is addressed by using rainfall deviation as the instrument. We find that in Vietnam, where bride price payment is a common practice in the event of expenditure reduction resulting from adverse shocks, a household may consider marrying off their daughter as a possible coping strategy. In contrast, in India where dowry payments are common, shocks may reduce the probability of child marriage, possibly, because a girlâ€™s family is unable to meet the dowry requirements. These findings are robust to alternative ways of measuring child marriage, expenditure and rainfall deviation. We recommend that policies designed to reduce child marriage are considered in the context of cultural and social norms."
"A practical approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from open dumps through infrastructure restructuring: A case study in Nanjing City, China Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste A new environmental ban has forced the restructure of open dumps in China since 1 July 2011. A technical process was established in this study that is feasible for the upgrade of open dumps through restructuring. The feasibility of restructuring and the benefit of greenhouse gas emission reductions were assessed according to field surveys of five landfills and four dumps in Nanjing. The results showed that the daily processing capacities of the existing landfills have been unable to meet the growth of municipal solid waste (MSW), making restructuring of the landfills imperative. According to an assessment of the technical process, only four sites in Nanjing were suitable for upgrading. Restructuring the Jiaozishan landfill effectively reduced the leachate generation rate by 5.84% under its scale when expanded by 60.7% in 2015. CO2 emissions were reduced by approximately 55,000-86,000 tons per year, in which biogas power generation replaced fossil fuels Fossil fuels accounted for the largest proportion, up to 45,000-60,000 tons. Photovoltaic power generation on the overlying land has not only reduced CO2 emissions to 26,000-30,000 tons per year but has also brought in continuing income from the sale of electricity. The funds are essential for developing countries such as China, which lack long-term financial support for landfill management after closure."
"Enhancing greywater treatment via MHz-Order surface acoustic waves Surface Acoustic Wave; Droplet; Interdigital Transducers There is a pressing need for efficient biological treatment systems for the removal of organic compounds in greywater given the rapid increase in household wastewater produced as a consequence of rapid urbanisation. Moreover, proper treatment of greywater allows its reuse that can significantly reduce the demand for freshwater supplies. Herein, we demonstrate the possibility of enhancing the removal efficiency of solid contaminants from greywater using MHz-order surface acoustic waves (SAWs). A key distinction of the use of these high frequency surface acoustic waves, compared to previous work on its lower frequency (kHz order) bulk ultrasound counterpart for wastewater treatment, is the absence of cavitation, which can inflict considerable damage on bacteria, thus limiting the intensity and duration, and hence the efficiency enhancement, associated with the acoustic exposure. In particular, we show that up to fivefold improvement in the removal efficiency can be obtained, primarily due to the ability of the acoustic pressure field in homogenizing and reducing the size of bacterial clusters in the sample, therefore providing a larger surface area that promotes greater bacteria digestion. Alternatively, the SAW exposure allows the reduction in the treatment duration to achieve a given level of removal efficiency, thus facilitating higher treatment rates and hence processing throughput. Given the low-cost of the miniature chipscale platform, these promising results highlight its possibility for portable greywater treatment for domestic use or for large-scale industrial wastewater processing through massive parallelization."
"Policing technology-facilitated sexual violence against adult victims: police and service sector perspectives Hacker; Cybercrime; Computer Security To date, the majority of attention to technology-facilitated sexual violence (TFSV) in both policy and practice has been on child sexual exploitation and abuse. Far less attention has been paid to digital sexualised violence against adult members of the population. The aim of this paper is to examine police responses to these serious and emerging harms, which we identify as including the following: (1) online sexual harassment; (2) gender and sexuality-based harassment; (3) cyberstalking; (4) image-based sexual exploitation (including â€˜revenge pornographyâ€™); and (5) the use of communications technologies to coerce a victim into an unwanted sexual act. While these are variously criminal offences, unlawful civil behaviours or not subject to criminal or civil sanctions or remedies, we claim in this paper that they exist on a continuum of violence and yet the â€˜realâ€™ harms of TFSV are frequently minimised in practice. Drawing on 30 stakeholder interviews with police, legal services and domestic and sexual violence service sector providers, we explore the issues, challenges and promises of law enforcement in this area. We argue that greater attention must be paid to recognising the serious harms of digital abuse and harassment; the role of criminal law in responding to these behaviours; and the importance of investing in police resources to adequately tackle these growing behaviours in a constantly shifting and amorphous digital era."
"South Asia's power generation and cross-border power trading Ganges River; Bangladesh; Road Traffic Noise South Asia makes up nearly one quarter of the world's population. Yet its per capita yearly electric power consumption is the 2nd lowest (just above the Sub Saharan Africa) compared to any regions and sub regions in the world. Access to power and meagre per capita consumption make South Asia one of the poorest regions in the world based on economic and human development indices. Limited indigenous energy resources of individual nations in South Asia are not enough to generate adequate power for rapid industrialization, economic and social development. Moreover, the availability of limited indigenous energy resources varies among South Asian nations. The power demand and supply also differ due to seasonal variability. With rapidly rising power demand in all South Asian countries, there are opportunities for cooperation and optimization of available generated power through cross-border power trade. This paper reviews power present generation in South Asia and highlights the potential for cross border power trade to boast regional economic development and prosperity."
"The application of Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus as a bioaugmentation agent for the enhanced treatment of non-sterile fish wastewater Activated Sludge; Batch Reactors; Salinity Wastewaters generated by fish processing are characterised by salt concentrations similar to or greater than that of seawater together with high nutrient concentrations (e.g. organic carbon and total nitrogen) due to the presence of blood, oil, and fish tissues. Fish processing wastewater entering rivers and oceans have become a key factor leading to the pollution of receiving waters; the adequate treatment of this wastewater is, therefore, crucial to a sustainable fish industry. The present study aimed to determine whether augmentation of fish wastewater with either Marinirhabdus sp., Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus or a consortium of the two halobacteria, could successfully enhance the removal of both chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) from fish wastewater. Following 9 days of incubation, the bioaugmentation treatment resulted in a significant reduction in COD, 88%, 91%, and 92% in fish wastewater augmented with either Marinirhabdus sp., Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus respectively, or a consortium of the two halobacteria compared with the control (non-bioaugmented) treatment (77% removal). In tall bioaugmentation treatments (79â€“88%) TN removal was also significantly greater than the control treatment (57%). After 9 days of incubation, the COD and TN in bioaugmentation reached the European Union's (EU) wastewater discharge standard (Level B, COD < 120 mg Lâˆ’1, TN < 70 mg Lâˆ’1). The addition of monoculture was effective in enhancing the removal of COD, while co-culture significantly improved TN removal. Results of 16S rDNA sequence analysis investigating the survival of these introduced bacteria showed that only Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus was detected at the end of the treatment, constituting 36% of the total bacterial population when added alone to the wastewater. This study confirms the effectiveness of bioaugmentation in removing COD and TN in saline fish wastewater. The ability of Marinobacter hydrocarbonclasticus to enhance the treatment and dominate the bacterial community suggests the commercial potential of this organism for bioaugmentation of aquaculture wastewater without the need for further bioaugmentation."
"Reducing GHG emissions and treating contaminants using own resources: A new lookout for water industries Biogas and biosolids are the two most valuable products generated from the treatment of wastewater. Biogas is used for energy generation while biosolids are beneficiated for agriculture land application. The presence of emerging contaminants such as PFAS and micro-plastics in biosolids poses some serious concerns about their land applications. In today?s carbon constrained world, the greenhouse gas emissions from biogas combustion may not be acceptable. Water industries are constantly searching for cost-effective solutions to deal with emerging contaminants and reduce their carbon emissions. From the preliminary work conducted by the current PhD student under the supervision of A/Prof Kalpit Shah, it has been successfully demonstrated that biosolids and biogas can be converted into hydrogen and carbon nanomaterials. Hydrogen can be used for clean energy generation while carbon nanomaterials can be used for removing PFAS and other contaminants from the wastewater stream. The current proposal provides cost-effective alternative that can deal with emerging contaminants and reduce carbon emissions issues in an integrated manner."

"Case Studies in Initial Sizing for Hybrid-Electric General Aviation Aircraft Helicopter; Air Mobility; Propellers This paper showcases the potential influence of hybrid-electric propulsion systems on the performance of general aviation aircraft. Using the Cirrus SR-22 as a baseline, parallel- and serial-hybrid propulsion configurations are explored. For these case studies a high level approach is chosen, using an innovative initial sizing methodology to determine weight or energy consumption of new aircraft concepts. Mission parameters and aerodynamic performance are varied and the impact on aircraft fuel and energy consumption, as well as on take-off mass is studied. The studies' results indicate that hybrid-electric aircraft consume less energy than conventionally propelled designs for certain missions. However, the aircraft's design point, in terms of wing loading and installed power must be changed: Hybrid-electric aircraft should be sized with a higher power-to-weight ratio and a higher wing loading than their conventional counterparts."
"The economic benefits of reductions in nitrogen loads from stormwater runoff by street trees Stemflow; Interception; Throughfall It is increasingly recognised that urban trees can contribute to reducing stormwater runoff by intercepting and retaining a fraction of rainfall received. What is less studied is the translation of this to reduced pollutant loads being transferred to receiving streams, rivers, and water bodies. In this paper, we assess interception of two tree species (Eucalyptus microcorys and Ulmus procera) in an urban park. These data are used in simple water balance modelling to predict the environmental and economic benefit of reducing nitrogen loads to receiving waterways as a function of reduced runoff volume resulting from rainfall interception by urban trees on public land (21% of the catchment area). We use a highly urbanized catchment in Melbourne, Australia to demonstrate the impact of an urban forest dominated by deciduous trees, evergreen trees or a mixed tree canopy cover. We found that doubling the urban canopy cover in the catchment, while keeping the current mix ratio of deciduous and evergreen trees, could reduce annual runoff volume by 30 mm (92 MLyrÌ„1). Using the prescribed values that developers must pay the local water authority for nitrogen treatment as a condition of new development, we calculate that this would deliver a nitrogen load removal benefit of AUD$ 200/tree. If only deciduous trees are planted, the annual runoff reduction would decrease to 24 mm (73 MLyrÌ„1) and increases to 37 mm (112 MLyrÌ„1) if only evergreen trees are planted. This study highlights both the additional benefits of public street trees and the differences in deciduous and evergreen trees which should be accounted for by policy makers."

"Catalytic co-liquefaction of sugarcane bagasse and polyethylene for bio-oil production under supercritical conditions: Effect of catalysts Hydrothermal Liquefaction; Bio-Oil; Biofuel Catalytic co-liquefaction of high-density polyethylene and sugarcane bagasse over metal salt and oxide catalysts in ethanol solvent was investigated. The obtained bio-oil samples were analyzed and characterized by gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectroscopy (GCâ€“MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), ultimate analysis (CHNS/O), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and different solid products characterized by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis. The results suggested that adding ZnSO4 gives the highest HHV (34.61 MJ/kg), while CuSO4 gives the highest bio-oil yield (38.42 %) and conversion (69.54 %). GCâ€“MS analysis suggested that the bio-oils contained large amounts of hydrocarbons, phenols, ketone aldehydes, alcohols and esters. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were integrated over spectral regions to quantify classes of carbon and hydrogen atoms in each bio-oil and suggested that bio-oils largely contain alkanes, aliphatics and alcohols. The liquid products are promising bio-fuel precursors for further utilization."
"Marriage trafficking: Women in forced wedlock Human Trafficking; Sexual Exploitation; Prostitution This book examines the traffic in women for marriage, a phenomenon that has been largely overlooked in international efforts to address the problem of human trafficking. In contrast to current international and state-based approaches to trafficking, which tend to focus on sex trafficking and trafficking for forced labour, this book seeks to establish how marriage as an institution is often implicated in the occurrence of trafficking in women. The book aims firstly to establish why marriage has tended not to be included in dominant conceptions of trafficking in persons and secondly to determine whether certain types of marriage may constitute cases of human trafficking, in and of themselves. Through the use of case studies on forced marriage, mail-order bride (MOB) marriage and Fundamentalist Mormon polygamy, this book demonstrates that certain kinds of marriage may in fact constitute situations of trafficking in persons and together form the under-recognised phenomenon of â€˜marriage traffickingâ€™. In addition, the book offers a new perspective on the types of harm involved in trafficking in women by developing a framework for identifying the particular abuses characteristic to marriage trafficking. It argues that the traffic in women for marriage cannot be understood merely as a subset of sex trafficking or trafficking for forced labour, but rather constitutes a distinctive form of trafficking in its own right. This book will be of great interest to scholars and postgraduates working in the fields of human rights theory and institutions, political science, international law, transnational crime, trafficking in persons and feminist political theory."
"Impacts of Collaborative Partnership on the Performance of Cold Supply Chains of Agriculture and Foods: Literature Review Sales; Options Contract; Supply Chain Coordination Collaboration in a supply chain continuously proves its role in increasing the performance of supply chains, which attracts the attention of both academia and practitioners, specifically, how to generate higher impacts of collaborative partnership on the performance of supply chains and measure them. In cold supply chains of agriculture and foods, the vital need for collaboration becomes even more significant to improve the performance. Therefore, this paper reviews relevant articles derived from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Via the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), the research team classifies the types of collaborative partnership in cold agriculture and food supply chains, issues of the literature when analyzing collaboration impacts on the performance of CSCs of agriculture and foods, and finally, the opportunities for the future research to boost the collaboration practices in these cold chains. Following this sequence, 102 articles were eventually extracted for the systematic review to identify themes for not only addressing the review questions but also highlighting future research opportunities for both development of partnership integration and performance of the cold chains of agriculture and foods."

"Experiencing the body as play Video Games; Exercise; Gaming Games research in HCI is continually interested in the human body. However, recent work suggests that the field has only begun to understand how to design bodily games. We propose that the games research field is advancing from playing with digital content using a keyboard, to using bodies to play with digital content, towards a future where we experience our bodies as digital play. To guide designers interested in supporting players to experience their bodies as play, we present two phenomenological perspectives on the human body (KÃ¶rper and Leib) and articulate a suite of design tactics using our own and other people's work. We hope with this paper, we are able to help designers embrace the point that we both ""have"" a body and ""are"" a body, thereby aiding the facilitation of the many benefits of engaging the human body through games and play, and ultimately contributing to a more humanized technological future."
"Listening to Voices from the Margins: Transforming Environmental Education Intersectionality; Feminism; Social Location In the past, women, queer, Indigenous and disabled people, as well as race, class and body size issues, have been overlooked in most environmental education programs through being subsumed into the notion of â€œuniversalised people,â€ the â€œnorm.â€ However, people in each of these marginalised groups has a distinctive contribution to make to environmental education, as a form of anti-oppressive resistance, which needs to be foregrounded. In this chapter I problematize the relative silencing of queer theory and theorizing in environmental education and discuss the contributions that queer(y)ing perspectives bring to environmental education. In particular, I discuss some possibilities for new directions for environmental education where queer ecopedagogies and research, intersectionality and assemblages are used to listen to, and work with, â€œqueerâ€ voices."
"Analysis of Business Practice and Opportunities in the Construction Industry of UAE in Comparison to Gulf States Costs And Cost Analysis; Construction Project; Change Orders This research focuses on the analysis of business practices and opportunities in the construction industry across United Arab Emirates (UAE). It describes emerging business practices and some business opportunities for investment. New state initiatives put in place that are geared towards global outreach are highlighted. It is evident that the economic focus shifts from oil to other means of investment, particularly building infrastructure is fundamental in the accelerated development of the internal market. The work draws extensively from secondary sources of information as the means of exploring available business data to better understand the industry in the context of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members. Various initiatives in line with the UAE Centennial that offer opportunities for foreign businesses are outlined. Extensive market has already emerged within the region in terms of technology, investment, and innovation, given the emerging business practices as a part of a tolerant and globalized environment. The paper analyses the outlook for the UAEâ€™s construction industry in line with the current national initiatives. It provides insight into how the market can benefit from this shift and where opportunities lie for foreign input and investment."
"Determination of economical thermal insulation thickness for a building wall with two parallel structures Walls (Structural Partitions); Hot Temperature; Insulation Because of the existence of beams, columns, shear walls, and other structural components, the external wall of a building is often composed of two parallel structures, wherein one is a concrete structure and the other is made of bricks. Therefore, to determine the economical thermal insulation thickness of an external wall, one can not only consider a single structure. Mathematical models of economical thermal insulation thickness considering and not considering the effect of non-homogeneity of external walls were established based on the method of life-cycle cost. The economical thermal insulation thickness and economic benefits of a building wall in Beijing that is composed of two parallel structures with EPS thermal insulation were comparatively analyzed. The comparisons were carried out with two different heat sources and three different concrete structure-to-external wall ratios. The results show that non-homogeneity of external walls have a considerable influence on the economical thermal insulation thickness and economic benefit of an insulating external wall. The economical thermal insulation thickness under the consideration of non-homogeneity of external walls will become thicker. However, the increase in life-cycle cost is not significant, whereas the increase in life-cycle saving is very significant, and the payback period becomes shorter. The effectiveness of the investment and the energy efficiency revenue without consideration of the effect of non-homogeneity of external walls are underestimated. Thus, a method that considers this effect can obtain more reasonable economical insulation thicknesses and economic benefits."
"Coffee farmer preferences for sustainable agricultural practices: Findings from discrete choice experiments in Vietnam Willingness To Pay; Stated Preference; Best-worst Scaling Despite the proven benefits of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs), adoption rates among farmers are still low, especially in developing countries. This paper seeks to assist policymakers devise approaches to encourage adoption by identifying the attributes of SAPs that can motivate Vietnamese coffee farmers to adopt them in production. Vietnam is the world's second largest coffee producer and the sector supports the livelihoods of over half a million people in the country. We conduct two different types of discrete choice experiments with over 300 Vietnamese coffee farmers to identify their SAP preferences. We analyse the data using cluster analysis and generalised multinomial logit models. The results are consistent across our different approaches. They show that these farmers have the strongest preferences for SAPs that can provide higher profits, lower risks (of output loss) and higher environmental benefits. These attributes received mean part-worth utilities of 0.251, 0.250 and 0.239 respectively. Attributes capturing the increase in daily operating efforts and time required to set up such practices are less important considerations. Further, the farmers are willing to pay on average between 26 and 32 million VND per hectare per year for a one level reduction in the risk of output loss and earn 15 million VND per hectare per year less in profits to achieve a one level increase in environmental benefits."
"Housing and occupant health: Findings from Vietnam Housing Tenure; Housing Conditions; Occupiers This paper investigates how poor-quality housing affects Vietnamese individualsâ€™ health, measured using the number of sick days, which directly affects productivity and economic growth. Our analysis addresses endogeneity issues generally ignored in previous studies. We provide evidence, robust to various alterations that, the absence of an indoor water tap and homeownership, harmful indoor cooking fuel type, and the poor physical structure of the dwelling have adverse impacts on individualsâ€™ health. Our findings indicate that the adverse effects of housing on health arise from a larger spectrum of housing issues in rural areas compared to urban areas. We also find that the intensity in deprived housing conditions has a non-linear relationship with health, suggesting that even some degree of housing assistance can have a beneficial impact on individualsâ€™ health. Our study provides useful policy guides and informs healthy living practices."
"Public transportation in Hanoi: Applying an integrative model of behavioral intention Habit; Perceived Behavioral Control; Mode Choice Hanoi is a populous capital with consistently growing transportation demands. This study applies an integrative model based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), service satisfaction, and environmental concern, in order to examine behavioral intention to use public transportation systems. Using 873 completed questionnaires collected from residents in Hanoi who have used public transport before. The study demonstrates that attitude, perceived behavioral control, personal norms, and descriptive norms influence behavioral intention. The impact of subjective norms lessens when descriptive norms and personal norms are included in this integrative model. Environmental concern indirectly affected behavioral intention through attitude, perceived behavioral control, and personal norms, thus strengthening the TPB model. This shows the appropriateness of this TPB-based integrative model, while service satisfaction is not an important motivation for changing from private vehicles to public bus systems. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed, along with suggestions for future research."

"Attitudinal support for violence against women: What a population-level survey of the Australian community can and cannot tell us Intimate Partner Violence; Violence Against Women; Domestic Violence Violence against women (VAW) is a serious and prevalent problem globally. Societal-level norms, practices and structures are among the factors contributing to it, sometimes referred to collectively as representing â€œcultures of supportâ€ for VAW. Understanding factors contributing to these cultures is important for prevention, but remains the subject of debate. Population-level surveys of attitudes toward VAW are one means to strengthen this understanding. Although there are a number of such surveys internationally, scholarly research based on secondary analysis of data, at least from surveys in high-income countries, is scant. This article reports on new analyses of the Australian National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women survey to explore its potential to further empirical and conceptual understanding of cultures of support for VAW. To facilitate this, a scale to measure attitudes toward VAW was developed post hoc from the survey (the Violence Supportive Attitudes, or VSA-18, Scale). Subsequent analyses investigate the relationship between this scale and relevant demographic factors and a measure of attitudinal support for gender equality (GE). The GE measure, place of birth, employment and occupation, generation, education and sex contribute to variance in the VSA-18 Scale. Findings are discussed in the context of theoretical debates and directions for future research."

"Direct and Indirect Effects of Climate Change in Coastal Wetlands: Will Climate Change Influence Wetlands by Affecting Plant Invasion? Salt Marshes; Spartina Alterniflora; Wetlands Introduced species and climate change can have direct impacts on wetland communities, but they can also produce indirect effects such that climate change (i.e., effects of flooding and salinity) can affect native plants by exacerbating or reducing invasion. We assessed the direct and indirect effects of flooding, salinity, and introduced species on wetland communities across a salinity gradient by analyzing existing monitoring data from over 390 Coastwide Reference and Monitoring Sites (CRMS) using path analysis. As expected, we found that introduced species cover and richness was highest in fresh marshes and decreased across the salinity gradient. In fresh marshes, introduced cover and salinity separately negatively affected native cover and richness, but there were no indirect effects. In intermediate marshes, introduced cover and salinity reduced native cover and richness, and indirect effects were weakly positive because salinity negatively affected introduced cover. In brackish and saline marshes increasing salinity and flooding reduced native cover and richness. Our results suggest that climate change will negatively affect all wetland plant communities, and invasion will negatively affect fresher wetlands; however, climate change will not exacerbate invasions in wetlands and could reduce introduced species effects."
"An overview of microwave hydrothermal carbonization and microwave pyrolysis of biomass Bio-Oil; Pyrolysis; Microwave Biomass utilization has received much attention for production of high density solid fuels. Utilization of cheap and naturally available precursors through environmentally friendly and effective processes is an attractive and emerging research area. Pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) are well-known technologies available for production of solid biofuel using conventional or microwave heating. Microwave heating is a simpler and more efficient heating method than conventional heating. This study presents a critical review on microwave pyrolysis and microwave HTC for solid fuel production in terms of yield and quality of products. Moreover, a brief summary of parameters of microwave pyrolysis and microwave HTC are discussed. The fuel, chemical, structural and thermal weight loss characteristics of solid fuels produced from different biomass are discussed and compared."
"Photochemical Etching of Carbonyl Groups from a Carbon Matrix: The (001) Diamond Surface Diamond; Polishing; Vapor Deposition The surface of diamond is reported to undergo nonablative photochemical etching when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation which allows controlled single and partial layer removal of lattice layers. Oxygen termination of surface dangling bonds is known to be crucial for the etching process; however, the exact mechanism of carbon ejection remains unclear. We investigate the interaction of UV laser pulses with oxygen-terminated diamond surfaces using atomic-scale surface characterization combined with first-principles time-dependent density functional theory calculations. We present evidence for laser-induced desorption (LID) from carbonyl functional groups at the diamond {001} surface. The doubly bonded carbonyl group is photoexcited into a triply bonded CO-like state, including scission of the underlying CC bonds. The carbon removal process in LID is atom by atom; therefore, this mechanism provides a novel ""top-down"" approach for creating nanostructures on the surface of diamond and other carbon-containing semiconductors."
"The “Gender Agenda” in Agriculture for Development and Its (Lack of) Alignment With Feminist Scholarship Farmers; Women in Agriculture; Farm Families Sustainable food systems require sustainable agriculture. To achieve this, we argue, inclusive approaches are required that incorporate the voices and lived experiences of diverse social groups. In agriculture-based international development efforts (known as Agriculture for Development or A4D), it is increasingly being recognized that sustainable agriculture requires attention to gendered power relations. In the past, gender inequality has been a major barrier to developing inclusive, sustainable food systems, and continues to be so today. At the same time, however, gender is increasingly â€œon the agendaâ€ in A4D. Yet what sort of agenda is being promoted and to what extent does it reflect progress in feminist scholarship? We examine the burgeoning â€œgender agendaâ€ through the lens of policy materials produced by prominent A4D organizations. In doing so, we find problematic narratives that instrumentalise women in the name of sustainable agricultural development. However, we also find other more transformative discourses that, in troubling the drivers of gender inequality and promoting shared responsibility for change, reflect a deeper awareness of feminist scholarship. In any effort to advance sustainable agriculture, further progress is needed to address the myriad ways gender pervades not just development settings but development institutions and donor nations, and contributes to the production of as well as responses to global A4D challenges."
"Breakdowns in inter-organisational information sharing: The case of major incidents in Bangladesh Activity Theory; Psychological Practice; Self-Confrontation This study investigates breakdowns in information sharing among different actors involved in responding to major incidents such as police, fire, local government and NGOs. While previous studies on inter-organisational information sharing and collaboration in a disaster context have largely been undertaken in Europe, Australia and the USA; this study will focus on a developing country, Bangladesh, which faces both organisational and institutional challenges alongside a projected increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather-related disasters. The study adopts a qualitative case study approach of multiple organisations comprising observation, interviews and document analysis. Activity theory informs the study. A major contribution of this research will be a better understanding of how actors share information during major incidents and how the arising contradictions are resolved in practice. Theoretically, it will outline the contradictions in inter-organisational information sharing and how actors mitigate these contradictions during major incidents."
"Functional analysis of pristine estuarine marine sediments Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus Traditional environmental monitoring techniques are well suited to resolving acute exposure effects but lack resolution in determining subtle shifts in ecosystem functions resulting from chronic exposure(s). Surveillance with sensitive omics-based technologies could bridge this gap but, to date, most omics-based environmental studies have focused on previously degraded environments, identifying key metabolic differences resulting from anthropogenic perturbations. Here, we apply omics-based approaches to pristine environments to establish blueprints of microbial functionality within healthy estuarine sediment communities. We collected surface sediments (n = 50) from four pristine estuaries along the Western Cape York Peninsula of Far North Queensland, Australia. Sediment microbiomes were analyzed for 16S rRNA amplicon sequences, central carbon metabolism metabolites and associated secondary metabolites via targeted and untargeted metabolic profiling methods. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated heterogeneity among all the sampled estuaries, however, taxa-function relationships could be established that predicted community metabolism potential. Twenty-four correlated gene-metabolite pathways were identified and used to establish sediment microbial blueprints of essential carbon metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis that were positively correlated with community metabolic function outputs (2-oxisocapraote, tryptophan, histidine citrulline and succinic acid). In addition, an increase in the 125 KEGG genes related to metal homeostasis and metal resistance was observed, although, none of the detected metabolites related to these specific genes upon integration. However, there was a correlation between metal abundance and functional genes related to Fe and Zn metabolism. Our results establish a baseline microbial blueprint for the pristine sediment microbiome, one that drives important ecosystem services and to which future ecosurveillance monitoring can be compared."
"Competitive Green Supply Chain Transformation with Dynamic Capabilities—An Exploratory Case Study of Chinese Electronics Industry Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices Extant studies identify different strategic approaches for businesses to integrate environment management (EM) into corporate supply chain management (SCM) to create different competitive market advantages. With increasing market uncertainties, stakeholder complexities, constraints of resources, companies nowadays are required to develop more context-specific solutions for mitigating sustainability risk and improving market performance in supply chain sustainability practices. To address the challenges faced by businesses, this study aims to explore how a company adapts green supply chain strategies for a competitive transformation. Specifically, we aim to identify different green supply chain capabilities that form hybrid choices of green solutions for a company to leverage an adaptive green shift. Through an extensive literature review, this study proposes a conceptual framework for exploration which is based on a qualitative in-depth case study in the electronics industryâ€”one of the most polluting manufacturing sectors in China. The findings show that supply chain characteristics play a significant role in the selection of different green SCM solutions by businesses. We find different hybrid choices of strategic decisions are being made by the case company operating with high-volume and high-value supply chains respectively. High-volume supply chains adopt both operational pollution and waste control strategies and incremental green product strategies to balance cost of operational change and develop a competitive eco-efficient market expansion. In contrast, high-value supply chains adopt radical green product innovation strategies and operational waste prevention strategies to balance cost of product innovation and build operational efficiency to expand in a competitive eco-differentiation market. A mix of dynamic capabilities involved in different supply chain green transformations are also identified."

"Tropical cyclone early warnings for the regions of the Southern Hemisphere: strengthening resilience to tropical cyclones in small island developing states and least developed countries El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Wind Shear; Cyclogenesis Tropical cyclones (TCs) affect countries in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) tropics every year causing significant humanitarian impacts and much damage to the natural environment. To reduce TC impacts on societies, early warning systems (EWS) are used to communicate the risk to the public. In 1999, the Climate Change and Southern Hemisphere Tropical Cyclones International Initiative (CCSHTCII) was established to enhance EWS for TCs in SH countries, with particular focus on support for small island developing states and least developed countries to provide effective public early warnings of TC risk. In this paper, recent activities of the CCSHTCII to strengthen TC EWS are presented. Using TC best track data from the SH TC historical data archive, the impact of the El NiÃ±oâ€“Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on inter-annual and spatial variability of TC activity is examined. TC-ENSO relationships in the SH are analysed and used as a scientific basis for the production of TC season outlooks. Communication of TC early warnings through TC season outlooks is described, and recommendations for improving outlooks are provided."
"Surprising Pseudogobius: Molecular systematics of benthic gobies reveals new insights into estuarine biodiversity (Teleostei: Gobiiformes) Animals; Maccullochella Macquariensis; Percichthyidae Snubnose gobies (genus Pseudogobius: Gobionellinae) are ubiquitous to, and important components of, estuarine ecosystems of the Indo-west Pacific. These small benthic fishes occur in freshwater, brackish and marine habitats such as mangroves, sheltered tide pools and lowland streams, and represent a model group for understanding the biodiversity and biogeography of estuarine fauna. To develop the species-level framework required for a concurrent morphological taxonomic appraisal, we undertook thorough sampling around the extensive Australian coastline, referenced to international locations, as part of a molecular systematic review using both nuclear and mitochondrial markers. The results indicate that while there are currently eight recognised species, the true diversity is close to double this, with a hotspot of endemism located in Australia. Complicated patterns were observed in southern Australia owing to two differing zones of introgression/admixture. Key drivers of diversity in the group appear to include plate tectonics, latitude, and historic barriers under glacial maxima, where an interplay between ready dispersal and habitat specialisation has led to regional panmixia but frequent geographic compartmentalisation within past and present landscapes. The findings have significant implications for biodiversity conservation, coastal and estuarine development, the basic foundations of field ecology, and for applied use such as in biomonitoring."
"Phillip Island Nature Parks Research Project Evaluating interactions of beachgoers and their dogs with local wildlife Phillip Island Nature Parks (PINP) are currently pursuing a number of interventions and awareness campaigns aimed at reducing conflicts and harmful interactions between off-leash dogs and local wildlife on PINP-managed beaches. Reducing harm and disturbance to Hooded Plovers (Thinornis rubricollis) during breeding season has been a focus of these efforts, which has included volunteer observation and discussion with beachgoers who are not following regulations to keep dogs on leads where required. The People, Nature, Place Research Program (PNP) are seeking to assist with research that helps to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of these interventions over time. This research could form the first phase of a wider-reaching, longer term examination of the extent to which the community (local and visitor) understands the protection measures for local wildlife on beaches, and how greater care, respect and responsibility for local wildlife could be fostered amongst beachgoers, residents and visitors to Phillip Island."
"Biological Control of the Noxious Weed Angled Onion (Allium triquetrum) Thwarted by Endophytic Bacteria in Victoria, Australia Quorum Sensing; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa; N-Octanoylhomoserine Lactone The noxious weed Allium triquetrum (Alliaceae) has invaded widespread areas in southern Australia, forming dense monocultures that threaten indigenous ground flora. Two soilborne biocontrol agents, the fungus Stromatinia cepivora and the bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Pcc) have previously been reported as killing A. triquetrum in gnotobiotic controlled conditions. This study aimed to find why glasshouse pot trials in complex potting media and field trials showed no effect of inoculation with either agent. Bacteria were consistently isolated from inside surface-sterilised bases and bulbs of A. triquetrum. Most bacteria from actively growing plants were closely related to Bacillus but one from dormant bulbs (RPTAtOch1) belonged to Ochrobactrum. Most bacteria reduced soft rot caused by Pcc in vitro by up to 100% when inoculated the day before Pcc. Co-cultivation with Pcc reduced its extracellular pectin lyase and polygalacturonase, which target plant cell walls. RPTAtOch1 was identified as O. quorumnocens by traditional physiological, biochemical and molecular tests, whole genome sequencing and Average Nucleotide Identity comparisons. Its draft genome consisted of 76 contigs, 70% of which were closest to isolate A44 of O. quorumnocens, which antagonises soft rotting of potato by Pcc by destroying its quorum-sensing lactones but, like RPTAtOch1, does not inhibit growth of Pcc. Also, endophytic bacteria inhibited germination of S. cepivora sclerotia and so prevented white rot. Thus, the failure in biocontrol of A. triquetrum by both S. cepivora and Pcc may be due, ironically, to biocontrol of the intended pathogens by endophytic bacteria inside the target weed."

"Praziquantel use in aquaculture – Current status and emerging issues Dactylogyrus; Fish; Praziquantel Parasitic diseases are major constraints in fish mariculture. The anthelmintic praziquantel (PZQ) can effectively treat a range of flatworm parasites in a variety of fish species and has potential for broader application than its current use in the global aquaculture industry. In this review we report on PZQ's current use in the aquaculture industry and discuss its efficacy against various flatworm parasites of fish. Routes of PZQ administration are evaluated, along with issues related to palatability, pharmacokinetics and toxicity in fish, while PZQ's effects on non-target species, environmental impacts, and the development of drug-resistance are discussed."
"Non-coding RNAs in legumes: Their emerging roles in regulating biotic/abiotic stress responses and plant growth and development Argonaute Proteins; Gene; Nicotiana Benthamiana Noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interference RNAs (siRNAs), circular RNA (circRNA), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), control gene expression at the transcription, post-transcription, and translation levels. Apart from protein-coding genes, accumulating evidence supports ncRNAs playing a critical role in shaping plant growth and development and biotic and abiotic stress responses in various species, including legume crops. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) interact with DNA, RNA, and proteins, modulating their target genes. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling these cellular processes are not well understood. Here, we discuss the features of various ncRNAs, including their emerging role in contributing to biotic/abiotic stress response and plant growth and development, in addition to the molecular mechanisms involved, focusing on legume crops. Unravelling the underlying molecular mechanisms and functional implications of ncRNAs will enhance our understanding of the coordinated regulation of plant defences against various biotic and abiotic stresses and for key growth and development processes to better design various legume crops for global food security."
"Spatial and temporal variations of trace metal body burdens of live mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis and field validation of the Artificial Mussels in Australian inshore marine environment Mytilus Galloprovincialis; Bivalvia; Heavy Metal The body burdens of eight trace metals: Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr, Se, Hg, and As, were measured in live mussels (LMs) Mytilus galloprovincialis at 14 coastal sites in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia in winter and summer between 2017 and 2018. The spatial and temporal variations of body burdens were evaluated. The results revealed significantly higher body burdens of Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr, and Hg in summer at the sites where the city centre and industries are located. Elevated levels of most trace metals including 3 toxic, non-essential metals (Cd, Pb, and Hg) were detected in LMs from the site of Geelong. The body burdens of Zn, Cr, Se, and As appeared higher at the sites from the Bellarine Peninsula and the mouth of Port Phillip Bay. Besides, the â€œArtificial Musselsâ€ (AMs) were deployed at the same sites in summer for 28 d and retrieved when the LMs were collected. The accumulations of the eight metals were compared between AMs and LMs summer results. It indicated significant correlations for Pb, Cu, and Cr, lower correlations in Zn and Hg, and irregular correlations for Se and As. The AM results of Cd were below the detection limit of the analytical method. This study demonstrates that AMs are excellent replacement of LMs for the biomonitoring of multiple kinds of trace metals."
"Prioritising the eradication of invasive species from island archipelagos with high reinvasion risk Rattus Exulans; Eradication; Island Ecosystem Eradicating invasive species from islands is a proven method for safeguarding threatened and endangered species from extinction. Island eradications can deliver lasting benefits, but require large up-front expenditure of limited conservation resources. The choice of islands must therefore be prioritised. Numerous tools have been developed to prioritise island eradications, but none fully account for the risk of those eradicated species later returning to the island: reinvasion. In this paper, we develop a prioritisation method for island eradications that accounts for the complexity of the reinvasion process. By merging spatially explicit metapopulation modelling with stochastic dynamic optimisation techniques, we construct a decision-support tool that optimises conservation outcomes in the presence of reinvasion risk. We applied this tool to two different case studiesâ€”rat (Rattus rattus) invasions in the Seaforth archipelago in New Zealand, and cane toad (Rhinella marina) invasions in the Dampier archipelago in Australiaâ€”to illustrate how state-dependent optimal policies can maximise expected conservation gains. In both case studies, incorporating reinvasion risk dramatically altered the optimal order of island eradications, and improved the potential conservation benefits. The increase in benefits was larger in Dampier than Seaforth (42% improvement versus 6%), as a consequence of both the characteristics of the invasive species, and the arrangement of the islands. Synthesis and applications. Our results illustrate the potential consequences of ignoring reinvasion risk. We recommend that reinvasion risk be explicitly included in any island eradication prioritisation involving an archipelago, particularly when some islands are close to the mainland."

"Assessing critical infrastructure resilience in terms of its service-providing capacity in coastal Bangladesh: A synthesis of geospatial techniques and social responses Bangladesh; Cyclonic Storms; Disaster Lack of adequate infrastructure, especially in the coastal regions of developing countries, limits the capacity of households to prevent, cope with, and recover from the adverse effects of natural hazards. The services provided by critical infrastructure (CI) contribute to the overall resilience of marginalized coastal households to natural hazards. CI, in turn, may itself be resilient (or not). Resilient CI is capable of providing services to meet the community's demand for that service. This research developed and tested an innovative framework for assessing CI resilience in terms of services it was capable to provide to coastal residents in three separate phases (before, during, and after) of Cyclone Sidr, using empirical evidence from a coastal sub-district of Bangladesh. The disaster-phase-wise level of demand for these services was identified using GIS-based network analysis combined with community rankings of service importance across the disaster phases. Households were surveyed to determine whether they were able to procure CI services in each phase. A comparison of service demand levels with success in procuring CI services was used to assess CI resilience. The results revealed spatio-temporal variation in the service provision of existing CI units to households in the study area. A mixed trend was indicated: less exposed communities contained a somewhat higher percentage of service-receiving households than more exposed communities during the pre- and post-disaster phases, whereas the percentage was higher in the more exposed communities during the syn-disaster phase. This approach has the potential to determine whether the existing CI in a community is resilient enough to support the population in the different phases of a cyclone. The results could guide planners to bolster CI resilience for communities, thereby also improving community resilience to natural hazards."

"Green supply chain collaborative innovation, absorptive capacity and innovation performance: Evidence from China Alliance Portfolios; Firm; Open Innovation Green supply chain collaborative innovation (GSCCI) is about the utilization of specific advantages of individual organizations in a holistic manner along the supply chain through collaboration for jointly solving green management problems. This paper presents a conceptual model for better understanding the relationship between GSCCI, absorptive capacity and innovation performance in organizations. Taking 206 foreign trade organizations in China as the survey object, this study empirically tests and validates the conceptual model using multiple regression analysis. The study shows that organization-organization collaborative innovation, organization-government collaborative innovation, and organization-institution collaborative innovation have a significant positive effect on innovation performance. It reveals that absorptive capacity has a significant positive effect on innovation performance. Furthermore, the study finds out that absorptive capacity plays a partially mediating role in the relationship between organization-organization collaborative innovation and innovation performance and between organization-institution collaborative innovation and innovation performance. This study illustrates the mechanism of GSCCI and its impact on innovation performance which provides guideline for foreign trade organizations in China to better compete in the international market through collaborative innovation."

"Co-Mo microcolumns decorated with trace Pt for large current density hydrogen generation in alkaline seawater Catalyst; Cobalt Phosphide; Water Splitting Electrolysis in seawater is cost-saving but challenging approach for hydrogen production. In this study, self-supported anticaustic three dimensional (3D) microcolumns anchored with trace Pt clusters on nickel foam (NF) is prepared through solvothermal followed by thermal reduction procedures (Pt-Co-Mo). The as-synthesized electrode owns superhydrophilic and aerophilic surface which favors close contact between the electrode and electrolyte and release of the generated hydrogen bubbles. Besides, the strong synergistic effect between Pt and matrix lead to a significantly improved HER intrinsic activity. Thanks to the above merits, the self-supported Pt-Co-Mo electrode presents outstanding HER activity, which only requires an extremely low overpotentials of 179.2 mV and 194.1 mV to reach a large current density of 2000 mA cmâˆ’2 in 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH seawater, respectively. For overall water splitting, cell voltages down to 1.50 V and 1.51 V are necessary to drive 10 mA cmâˆ’2 in 1 M KOH and alkaline seawater, respectively."
"Axial stress-strain performance of recycled aggregate concrete reinforced with macro-polypropylene fibres Concrete Aggregates; Construction and Demolition Waste; Mechanical Properties The addition of macro-polypropylene fibres improves the stress-strain performance of natural aggregate concrete (NAC). However, limited studies focus on the stress-strain performance of macro-polypropylene fibre-reinforced recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). Considering the variability of coarse recycled aggregates (CRA), more studies are needed to investigate the stress-strain performance of macro-polypropylene fibre-reinforced RAC. In this study, a new type of 48 mm long BarChip macro-polypropylene fibre with a continuously embossed surface texture is used to produce BarChip fibre-reinforced NAC (BFNAC) and RAC (BFRAC). The stress-strain performance of BFNAC and BFRAC is studied for varying dosages of BarChip fibres. Results show that the increase in energy dissipation capacity (i.e., area under the curve), peak stress, and peak strain of samples is observed with an increase in fibre dosage, indicating the positive effect of fibre addition on the stress-strain performance of concrete. The strength enhancement due to the addition of fibres is higher for BFRAC samples than BFNAC samples. The reduction in peak stress, ultimate strain, toughness and specific toughness of concrete samples due to the utilisation of CRA also reduces with the addition of fibres. Hence, the negative effect of CRA on the properties of concrete samples can be minimised by adding BarChip macro-polypropylene fibres. The applicability of the stress-strain model previously developed for macro-synthetic and steel fibre-reinforced NAC and RAC to BFNAC and BFRAC is also examined."
"Isophorone-boronate ester: A simple chemosensor for optical detection of fluoride anion Luminescence; Boron; Diborane A highly selective isophorone-boronate ester based chemosensor, (1), having a dicyanovinyl moiety as a convenient colorimetric probe, has been designed. Different types of anionic analyte such as CH3COOâˆ’, ClO4 âˆ’, Clâˆ’, Fâˆ’, PF6 âˆ’, Brâˆ’ and HSO4 âˆ’ were tested and among them only highly nucleophilic Fâˆ’ anion displayed significant response towards the sensor. Addition of the fluoride anion across the boron atom disrupts the Ï€-conjugation thereby shifts the absorption wavelength towards the redshift region due to the decrease in the HOMO-LUMO energy gap and a colour change from yellow to blue is observed under visible light condition. The detection limit of this probe was calculated to be 3.25 Ã— 10â€”8 M for fluoride anion. The binding constants and the detection limits of the sensor were calculated using absorption titration studies. The silica gel TLC strips dip-coated by the chemosensor (1) revealed a colour change from yellow to brick red to naked eye."
"Social Work and the Sustainable Development Goals: A Student Placement Model Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations The United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a blueprint to address urgent global challenges, with a clear role for social workers. This paper explores a Sustainable Development Goalâ€™s focused student placement at the Australian Association of Social Workers, with RMIT University. Students reviewed the AASWâ€™s policy actions and their contribution to the SDGs, including recommendations for future work. The review identified advocacy in key areas, and the need for action on several issues, including climate action. Students learned about social work policy, practice, and sustainability. The placement itself provides a model for other organisations to align their actions to the SDGs. IMPLICATIONS There is a need for greater social work engagement with the United Nationsâ€™ SDGs to address urgent social and environmental challenges. Field education placements can provide an important opportunity for students to learn about sustainability, social work policy practice, and the SDGs. The placement model proposed in the article is suitable for any organisation that seeks to review their actions and better align their work to the SDGs."
"Numerical investigation on the condensation of R134a, R1234ze(E) and R450A in mini-channels Refrigerants; Pressure Drop; Condensation R450A is one of R134a substitutions owing to its low GWP and similar refrigeration performance. The existing researches are mostly about its performance in refrigeration systems. This paper focuses on its heat transfer characteristics in condensation. By combining the SST k-Ï‰ model with the VOF method, the condensation of R450A, and its two components, R134a and R1234ze(E), in mini-channels were explored. The mass flux ranges from 400 to 800 kgâ€¢mâˆ’2â€¢sâˆ’1. The vapor quality is between 0.4 and 1. The tube diameters are 1mm and 2mm. The results show when the mass flux is 400, 600, and 800 kgâ€¢mâˆ’2â€¢sâˆ’1, HTC of R134a is 11.3%-16.3%, 7.5%-15.3%, and 8.2%-14.7% higher than that of R450A, and HTC of R1234ze(E) is 5.2%-12.0%, 4.9%-12.5%, and 6.7%-14.1% higher than that of R450A. Moreover, their film thickness and axial velocity are also compared. When the vapor quality is 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9, compared with the average liquid film of R450A, that of R1234ze(E) is 1.2%, 8.8%, and 11.1% thinner and that of R134a is 4.4%, 3.6%, and 1.0% thicker, respectively. The effects of vapor quality, mass flux, channel diameter, and fluid property on the condensation of R450A are also analyzed."
"A greedy-model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for Beyond-5G cooperative data collection Drone; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; Base Stations Data collection is an essential part of Beyond-5G and Internet of Things applications. In urban area, heterogeneous access points such as Wi-Fi routers and base stations can meet the required communication coverage and bandwidth in data collection processes. However, in remote area, without communication infrastructures, it is hard to guarantee the communication quality of a large-scale data aggregation network. An existing approach is to use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to act as a mobile sink to perform data collection and increase the coverage of intelligent wireless sensing and communications. The efficiency and the reliability of such a UAV-assisted data collection system can be significantly enhanced with an intelligent cooperative strategy for the sensors deployed in the field to communicate with the UAV. Furthermore, an energy-efficient trajectory planning algorithm is crucial to address the physical limitations of the UAV in this application. In this paper, a data collection process is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). The paper begins with proposing two heuristic greedy algorithms, namely distance-greedy (DG) algorithm and rate-greedy (RG) algorithm, which are designed based on prior knowledge of the system and can guarantee the completion of the data collection process in a remote area without the help of fixed communication infrastructures. Based on the outcomes, a multi-agent greedy-model-based reinforcement learning (MG-RL) algorithm is proposed, which specifically designs the environmental state and the reward scheme, and introduces multiple UAVs with different parameters to explore environments in parallel to accelerate the training. In conclusion, the two proposed greedy algorithms have lower complexity of implementation while the proposed MG-RL algorithm yields practical UAVsâ€™ flight trajectories and shortens the time for completing a data collection task."
"Zinc biofortified wheat cultivar lessens grain cadmium accumulation under cadmium contaminated conditions Biofortification; Zinc Fertilizers; Triticum Turgidum Subsp. Durum Zinc (Zn) efficient wheat genotypes have been developed to enhance grain Zn concentration to combat the Zn malnutrition in humans. However, such biofortified genotypes/cultivars may also take up the toxic metals from heavy-metals contaminated soils due to similarities with Zn uptake and transport mechanisms in plants. This study was designed to explore uptake of a ubiquitous toxic metal i.e., cadmium (Cd) by a Zn-efficient (Zincol-2016) and was compared with Zn-inefficient (Faisalabad- 2008) wheat cultivar. Both wheat cultivars were sown in pots till maturity in Zn and Cd amended soil. Growth and yield response, and distribution of Cd and Zn, in roots, shoot and grains were observed. Significant differences in Zn and Cd concentration in root, shoot and grain were found among both cultivars in response of Zn and Cd application. Zincol-2016 was more efficient cultivar for Zn uptake compared to the Faisalabad-2008. Cd uptake was increased by both cultivars and suppressed plant growth in Cd contaminated soil. However, Zn application in Cd contaminated soil significantly diminished the Cd uptake and vice versa. Interestingly, Cd concentration was higher in root of Zincol-2016 as compared to Faisalabad-2008; similar was the case in shoot of both cultivars, while it was lower in grain of Zincol-2016. In conclusion, Zn efficient cultivar not only produces high Zn grains but also has ability to contain Cd in root and shoot reducing its accumulation in grains. Furthermore, Zn fertilization in Cd contaminated soils can decrease Cd uptake by plants and may be used as an ameliorating strategy to grow wheat in Cd contaminated soils."
"The paradox of accounting for cultural heritage: a longitudinal study on the financial reporting of heritage assets of major Australian public cultural institutions (1992–2019) Accrual Accounting; International Public Sector Accounting Standards; Local Government Purpose: The monetary valuation of cultural heritage of a selection of 16 major public, not-for-profit Australian cultural institutions is examined over a period of almost three decades (1992â€“2019) to understand how they have responded to the paradoxical tensions of heritage valuation for financial reporting purposes. Design/methodology/approach: Accounting for cultural heritage is an intrinsically paradoxical practice; it involves a conflict of two opposite ways of attributing value: the traditional accounting and the heritage professionals (or curatorial) approaches. In analysing the annual reports and other documentary sources through qualitative content analysis, the study explores how different actors responded to the conceptual and technical contradictions posed by the monetary valuation of â€œheritage assetsâ€, the accounting phraseology of accounting standards. Findings: Four phases emerge from the analysis undertaken of the empirical material, each characterised by a distinctive nature of the paradox, the institutional responses discerned and the outcomes. Although a persisting heterogeneity in the practice of accounting for cultural heritage is evident, responses by cultural institutions are shown to have minimised, so far, the negative impacts of monetary valuation in terms of commercialisation of deaccessioning decisions and distorted accountability. Originality/value: In applying the theoretical lens of paradox theory in the context of the financial reporting of heritage, as assets, the study enhances an understanding of the challenges and responses by major public cultural institutions in a country that has led this development globally, providing insights to accounting standard setters arising from the accounting practices observed."
"Assessment and management of lake eutrophication: A case study in Lake Erhai, China Sediment-Water Interface; Total Dissolved Phosphorus; Sediment Some wastewater sources, such as agricultural waste and runoff, and industrial sewage, can degrade water quality. This study summarises the sources and corresponding mechanisms that trigger eutrophication in lakes. Additionally, the trophic status index and water quality index (WQI) which are effective tools for evaluating the degree of eutrophication of lakes, have been discussed. This study also explores the main nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) driving transformations in the water body and sediment. Lake Erhai was used as a case study, and it was found to be in a mesotrophic state, with N and P co-limitation before 2006, and only P limitation since 2006. Finally, effective measures to maintain sustainable development in the watershed are proposed, along with a framework for an early warning system adopting the latest technologies (geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing (RS)) for preventing eutrophication."
"A comparison of environmental impacts between rainwater harvesting and rain garden scenarios Bioretention Areas; Stormwater Management; Green Infrastructure Rain garden (RG) is a simple alternative to reduce pollutant loads carried through runoff. However, RG construction impacts the environment, where it demands evidence of net benefits generated once commissioned for operation. This study has simulated the reduction of runoff and pollutant loads due to the installation of RGs. Consequently, the reduction of the impacts on the environment was estimated using the LCA method. A comparison was carried out between the scenarios with and without RG with the most feasible (environmentally) rainwater harvesting (RWH) system. Three RG sizes are considered, such as 3, 4, and 6 m2 in dry, average, and wet annual rainfall conditions. The catchment-scale results showed that the runoff generation impacts of the RGs' operation phase were about (24â€“54%), (21â€“49%), (21â€“47%), and (14â€“45%) of the system without RG on eutrophication, human toxicity-carcinogenic, ecotoxicity-freshwater, and ecotoxicity-marine, respectively. However, once fabrication & installation were added, RG had much higher net impacts than without RG, except for eutrophication and ecotoxicity-freshwater. Hence, the net ecotoxicity-freshwater impact was lower for all scenarios except 4 and 6 m2 RG sizes during dry rainfall conditions. The most feasible RWH scenarios (e.g., 2000 & 3000 L tanks) had net impacts of 3â€“81% of the RG systems on global warming, human toxicity-carcinogenic, and ecotoxicity-terrestrial categories. On the other hand, RWH had net impacts of 105â€“200% on ozone depletion and eutrophication and 51â€“119% on the ecotoxicity-freshwater and ecotoxicity-marine of the RG systems."
"Numerical investigation of multi-SDBD plasma actuators for controlling fluctuating wind load on building roofs Plasma Jets; Actuator; Airfoils The present research aims to explore, by large-eddy simulation (LES), the potentiality and mechanism of multiple surface dielectric barrier discharge (multi-SDBD) plasma actuators to manipulate mean and fluctuating wind loads on a low-rise building. Three actuator configurations are located on the roof to induce directional wall jets in different directions. The effects of these configurations on flow structure and wind loads are studied in absence and presence of approaching flow. Results show that all subgrid-scale models can obtain accurate roof pressure, and for the diffusion and convection terms, the bounded central differencing scheme can provide more accurate predictions for the roof pressure. The control impact of active actuators gradually weakens with the increase of the approaching flow velocity. The direction of the wall jet can determine the position of the limited roof region with the reduced mean pressure coefficient. The multi-SDBD actuators continue to absorb the upstream flow and blow this flow downstream, meaning the wall jet exerts strong pressure on the local roof area at the end of the jet, which results in a significant reduction of the mean pressure coefficient. Furthermore, the counter-rotating vortices caused by the wall jet restrain the size and strength of the vortex shedding, thereby achieving the purpose of reducing the fluctuating pressure coefficient. Further analysis of the instantaneous vorticity fields indicates that the intensity and size of streamwise shedding vortices can be restrained by small-scale spanwise vortices induced by the plasma actuators. Under the action of the wall jet blowing from the trailing edge to the leading edge, the fluctuating lift and drag coefficients can be reduced by over 15% and the fluctuating pressure coefficient can be reduced by about 20% from the no actuation situation."
"The neo-colonized entity: Examining the ongoing significance of colonialism on free speech in Singapore Education; General Elections; British Colonies This paper examines the use of colonial era laws to restrict free speech in Singapore, along with more recent laws that are meant to stifle criticism of the state. It draws a link between current statutes and colonial laws, showing that two of the fundamental decrees restricting free speech in Singapore originated from British colonialism. It concludes by pointing out that free speech does exist in Singapore in some respects, in that it remains the sole purview of the state which exercises free speech liberally but uses the Singaporean justice system to deny the same for its citizens."
"The causative relationship between natural resource rent and economic growth: evidence from Ghana’s crude oil resource extraction Resource Curse; Economic Growth; Extractive Industries Purpose: While the relationship between natural resource rent and economic growth is well documented in the literature, not much robust analysis has been done to estimate the causative relationship between oil resource rent and economic growth in Ghana. This might be due to the fact that commercial production of crude oil started not long ago in Ghana. This paper aims to examine the causal relationship between oil resource rent and economic growth for the period of 2011 to 2020 in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The study incorporates economic growth as a function of oil resource rent, non-oil revenue, foreign direct investment, capital and interest rate in a Cobbâ€“Douglass production function/model. The study used four different estimation strategies including the autoregressive distributed lags model, Todaâ€“Yamamoto test approach, nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags model and nonlinear Granger causality. Findings: The main finding revealed that 1% increase in oil resource rent generates 0.84% increase in economic growth of Ghana in the long run. Contrary, the authors find an insignificant positive effect of oil resource rent on economic growth of Ghana in the short run for the period under study. The result from the Todaâ€“Yamamoto test approach also showed a unidirectional causality running from oil resource rent to economic growth of Ghana, providing evidence in support of the resource blessing hypothesis in Ghana. The results are robust to two different alternative estimation strategies. Originality/value: The causal relationship between crude oil resource rent and economic growth is examined."
"Quality of life among ostomy patients: A narrative literature review Ostomy; Stomata; Enterostomy Aim and objective: This study aims to identify and summarise factors related to ostomy patientsâ€™ experiences and how these impact the perceived quality of life for those patients. Background: Ostomy formation is a common therapeutic technique used to treat different colorectal diseases such as colorectal cancer. Although surgical intervention and ostomy formation may prolong a patient's life, it may cause many problems in their daily lifestyle and affect their quality of life. The surgical creation of an ostomy has a significant impacts on a patient's quality of life from multiple perspectives, including physical, psychological, social and spiritual aspects. Design: A narrative literature review, using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline). Methods: This review analysis of search filters was conducted in the following databases: PubMed (MEDLINE), CINAHL, Embase, ProQuest, Science Direct, Scopus, and PsycINFO. A validation data set of 283 research articles between January 2000 and December 2019 were used to identify the impact of stoma surgery on patientsâ€™ quality of life. Result: Thirty-seven studies were identified as suitable for inclusion in this literature review. The results of the review indicate that quality of life (QoL) in patients who have an ostomy is influenced by many modifiable factors. Exercise, preoperative stoma site identification, family support, maintenance of social networks, education, spirituality and financial stability are all potentially modifiable factors that can improve the QOL for ostomy patients. Conclusion: This review has identified multiple challenges that ostomy patients experience, which were clustered according to physical, psychological, social and spiritual challenges. Relevance to clinical practice: This study identifies issues associated with stoma creation and can help in planning and providing the required nursing care which may assist in the reduction of predictable challenges. Recommendations for future research related to nursing practice are stated."

"Mechanical properties, corrosion, and biocompatibility of Mg-Zr-Sr-Dy alloys for biodegradable implant applications Magnesium Alloys; Biodegradable Implant; Corrosion This study investigates the microstructure, mechanical properties, corrosion behavior, and biocompatibility of magnesium (Mg)-based Mg1Zr2SrxDy (x = 0, 1, 1.63, 2.08 wt %) alloys for biodegradable implant applications. The corrosion behavior of the Mg-based alloys has been evaluated in simulated body fluid using an electrochemical technique and hydrogen evolution. The biocompatibility of the Mg-based alloys has been assessed using SaSO2 cells. Results indicate that the addition of Dy to Mg-Zr-Sr alloy showed a positive impact on the corrosion behavior and significantly decreased the degradation rates of the alloys. The degradation rate of Mg1Zr2Sr1.0Dy decreased from 17.61 to 12.50 mm yearâˆ’1 of Mg1Zr2Sr2.08Dy based on the hydrogen evolution. The ultimate compressive strength decreased from 270.90 MPa for Mg1Zr2Sr1Dy to 236.71 MPa for Mg1Zr2Sr2.08Dy. An increase in the addition of Dy to the Mg-based alloys resulted in an increase in the volume fraction of the Mg2Dy phase, which mitigated the galvanic effect between the Mg17Sr2 phase and the Mg matrix, and led to an increase in the corrosion resistance of the base alloy. The biocompatibility of the Mg-based alloys was enhanced with decreasing corrosion rates. Mg1Zr2Sr2.08Dy exhibited the lowest corrosion rate and the highest biocompatibility compared with the other Mg-based alloys. Â© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"An improved progressive failure modelling and damage tolerant design methodology for composite scarf joints with bondline flaws Adhesive Joints; Aluminum; Araldite There is a lack of understanding on the damage tolerant design of bonded scarf joints, specifically when an existing bondline flaw affects the performance. This paper presents an improved progressive damage modelling methodology for assessing the damage tolerant performance of composite scarf joints containing artificial flaws in the bondline. The developed methodology is validated using an experimental study investigating the influences of design parameters on the strength of scarf joints under quasi-static tensile loading. The presented work gives excellent predictions of joint strength, and significant insight into the initiation, interaction and progression of damage. A new damage tolerant design approach is subsequently proposed for the application of bonded composite scarf joints, particularly in primary aerospace structures. The proposed design approach assesses the state of the stress at the failure-critical regions of adhesive and adherend to inform on damage-tolerant safe design loads, thus improving the future application of bonded composite scarf joints."

An aesthetic-based fitness measure and a framework for guidance of evolutionary design in architecture Grammars; Open Source Product; Computer Aided Manufacturing The authors present an interactive design framework for grammar evolution. A novel aesthetic-based fitness measure was introduced as guidance procedure. One feature of this guidance procedure is the initial input of a reference image. This image provides direction to the evolutionary design process by application of a similarity measure. A case study shows the interactive exploration of a set of 3D-shapes using the presented framework for guidance of evolutionary design in architecture. The aesthetic-based fitness measure combing quantitative and qualitative criteria was applied in this case study to evaluate form and function of architectural design solutions.
"Mobile social networking applications and the 2012 occupy Nigeria protest Social Media; Election Campaigns; Political Communication Previous studies on the use of social media to facilitate participation in protest have examined established democracies or authoritarian regimes. Participation via social media in nascent democracies has been less well documented, e.g. in those countries that democratized between the 1970s and the 1990s, including those that recently returned to democracy from military dictatorship such as Nigeria. This study has been conducted to fill this gap. This study examines the impact of mobile social networking applications (SNA) in the 2012 Occupy Nigeria protest to further understand the use of mobile SNA for digital activism. A face-to-face, paper-based, purposive quantitative survey of student protestors was conducted. Survey results indicate that mobile SNA (WhatsApp, 2go, Eskimi, Facebook, Badoo and YouTube) were mostly used by student protesters to plan, coordinate and document their participation in the 2012 Occupy Nigeria protest. Of the seven platforms analysed, Facebook was the most used for protest purposes while Eskimi increased the likelihood that a student attended the first day of the protest. This article argues that mobile SNA brought about interaction, socialization, collective and connective engagement that was needed to spur such socio-political movement."
"Towards the spectral mapping of plastic debris on beaches Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Floating and washed ashore marine plastic debris (MPD) is a growing environmental challenge. It has become evident that secluded locations including the Arctic, Antarctic, and remote islands are being impacted by plastic pollution generated thousands of kilometers away. Optical remote sensing of MPD is an emerging field that can aid in monitoring remote environments where in-person observation and data collection is not always feasible. Here we evaluate MPD spectral features in the visible to shortwave infrared regions for detecting varying quantities of MPD that have accumulated on beaches using a spectroradiometer. Measurements were taken from a range of in situ MPD accumulations ranging from 0.08% to 7.94% surface coverage. Our results suggest that spectral absorption features at 1215 nm and 1732 nm are useful for detecting varying abundance levels of MPD in a complex natural environment, however other absorption features at 931 nm, 1045 nm and 2046 nm could not detect in situ MPD. The reflectance of some in situ MPD accumulations was statistically different from samples that only contained organic debris and sand between 1.56% and 7.94% surface cover; however other samples with similar surface cover did not have reflectance that was statistically different from samples containing no MPD. Despite MPD being detectable against a background of sand and organic beach debris, a clear relationship between the surface cover of MPD and the strength of key absorption features could not be established. Additional research is needed to advance our understanding of the factors, such as type of MPD assemblage, that contribute to the bulk reflectance of MPD contaminated landscapes."
"Thermal-chemical modified rice husk-based porous adsorbents for Cu (II), Pb (II), Zn (II), Mn (II) and Fe (III) adsorption Iodine Value; Activated Carbon; Adsorption Heavy metal ions contamination, a threat to ecological balance, aquatic life, and human health, co-exists in water bodies and soil systems such as mining sites, tanneries, petrochemical refineries, pesticide, fertilizer, construction, chemical industries, and others. In this study, raw rice husk and potassium hydroxide (KOH) activated novel rice husk (RH)-based adsorbents: potassium hydroxide (KOH) activated RH (KOH-RH), KOH activated RH hydrochar (KOH-RHH), and KOH activated silver (Ag) nanoparticle modified RH (AgNP-KOH-RH) were synthesized and applied on synthetic wastewater to treat hazardous heavy metal ions, Cu2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ through fixed-bed flow column adsorption. Maximum Cu2+, Pb2+, Zn2+ uptake was obtained 7.14 mg/g, 9.02 mg/g and 8.53 mg/g, respectively by KOH-RHH. The maximum Fe3+ and Mn2+ uptake was 1.66 mg/g and 0.98 mg/g, respectively by AgNP-KOH-RH. After 1st run of adsorption, the adsorbents were recovered and re-used for 2nd adsorption run. Maximum Cu2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ uptake was 11.98 mg/g, 9.46 mg/g, 1.29 mg/g, 19.55 mg/g and 14.58 mg/g, respectively obtained by KOH-RHH at 2nd adsorption run. AgNP-KOH-RH obtained the minimum retention time for adsorption and maximum color removal for both runs. Compared with commercial adsorbents such as coconut shell activated carbon, higher heavy metal ions adsorption capacity (>90%) and color removal have been obtained with both KOH-RHH and AgNP-KOH-RH. The adsorption kinetics was well fitted into the intra-particle diffusion (IPD) kinetics model. The detailed characterization of the adsorbents such as surface area, porosity, and surface morphology was conducted for deriving the mechanism. It can be stated that the significant adsorption capacity of heavy metals and color by KOH-RHH and AgNP-KOH-RH with repetitive adsorption runs will provide new insight into adsorption mechanisms and the development of next-generation commercial adsorbents for industrial wastewater treatment."

"Versatility in sustainable building design (SBD) practices: an empirical study Crime Prevention; Burglary; Environmental Design Purpose: Through an empirical study, this research proposes a multi-dimensional assessment method for Sustainable Building Design (SBD). This approach is adopted to investigate and evaluate the current practices of SBD and to provide a basis for refining such processes while reducing existing shortfalls. In doing so, a holistic sustainable framework for rating the sustainable performance of buildings is proposed. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the aforementioned purpose, this research (1) investigates the most current trends in SBD including the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM); (2) examines the practical issues of SBD; (3) proposes a multi-dimensional assessment method; and (4) compares 18 separate case studies in the three countries of Australia, United Kingdom and USA, as part of the SBD implementation. To compare these case studies, an additional SBD tool, Green Building Rating and Certification System (GBELS) was carefully selected and applied. Five core values of SBD were identified based on functionality, accessibility and productivity, which align with the GBELS outcomes. Findings: This research found that, for the 18 examined buildings, the main issues in SBD in the three countries concerned environmental and ecological issues. These included the impacts of buildings on the environment, as well as issues concerning the buildings' life cycle analysis and assessment. It was also determined that energy usage, pollution reduction and climate change concerns were important inclusions in establishing these buildings, particularly in the USA. Originality/value: To support the research aim, this paper explores the most innovative trends in SBD assessments including their Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), grade (stars) classification, Relative Weight (RW) and particularly GBELS. GBELS was selected for this research, since it is relatively new and there is little available literature discussing its adaptation. Accordingly, this research further evaluates the application of GBELS as a part of versatility in SBD multi-dimensional assessment method. As the basis of these tests, a total of 18 separate case studies are closely evaluated."

"Balancing research excellence and media impact: A multistage approach Numerosity; Number Line; Approximate The communication of research in an electronic age presents numerous opportunities to engage with the general public and/or industry that might directly benefit from new findings. The use of social media outlets typically has a narrative of better enabling connection between people, independent of distance or socio-economic factors. Recent USA-based research suggests that despite drops in the frequency of people who trust elected officials or the media to act in the best interests of the public, there remains a constant and considerably higher confidence in scientists. This suggests that direct communication from scientists can enable better public outreach on important issues. Drawing on several well-known historical examples of how high impactful science has been previously conducted and communicated, we provide a model of how combining quality peer review and a multi-stage communication strategy enables effective and constructive communication. Key to this is a capacity to engage with skilled journalists and the general public via several platforms to explain findings in an unambiguous fashion that enables translating the complexity required in a scientific journal into a digestible accurate representation. This model of research communication can enable end users to evaluate, process and apply information without filters that may intentionally bias findings."
"Improvement of anaerobic digestion of sewage mixed sludge using free nitrous acid and Fenton pre-treatment Activated Sludge; Anaerobic Digestion; Pretreatment Background: Recently, it has been indicated that free nitrous acid (FNA) and Fenton pre-treatment of waste activated sludge can enhance methane production in anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge. In addition, it has been revealed that the substances used in these pre-treatments are both eco-friendly and economically attractive because not only are they produced in anaerobic digestion, but they are also low priced. Since primary sludge and waste activated sludge are mixed prior to anaerobic digestion in the majority of wastewater treatment plants, this study aims to assess the influence of combined FNA and Fenton on the anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge. Results: According to this study's results, methane generation from anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge was enhanced when using FNA and Fenton pre-treatment, affirming the effectiveness of the individual and combined pre-treatments in anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge. The enhanced methane production was significant in combined pre-treatments (up to 72%), compared with FNA and Fenton pre-treatment alone (25% and 27%, respectively). This corroborates the positive synergistic effect of the combined pre-treatments on methane production. The enhanced methane can be attributed to augmented soluble fractions of organic matter in addition to increased readily biodegradable organic matter, caused by the pre-treatments. Additionally, the amount of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was assessed during anaerobic digestion, and it was revealed that COD decreased considerably when the pre-treatment strategies were combined. Conclusions: This study reveals that the pre-treatments are potentially applicable to full-scale wastewater treatment plants because a mixture of primary sludge and waste activated sludge was used for the pre-treatments. Additionally, combined FNA and Fenton pre-treatments prove more effective in enhancing methane production and organic removal than these pre-treatments alone. The enhanced methane production is important for two reasons: a higher amount of renewable energy could be generated from the enhanced methane production and the COD of digested sludge reduces in such a way that facilitates application of the sludge to agricultural lands and reduces sludge transport costs."
"Elite capture of local participatory governance Citizen Participation; Local Government; Publicity Elite capture is a major barrier to citizen engagement in local governance processes in many developing countries. Data from six case studies of development initiatives in Bangladesh show that, in spite of attempts by aid donors and others to ensure citizen participation, programmes are dominated by a nexus of local elites including MPs and bureaucrats. Local stakeholders do not understand the value that direct citizen participation can bring, and citizens are unaware of their rights and wary of challenging elites. Monitoring of requirements for citizen participation is weak, and the management of some programmes deters participation. Representatives are sometimes selected by elites and legal frameworks are not sufficiently strong or enforced consistently. We conclude that a range of additional and effectively implemented policy measures are required to reduce the extent and effects of elite capture in developing countries."
"Internal biliary drainage superior to external biliary drainage in improving gut mucosa barrier because of goblet cells and mucin-2 up-regulation Ampulla of Vater; Duodenal Neoplasms; Adenoma Backgroud: Obstructive jaundice increases intestinal permeability, but the pathological mechanisms remain obscure, which results in debates about the necessity of performing preoperative biliary drainage in patients with obstructive jaundice. Mucin-2 (MUC2) and goblet cells regulated by bile acids play an important role in maintaining the function of intestinal mucosal barrier. The present study was to investigate the role of goblet cells and MUC2 in obstructive jaundice and evaluate the effect of biliary drainage on intestinal permeability. Study design: We enrolled patients with malignant biliary obstruction and controls. We also did animal studies with four groups of rats: sham operation, obstructive jaundice, internal biliary drainage, and external biliary drainage. Histopathological analysis, biochemical measurement, and electron microscopy examination were done on pertinent samples. Results: Compared with the control group, the small intestinal mucosa was significantly damaged; goblet cells and MUC2 were significantly decreased and serum endotoxin level was significantly increased in patients and rats with obstructive jaundice. Biliary drainage, especially internal biliary drainage, significantly increased goblet cells and MUC2 and attenuated the damage of small intestinal mucosa. Conclusions: In obstructive jaundice condition, goblet cells and MUC2 were reduced which were involved in the damage of intestinal mucosa barrier; biliary drainage increased goblet cells and MUC2, repaired mucosa layer and restored the intestinal mucosa barrier function."
"Analysis of production safety in the construction industry of China in 2018 Construction Safety; Occupational Accidents; Accident Construction accidents are a significant hazard to the community, affecting sustainable development. This paper summarizes the safety situation of the construction industry in China over the past ten years. Detailed analysis is performed on fatal accidents that occurred in 2018 to reveal the spatiotemporal distribution pattern and characters of construction safety accidents. The construction failures are mainly attributed to management aspects rather than technical aspects. A case involving a major accident during shield tunnel construction in Foshan, Guangdong, in 2018 is investigated in detail. Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is used to analyze the management issues of the Foshan metro project during planning, geological investigation, design, and implementation of construction works. The SEA result shows that the safety risk was very high with a low total SEA score. Based on the analysis, a guideline for safety construction management for sustainability is proposed."
"A Triphenylamine–Naphthalenediimide–Fullerene Triad: Synthesis, Photoinduced Charge Separation and Solution-Processable Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells Polymer Solar Cells; Polymers; Organic Photovoltaics A new naphthalenediimide (NDI) derivative linked to triphenylamine (TPA) and fullerene (TPAâ€“NDIâ€“C60 triad; S3) was designed, synthesized and characterized. Femtosecond laser transient absorption spectral measurements revealed that fast electron transfer from TPA to the singlet-excited state of NDI occurred to form a charge-separated state (TPA.+â€“NDI.âˆ’â€“C60) with a rate constant of approximately 1012 sâˆ’1, followed by the charge-shift reaction from NDI.âˆ’ to C60 to produce the charge-separated state (TPA.+â€“NDIâ€“C60 .âˆ’) that decayed by back electron transfer with a rate constant of 4.4Ã—109 sâˆ’1 (with a corresponding lifetime of 230 ps). Organic bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated using the triad S3 as an n-type semiconductor along with the conventional donor polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene). The power conversion efficiency reached 3.03 % before annealing and 4.85 % after annealing in the optimized devices. To rationalize the performance of these organic photovoltaic devices, atomic force microscopy was used to study the morphology of poly(3-hexylthiophene):S3 blend surfaces, which were found to be well interlaced and free from projections, lumps, or indentations."
"Remediation of resins-contaminated soil by the combination of electrokinetic and bioremediation processes Electrokinetics; Contaminated Soil; Remediation In this work, soil contaminated by petroleum resins was remediated by electrokinetic-bioremediation (EK-BIO) technology for 60 days. A microbial consortium, comprising Rhizobium sp., Arthrobacter globiformis, Clavibacter xyli, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus sp., was used to enhance the treatment performance. The results indicate that resin removal and phytotoxicity reduction were highest in the inoculated EK process, wherein 23.6% resins was removed from the soil and wheat seed germination ratio was increased from 47% to around 90% after treatment. The microbial counts, soil basal respiration and dehydrogenase activity were positively related to resins degradation, and they could be enhanced by direct current electric field. After remediation, the C/H ratio of resins decreased from 8.03 to 6.47. Furthermore, the structure of resins was analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) before and after treatment. It was found that the changes of the structure of resins took place during EK-BIO treatment and finally led to the reduction of aromaticity, aromaticity condensation and phytotoxicity."
"Building capacity for a user‐centred integrated early warning system for drought in Papua New Guinea Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China Drought has significant impacts on the agricultural productivity and wellâ€being of Pacific Island communities. In this study, a userâ€centred integrated early warning system (Iâ€EWS) for drought was investigated for Papua New Guinea (PNG). The Iâ€EWS combines satellite products (Standardised Precipitation Index and Vegetation Health Index) with seasonal probabilistic forecasting outputs (chance of exceeding median rainfall). Internationally accepted drought thresholds for each of these inputs are conditionally combined to trigger three drought early warning stagesâ€” â€DROUGHT WATCHâ€, â€œDROUGHT ALERTâ€ and â€œDROUGHT EMERGENCYâ€. The developed Iâ€ EWS for drought was used to examine the evolution of a strong El NiÃ±oâ€induced drought event in 2015 as well as a weaker La NiÃ±aâ€induced dry period in 2020. Examining the evolution of drought early warnings at a provincial level, it was found that tailored warning lead times of 3â€“5 months could have been possible for several impacted PNG provinces. These lead times would enable in-creasingly proactive drought responses with the potential for prioritised allocation of funds at a provincial level. The methodology utilised within this study uses inputs that are openly and freely available globally which indicates promising potential for adaptation of the developed userâ€centred Iâ€EWS in other Pacific Island Countries that are vulnerable to drought."

A novel translator of a multiple degree of freedom non-linear oscillator system built with the Halbach ring array pattern and ferro-fluid bearings is the key innovation. Wave energy conversion science will be established through investigating the novel machine, its integration with a buoy structure under wave loadings and automatic control of power conversion and conditioning. The outcome will meet the emerging demands of the nation for wave energy conversion technologies which reduce power generation cost and emissions, thus benefiting the Australia economy and environment."
"Emerging sustainable solutions for depollution: Geopolymers Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali Air pollution and water pollution are critical issues because they negatively affect ecosystem and human health, as well as affecting buildings and industries. Utilizing photocatalysts that rely on light irradiation to decompose pollutants is a promising solution to this issue. Geopolymers, when used as a green substitute for cement and other engineered materials, can be synthesized using different agricultural and industrial wastes. These materials exhibit synergies in the depollution process and can be regarded as cost effective and novel in the context of removing organic pollution from water and air to protect and improve the environment. Geopolymer catalytic performance is closely linked to the composition, microstructure, and preparation method of the geopolymer. This review investigates the types of geopolymers and catalysts and their corresponding preparation methods and performances. The limitations of these products and future works are also detailed."

"Microwave hydrothermal carbonization of rice straw: Optimization of process parameters and upgrading of chemical, fuel, structural and thermal properties Hydrothermal Carbonization; Hydrochars; Carbon The process parameters of microwave-induced hydrothermal carbonization (MIHTC) play an important role on the hydrothermal chars (hydrochar) yield. The effect of reaction temperature, reaction time, particle size and biomass to water ratio was optimized for hydrochar yield by modeling using the central composite design (CCD). Further, the rice straw and hydrochar at optimum conditions have been characterized for energy, chemical, structural and thermal properties. The optimum condition for hydrochar synthesis was found to be at a 180 Â°C reaction temperature, a 20 min reaction time, a 1:15 weight per volume (w/v) biomass to water ratio and a 3 mm particle size, yielding 57.9% of hydrochar. The higher heating value (HHV), carbon content and fixed carbon values increased from 12.3 MJ/kg, 37.19% and 14.37% for rice straw to 17.6 MJ/kg, 48.8% and 35.4% for hydrochar. The porosity, crystallinity and thermal stability of the hydrochar were improved remarkably compared to rice straw after MIHTC. Two characteristic peaks from XRD were observed at 2Î¸ of 15Â° and 26Â°, whereas DTG peaks were observed at 50-150 Â°C and 300-350 Â°C for both the materials. Based on the results, it can be suggested that the hydrochar could be potentially used for adsorption, carbon sequestration, energy and agriculture applications."
"Predicted environmental concentration and fate of the top 10 most dispensed Australian prescription pharmaceuticals PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs A basic environmental risk assessment was carried out for the top 10 dispensed pharmaceuticals in Melbourne, Australia, in contrast to the more commonly assessed measure of the most used drugs by physical mass. This allowed for the evaluation of compounds that had not previously been the subject of risk assessment. Estimations of the possible fate and behaviour of the target pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants were also made. The predicted removal rates of most drugs within standard sewage treatment were expected to be low, with the exception of the statins, which had high removal rates. Each pharmaceutical was predicted to be present in Melbourne wastewater at the nanogram per litre range or lower. All compounds were predicted to be of low toxicity risk, although it was not possible to model mixture effects. Atorvastatin and Irbesartan were also found to possess the potential to possibly bioaccumulate in the aquatic food chain but not to the extent that would require regulation or labelling."

"Using the ReSOLVE framework for circularity in the building and construction industry in emerging markets Industrial Symbiosis; Sustainable Development; Circular Economy Circularity supports the move from linear to circular systems where more efficient, zero waste systems are created by closing material inputs and loops. The design, maintenance, manufacturing and use ensure virgin materials are no longer needed for day to day living. For the built environment sector, building materials and its use underpins the trajectory of circularity in the sector. Improved building materials, increased standardization and appropriate storage and transportation may reduce waste. Increased adaptability and multi-use spaces in buildings support multiple occupants and end users. This paper focuses on understanding the requirements to move to a circular pathway for the building and construction sector in emerging markets, using secondary literature and case studies. The ReSOLVE framework developed by Arup and Ellen MacArthur Foundation consists of Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop, Virtualise and Exchange to support circularity in the built environment. Not just the building materials themselves and advanced techniques of construction, but also new business models are required so that the socioeconomic system may also support circularity approaches. Increased digitalisation also supports the adoption of circular opportunities. Emerging economies globally need to consider circular approaches to meet the current and future demands of climate change mitigation and adaptation."

"Flood Exposure Assessment and Mapping: A Case Study for Australia’s Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment Flood Damage; Flooding; Natural Hazards Floods are the most common and costliest natural disaster in Australia. However, the Flood Risk Assessments (FRAs) employed to manage them are hazard-focused and tend to overlook exposure and vulnerability. This leaves potential for Australian FRAs to make better use of a technique which holistically incorporates all three flood risk components. In this study, flood exposure assessment and mapping for the Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment (HNC), a flood-prone region in Australia, was conducted. Three flood exposure indicatorsâ€”population density, land use type, and critical infrastructure densityâ€”were selected to derive the flood exposure index (FEI). Results demonstrated that Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2s) on or near the floodplain, located near the eastern border of the HNC, are severely or extremely flood-exposed due to the significant presence of flood-exposed assets such as hospitals or police stations. The Wahroonga (West)â€”Waitara SA2 was the most exposed SA2 in the catchment (extreme exposure). This was followed by the Acacia Gardens, Glendenningâ€”Dean Park, and Cambridge Park SA2s (all severely exposed). The Goulburn SA2 was also identified as severely flood-exposed even though it remains outside of the floodplain. This is due to its many exposed assets as Australiaâ€™s first inland town. All selected indicators were found to either strongly or moderately positively correlate with the FEI. Ultimately, this novel FEI can assist in the reduction of flood risk in the HNC, as well as foster community resilience strategies. Additionally, the developed scalable and replicable methodology can be applied to other flood-prone regions of Australia."
"Enhancing Toughness of Medium-Density Fiberboard by Mimicking Nacreous Structures through Advanced Manufacturing Techniques Nacre; Mechanical Properties; Bio-Inspired Medium-density fiberboard (MDF) is widely used in building construction. Due to its inherent brittleness, MDF is typically employed in nonstructural components such as partition walls. Many structures found in nature are also composed of brittle materials, but their unique structural arrangements provide superior mechanical performance to traditional engineering construction. An excellent example is nacre, a tough component of the armor system of mollusk seashells. The masonrylike structure of nacre is mainly composed of a brittle ceramic mineral, but its toughness is several orders of magnitude greater than aragonite. Herein, MDF is toughened using principles inspired by nacre. Several of the structural features of nacre are mimicked, namely (1) the polygonal bricks and reinforcing bridges between them to control strength, and (2) the highly deformable polymeric mortar to control toughness. The process of manufacturing the nacrelike MDF composite panel is automated using a computer-generated Voronoi geometry and laser cutting. The performance of the nacrelike panel is experimentally assessed under quasi-static tensile loading. The bridges between the bricks controlled the strength of the specimen, and the crack tortuosity between the oblique edges of the polygonal bricks and the ductile polymeric adhesive enhanced its toughness. The improved strength and toughness of the MDF should inspire other studies to broaden the application of biomimetic composites to extreme environments requiring strong and tough materials."
"Data-Driven Based Prediction of the Energy Consumption of Residential Buildings in Oshawa Load Forecasting; Prediction; Energy Model Buildings consume about 40% of the global energy. Building energy consumption is affected by multiple factors, including building physical properties, performance of the mechanical system, and occupantsâ€™ activities. The prediction of building energy consumption is very complicated in actual practice. Accurate and fast prediction of the building energy consumption is very important in building design optimization and sustainable energy development. This paper evaluates 24 energy consumption models for 83 houses in Oshawa, Canada. The energy consumption, social and demographic information of the occupants, and the physical properties of the houses were collected through smart metering, a phone survey, and an energy audit. A total of 63 variables were determined, and based on the variable importance, three groups with different numbers of variables were selected, i.e., 26, 12, and 6 for electricity consumption; and 26, 13, and 6 for gas consumption. A total of eight data-driven algorithms, namely Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Stepwise Regression (SR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFN), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID), and Exhaustive CHAID (ECHAID), were used to develop energy prediction models. The results show that the BPNN model has the best accuracies in predicting both the annual electricity consumption and gas consumption, with mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of 0.94% and 0.94% for training and validation data for electricity consumption, and 2.63% and 0.16% for gas consumption, respectively."
"A mesoporous biochar from bio-invasion alligator weed for adsorption of rhodamine B from aqueous solution Biosorbents; Congo Red; Adsorption Alligator weed, a malignant invasive weed worldwide, was used to prepare a low-cost and effective alligator weed biochar (AWBC) that adsorbs rhodamine B from aqueous solution. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that AWBC has a rough surface with a highly porous structure, a high surface area (736.3 m2/g) and an abundant array of micropores and mesopores. The average pore size was 4.05 nm, which is predicted to improve the activated carbon adsorption performance of macromol-ecules and small molecule particles. Phosphorus-containing groups, Câ€“H, Câ€“O, and C=C moieties were present on the AWBC surface. Kinetic data obtained from three pollutants that were adsorbed by AWBC fit with a pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R2 > 0.99), and this was considered as the rate-limiting factor for adsorption. The batch equilibrium data fitted well to the Langmuir isotherm (R2 > 0.99), revealing monolayer adsorption and an adsorption capacity of 286 mg/g (R2 > 0.99). Negative Î”G values confirmed the spontaneity of the adsorption process, and positive Î”H and Î”S values indicated endothermic and irreversible adsorption."
"Towards Sustainable Environmental Quality: Priority Research Questions for the Australasian Region of Oceania Ethinylestradiol; Endocrine Disruptors; Wastewater Treatment Environmental challenges persist across the world, including the Australasian region of Oceania, where biodiversity hotspots and unique ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef are common. These systems are routinely affected by multiple stressors from anthropogenic activities, and increasingly influenced by global megatrends (e.g., the foodâ€“energyâ€“water nexus, demographic transitions to cities) and climate change. Here we report priority research questions from the Global Horizon Scanning Project, which aimed to identify, prioritize, and advance environmental quality research needs from an Australasian perspective, within a global context. We employed a transparent and inclusive process of soliciting key questions from Australasian members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. Following submission of 78 questions, 20 priority research questions were identified during an expert workshop in Nelson, New Zealand. These research questions covered a range of issues of global relevance, including research needed to more closely integrate ecotoxicology and ecology for the protection of ecosystems, increase flexibility for prioritizing chemical substances currently in commerce, understand the impacts of complex mixtures and multiple stressors, and define environmental quality and ecosystem integrity of temporary waters. Some questions have specific relevance to Australasia, particularly the uncertainties associated with using toxicity data from exotic species to protect unique indigenous species. Several related priority questions deal with the theme of how widely international ecotoxicological data and databases can be applied to regional ecosystems. Other timely questions, which focus on improving predictive chemistry and toxicology tools and techniques, will be important to answer several of the priority questions identified here. Another important question raised was how to protect local cultural and social values and maintain indigenous engagement during problem formulation and identification of ecosystem protection goals. Addressing these questions will be challenging, but doing so promises to advance environmental sustainability in Oceania and globally."

"Moving from the millennium to the sustainable development goals: Lessons and recommendations Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations Introduction With the introduction of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), perhaps the most important questions on the minds of most policymakers is whether the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were successful and what factors may have influenced their achievement. Answering these questions is important for assessing the ongoing progress of the SDGs and identifying key policy areas to focus on. This important edited collection examines various dimensions of the MDGs and development goals more generally, from socioeconomic factors to institutional, financial and more. The authors provide lessons and recommendations for attaining the Sutainable Development Goals that will be relevant to academics, development policymakers and practitioners, as well as NGOs, development agencies and students."
"The UVA response of enolic dibenzoylmethane: Beyond the static approach Density Functional Theory; Enols; Hydrogen Bonds Enolic dibenzoylmethane is used in cosmetic sunscreens as a UVA filter because it strongly absorbs radiation around 340 nm. Assessing the absorption properties solely on the basis of the vertical excitation spectrum at the minimum of the potential energy surface leads to the conclusion that the nÏ€âˆ— state is not initially photoexcited. Since this molecule exhibits large changes in structure due to nuclear thermal and quantum fluctuations, it is not sufficient to consider one molecular configuration but an ensemble of configurations. In this work, we simulate its UVA response by employing the DFT/MRCI method in conjunction with configurations sampled from density functional theory-based classical and path integral molecular dynamics as well as by computing Franck-Condon factors. Our findings indicate that thermal and nuclear quantum fluctuations symmetrically broaden the excited states' absorption within the semi-classical approximation and thus it is necessary to include vibronic effects in order to correctly reproduce the experimental spectrum. The absorption is largely dominated by the Ï€Ï€âˆ— state but there is a minor contribution from the nÏ€âˆ— state, contrary to the static result. The crossing between these two states occurs during the intramolecular proton transfer. This knowledge is of importance for studying photorelaxation mechanisms of dibenzoylmethane and other Î²-diketone compounds."
"Adaptive governance in carbon farming policies Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework This book discusses a variety of different perspectives involved in biodiversity management and bio-sequestration projects in Australia, working towards achieving adaptive governance in carbon farming. It not only examines landholders' motivation but also the challenges of integrating biodiverse forests into the agricultural landscape. Drawing on the contrast between science and policy stakeholders' views on carbon farming and the practical challenges of achieving adaptive governance, the book discusses the significant gap between theory and practice encountered in this field of study. The book suggests ways of improving the decision-making capacity of government officials and policymakers involved in managing carbon and biodiversity markets, as well as introducing measures to promote adaptive governance by engaging landholders in more effective land conservation. Climate change is a pressing issue on the global political agenda, and this book makes an important contribution to the ongoing debate. This book will be an invaluable reference for practitioners, policymakers and researchers interested in alternative forms of governance in natural resource management."
"Ergonomic considerations for designing truck drivers' seats: The case of Bangladesh Period Prevalence; Furniture; Anthropometry Objectives: The purpose of this work was to investigate the fitness of the existing truck seats for Bangladeshi truck drivers and suggest a guideline for drivers' seats based on their anthropometry. Methodology: In this study, eight anthropometric measurements of 120 Bangladeshi truck drivers and seven seat dimensions of ninety trucks of three brands namely, TATA, ASHOK LEYLAND, and ISUZU were considered for investigating the considerable mismatch between seat dimensions and drivers' anthropometry. The data were analyzed using two-sample t-tests to identify the relationship between existing seat dimensions and drivers' anthropometry. Results: The results showed a mismatch in seat dimensions and anthropometric measurements for nearly all truck brands and the existing seat dimensions were found to be inappropriate for Bangladeshi drivers. For all the truck brands, the percentage mismatch of seat height, seat depth, seat width, backrest height, and steering wheel clearance varied between 71% and 98%, 23% and 79%, 33% and 84%, 28% and 65%, and 53% and 100% respectively. Subsequently, an attempt was made to provide ergonomically correct seat dimensions for Bangladeshi truck drivers. Further, generalized equations to design the appropriate seat dimensions were developed using the least square regression technique. The recommended seat height, depth and width, backrest height, and steering wheel clearance were found to be appropriate for 82%, 79%, 76%, 98%, and 100% of drivers respectively. Conclusion: The analysis and results of this study can be useful in developing guidelines for design and manufacture of truck driver seats in Bangladesh."
"Blockchain Technology: Potential Applications for Public Sector E-Procurement and Project Management Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things Project implementations normally fail due to sustainable development problems that inhibit the usage levels required to facilitate successful implementations. This paper explores the successful implementation from a Bangladesh perspective. In particular, it identifies the possible applications of Blockchain in project procurement and management, and it develops a guideline for incorporating Blockchain into project management to improve the existing project and the procurement management practices in developing countries. This is a qualitative study with an interpretivist research methodology. By adopting an interpretive approach, this study construes knowledge as that only gained through social constructions, such as language, shared meanings, documents, industry reports, reviews of academic papers, and tools; it is a changing and relative phenomenon. This study reveals that developing countries are suffering in terms of the development of projects, including poor project management, a lack of transparency, poor procurement management, etc. A total of 38 issues were identified through this study, which are the main barriers to the successful implementation of public sector projects. One of the main reasons is due to the practice of awarding the lowest bidder during the procurement process due to the current regulatory requirements. This paper found that the Oracle platform, built on Blockchain technology as a cloud-computing platform, is one of the prominent E-procurement platforms that provides both the Blockchain platform and the cloud-based applications. Therefore, after observing and analysing the platform, it is found that Blockchain technology has the capability to resolve 25 issues out of 38 identified issues."

"Using measures of efficiency for regionally-targeted smallholder policy intervention: The case of Pakistan's horticulture sector Agriculture; Stochastic Frontier Model; Metafrontier The empirical literature on the sources of production efficiency mostly focuses on technical and scale efficiency, and the relative importance of mix efficiency is often overlooked. This paper estimates input-oriented technical and mix efficiency using a farm-level survey dataset of 730 smallholder horticulture farms in Pakistan. We estimate a Bayesian stochastic production frontier model to draw precise statistical inferences by using finite sample properties. We find that the estimated mean mix inefficiency (0.65) is roughly as large as mean technical inefficiency (0.64). Moreover, we detect large technical and mix efficiency disparities across agro-climatic zones and farm sizes, which we attribute to suboptimal farm practices. We conclude that policy-makers should focus on strategies that target to improve both technical and mix inefficiency."
"Engaging with artificial intelligence (AI) with a bottom-up approach for the purpose of sustainability: Victorian farmers market association, Melbourne Australia Machine Ethics; Artificial Intelligence; Roboethics Artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting all aspects of food systems, including production, food processing, distribution, and consumption. AI, if implemented ethically for sustainability, can enhance biodiversity, conserve water and energy resources, provide land-related services, power smart cities, and help mitigate climate change. However, there are significant issues in using AI to transition to sustainable food systems. AIâ€™s own carbon footprint could cancel out any sustainability benefits that it creates. Additionally, the technology could further entrench inequalities between and within countries, and bias against minorities or less powerful groups. This paper draws on findings from a study of the Victorian Farmersâ€™ Markets Association (VFMA) that investigated the complexity of designing AI tools to enhance sustainability and resilience for the benefit of the organisation and its members. Codesign workshops, both synchronous and asynchronous, semi-structured interviews, and design innovation methods led the VFMA to experiment with an AI tool to link sustainable soil practices, nutrient rich produce, and human health. The analysis shows that the codesign process and an agile approach created a co-learning environment where sustainability and ethical questions could be considered iteratively within transdisciplinary engagement. The bottom-up approach developed through this study supports organisations who want to engage with AI while reinforcing fairness, transparency, and sustainability."
"A new criterion for comfort assessment of in-wheel motor electric vehicles Vibration; Tractors (Agricultural); Office Chair A novel optimization technique was implemented to investigate the effects of vibrations on comfort of occupants to maintain oscillations in an acceptable zone in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization 2631 standard. In this regard, a newly introduced comfort indicator was defined as discomfort criterion (DiC). The effectiveness of the proposed measure was investigated throughout the suspension optimization of an in-wheel motor electric vehicle which almost doubled the unsprung mass by adding an electric motor to the wheel assembly. First, a spatial oscillatory model of the electric vehicle with eight degrees of freedom was developed, and the linear quadratic regulator control scheme is selected to control an actuator in an active suspension. Road excitations were then generated by applying the power spectral density of road class Bâ€“C provided by the International Organization for Standardization 8608 standard. The exceedance from the reduced comfort limit (in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization 2631 standard) and wheel travel (WT) of the vehicle were considered as design objectives. Finally, using a novel optimization procedure, the optimum condition and impact factor of the design variables, as well as counterplots of the design objectives with respect to the effective design parameters, were extracted and analyzed. Results proved the proposed indicator, that is, discomfort criterion (DiC) as a reliable measure to assess suspension systemsâ€™ performance effectively."

"Reducing tumour incidence in adolescents with germ-line mutations in RECQL4 (Administered by St Vincents Hospital) This proposal addresses Stream 2: Cancer in adolescents.
Substantiating evidence of direct relevance to grant call: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common cancer of bone, with a peak incidence during late childhood and adolescence. OS affects 3.4 people per million each year (2.7-4.3; 95% CI) in Australia, with its incidence increasing 1.1% annually between 1983-2015 (1). For patients with localised disease, 5-year survival rates have stagnated at 70% and no substantive changes to treatment (conventional chemotherapy and surgery) have been achieved for greater than three decades (2).
Patients with metastatic or relapsed OS currently have a 20-30% 5-yr survival rate (3), and there is an urgent need to identify new therapeutics for this cohort. Whole genome sequencing and exome capture have transformed our understanding of the genetics of conventional human OS, with the universal mutation of TP53 accompanied by recurrent mutation of RB1, ATRX and DLG2 in 29-53% of cases (4-6). However, to date no clinically actionable targets have been defined using these approaches."

"Factors influencing the concentration of fecal coliforms in oysters in the river Blackwater Estuary, UK Bacteroidales; Seashore; Fecal Bacterium Contamination of water systems can not only entail high risks to human health but can also result in economic losses due to closure of beaches and shellfish harvesting areas. Understanding the origin of fecal pollution at locations where shellfish are grown is essential in assessing associated health risks-as well as the determining actions necessary to remedy the problem. The aim of this work is to identify the species-specific source(s) of fecal contamination impacting waters overlying the shellfisheries in the Blackwater Estuary, East Anglia, UK. Over a twelve-month period, water samples were taken from above the oysters and from a variety of upstream points considered to be likely sources of fecal microorganism, together with oyster samples, and the number of fecal streptococci and E. coli were determined. Transition from low to high tide significantly decreased the concentration of fecal streptococci in waters overlying the oyster beds, indicative of a freshwater input of fecal pollution in oyster bed waters. In 12 months, the number of E. coli remained constant throughout, while fecal streptococci numbers were generally higher in the winter months. Analyses of upstream samples identified a sewage outfall to be the main source of E. coli to the oyster beds, with additional fecal streptococci from agricultural sources. The findings may assist in developing approaches for assessing the risks to shellfishery industries of various fecal inputs into an estuary, which could then help local governmental authorities address the problem."
"A low-cost treatment system for underground water using Moringa oleifera seeds and Musa cavendish peels for remote communities Biosorption; Isotherms; Aqueous Solution BACKGROUND: Nemours plant-based biomass exhibit higher removal capacities in comparison to chemical treatment methods. The present study aimed to investigate the potential of Moringa oleifera (MO) seeds and Musa cavendish (MC) peel biomass pre-treated by HNO3 (1 N) and NaOH (0.1 M) for removing nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) ions from synthetic groundwater. It further aimed to establish the design and test the efficiency of an individual domestic groundwater treatment system with low-cost using local materials. The batch tests with biomass (MC, MO and MC + MO) were conducted at pH 7. Adsorption was investigated using Freundlich and Langmuir models for single elements, and the Sheindorfâ€“Rebhunâ€“Sheintuch (SRS) model for multicontaminant elements. By contrast, the simulation of actual groundwater quality was studied using a Monte Carlo simulation model. RESULTS: The adsorption results fitted with the Freundlich model revealed that â‰ˆ91%, 98% and 84% of groundwater samples met WHO standards for Pb2+, Ni2+ and Cd2+, respectively. The FTIR analysis of MC, MO and MC + MO revealed that C-C, C-O and N-H were the main functional groups playing roles in the removal of heavy metals from the water samples. The mechanism of adsorption took place by chemisorption and physisorption. The total cost of the water treatment system with a capacity of 50 L was US$17, and considered suitable for remote, lower income communities. CONCLUSION: The MC + MO biomass was efficient in adsorbing heavy metal ions from water samples owing to the presence of abundant functional groups."

"Renewable energy adoption in the built environment: a sociotechnical network approach Hot Temperature; Phase Change Materials; Photovoltaic System The transition to renewable energy system in the building industry is a complex process comprising various technology elements and influenced by multiple stakeholders and various functions. Without unravelling how technical systems are embedded with social components, the opportunity for successful implementation is compromised. Therefore, this paper examines the influence of sociotechnical elements on renewable energy uptake in the building industry. This study adopts a sociotechnical network perspective and proposes a meta-network analysis (multi-link and multi-node network) to assess complex sociotechnical systems and uses an example of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) uptake to demonstrate the approach. A comprehensive literature review and 20 interviews assisted in the development of the sociotechnical network. The adoption process is transformed to a three-node network,with nodes as social actors, technical artefacts and actions (drivers that influence the deployment). The findings reveal significant sociotechnical elements as adopters/clients: governments, BIPV panels, energy storage systems and the building. The system performances, uniform standards, regulations and building codes, stakeholder collaborations, incentives and upfront cost are highlighted as critical drivers influencing deployment. The goal of the study is to inform practitioners and researchers how social and technical dynamics shape successful renewable energy transition in the building sector."

"An online soil nitrogen content monitoring system using gas sensor technology Soil nitrogen content (SNC) is an important indicator which strongly correlates with the crop yield and greenhouse gas emissions. The effective monitoring of SNC can also minimise over-fertilization which is a ubiquitous problem in Australia and China. So far the measurements are mainly based on optical, radiometric and electrochemical platforms. However, these technologies are yet capable of applied widely in farmland due to their relatively high cost and non-continuous measurement nature. 
The correlation between nitrogen fertilizers and nitrous oxide gas emission provides a strong base to use low-cost gas sensor networks for monitoring SNC in a real-time and online manner. This project will involve the collaboration between RMIT University (Australia) and Intelirri Technology Co., Ltd., (China) to apply the patented nitrous oxide physisorption gas sensor technology (RMIT) into the smart wireless agriculture platform (Intelirri Technology) to develop the world?s first real-time and online SNC monitoring system.

"Eco-friendly design of Warm mix asphalt (WMA) with recycled concrete aggregate (RCA): A case study from a developing country Asphalt Mixtures; Rutting; Asphalt Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) is a type of asphalt concrete with growing notoriety in the paving industry since they generate economic and environmental benefits compared to traditional alternatives. Various techniques have been studied to maximize the sustainability components present in WMAs, including the Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) inclusion as a partial replacement for virgin aggregates. WMA with various RCA contents has been examined in several case studies from the mechanical, performance, and economic perspectives. Nonetheless, thorough environmental studies have so far been limited, mostly assuming that the use of RCA reduces the environmental burden due to being a recycled product. However, this consideration is not entirely correct since RCA increases the optimal asphalt content. Therefore, excessive RCA contents generate a counterproductive environmental effect. The difficulty associated with the estimate of how much RCA is considered detrimental could explain why detailed environmental evaluations have not been developed on this type of material. This study develops a trade-off methodology based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique and statistical analysis to determine the maximum RCA content to be incorporated into WMA without generating greater environmental impacts. The main contributions of this investigation to the literature are establishing the first approach to optimize the design of WMA with RCA inclusion and identifying the variables that directly affect the contaminating potential of this type of asphalt mixture."
"Si: Survivability under overheating: The impact of regional and global climate change on the vulnerable and low-income population Heat Wave; Climate Change; Distributed Lag The present special issue discusses three significant challenges of the built environment, namely regional and global climate change, vulnerability, and survivability under the changing climate. Synergies between local climate change, energy consumption of buildings and energy poverty, and health risks highlight the necessity to develop mitigation strategies to counterbalance overheating impacts. The studies presented here assess the underlying issues related to urban overheating. Further, the impacts of temperature extremes on the low-income population and increased morbidity and mortality have been discussed. The increasing intensity, duration, and frequency of heatwaves due to human-caused climate change is shown to affect underserved populations. Thus, housing policies on resident exposure to intra-urban heat have been assessed. Finally, opportunities to mitigate urban overheating have been proposed and discussed."
"Influenced or to be influenced: Engaging social media influencers in nation branding through the lens of authenticity Destination; Public Diplomacy; Brand Identity Social media influencers are emerging as a new force in shaping public discourse and raising public awareness of socio-political agendas in the digital space. This paper explores the role of influencers as part of the citizens group in nation branding by looking into their interactions with followers through the lens of authenticity. It analyzes the networked narratives generated by the influencers and followers, using the mixed methods of blending content analysis with social network analysis. The findings identify the potential of influencers evolving as a crucial force in contributing to a representative national brand informed through imbuing authenticity with engagement, featuring valued-based content, interactivity, creativity and intrinsic motivations within an ethical communication mechanism. It advances influencer studies in nation branding by underpinning the two-way construct of authenticity in generating influence; and informs the development of strategies for engaging citizens in nation branding through influencers using authenticity. Considering the central role of China in international economics, politics and culture, this article has significant domestic and regional implications."

"Australian birds could benefit from predator exclusion fencing Dingoes; Mammals; Vulpes Vulpes The use of predator exclusion fencing is widely recognized as one of the most effective mechanisms for protecting threatened fauna from introduced or overabundant predators. It is now used throughout the world to protect avian fauna. In Australia, where predator exclusion fencing is used extensively to protect threatened mammals, such fences for threatened avifauna are surprisingly sparse. In this perspective we demonstrate that (a) the use of predator exclusion fences for avifauna is popular in other countries with similar conservation problems, (b) a large number of Australian avian species could benefit from dedicated predator exclusion fences, and (c) despite legitimate concerns, if well designed, predator exclusion fences can pose little risk to threatened birds or are outweighed by the potential benefits. We believe wider use of predator exclusion fencing to protect Australian threatened birds could be highly beneficial and should be more regularly considered as a management action by conservation practitioners."

"Direct contact membrane distillation for effective concentration of perfluoroalkyl substances – Impact of surface fouling and material stability Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ecotoxic amphiphilic compounds containing alkyl-fluorinated chains terminated with weak acid moieties, and hence difficult to be degraded or removed from water sources. Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) was used for concentrating and removing of perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) compounds from model contaminated water using commercially available poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) membranes. The membranes were characterised for surface morphology, roughness, contact angle and pore size distribution before and after the DCMD test to investigate and evaluate membrane fouling. During the DCMD test performed for 6 h using 10 ppm PFPeA solution, the membrane exhibited progressive increased flux (from 17 to 43 kg mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1) and decreased PFPeA rejection (from 85 to 58%), as the feed temperature was increased from 50 to 70 Â°C. Further, the feed/retentate side showed a 1.8, 2.1 and 2.8-fold increase in PFPeA concentration tested at feed temperatures 50, 60, and 70 Â°C, respectively. The permeate side contained less than 1 ppm of PFPeA revealing that the PFPeA moved across the PTFE membrane during DCMD, which is attributed to progressive surface diffusion over time. This study opens a new route to concentrate and remove amphiphilic molecules, such as PFAS, from source points, relevant to landfill leachates or surface waters. The study also points at gaps in materials science and surface engineering to be tackled to deal with PFAS compounds efficiently."
"Sustainable and renewable bio-based natural fibres and its application for 3d printed concrete: A review Mechanical Properties; Sisal; Coir The concept of sustainability and the utilization of renewable bio-based sources have gained prominent attention in the construction industry. Material selection in construction plays a significant role in design and manufacturing process of sustainable building construction. Several studies are being carried out worldwide to investigate the potential use of natural fibres as reinforcement in concrete with its noticeable environmental benefits and mechanical properties. 3D printed concrete (3DPC) is another emerging technology, which has been under-developed for the past decade. The integration of reinforcement is one of the major challenges in the application of this new technology in real-life scenario. Presently, artificial fibres have been used as a reinforcement material for this special printable concrete mixture. However, natural fibre composites have received significant attention by many 3DPC constructions due to their lightweight energy conservation and environmentally friendly nature. These benchmarking characteristics unlock the wider area of natural fibres into the composite sector and challenge the substitution of artificial fibres. Hence, this paper presents a comprehensive review on the current practice and advantages of natural fibres in conventional concrete construction. Subsequently, with a view to the future efficient 3DPC construction, the potentials of natural fibres such as eco-friendly, higher impact, thermal, structural, and fire performance over the artificial fibres were highlighted, and their applicability in 3DPC as composites was recommended."
"Effects of distance from canal and degradation history on peat bulk density in a degraded tropical peatland Indonesia; Swamp Forest; Biomass Burning Over recent decades, the combination of deforestation, peat drainage and fires have resulted in widespread degradation of Southeast Asia's tropical peatlands. These disturbances are generally thought to increase peat soil bulk density through peat drying and shrinkage, compaction, and consolidation. Biological oxidation and fires burning across these landscapes also consume surface peat, exposing older peat strata. The prevalence and severity of deforestation, peat drainage and fire are typically greater closer to canals, built to drain peatlands and provide access routes for people. We compared bulk densities of 240 cm peat profiles from intact forests and degraded peatlands broadly, and also assessed differences between degraded peatlands near-to-canals (50â€“200 m from the nearest canal) and far-from-canals (300+ m from the nearest canal). The effects of vegetation type and fire frequency on bulk density, irrespective of the distance from canal, were also investigated. Mean bulk density values ranged between 0.08 and 0.16 g cmâˆ’3 throughout the 240 cm peat profiles. Drainage of peat near-to-canals increased bulk density of peat above the minimum water table depth. Degradation by deforestation and fire also increased bulk densities of upper peat strata, albeit with greater variability. Peat sampled further from canals experienced less intense water table drawdowns, buffering them from drainage effects. These areas were also more commonly forested and burnt less frequently. Differences in bulk densities below minimum water table levels are less clear, but may reflect lowering of the current peat surface in degraded peatlands broadly. These results clearly show that important differences in bulk density exist across degraded peatlands that are spatially dependent on distance from canals and disturbance history. These landscape features should be taken into account when designing future bulk density sampling efforts and peatland restoration programs, or when extrapolating from existing sources in order to make accurate inferences from them."
"Implications of co-contamination with aged heavy metals and total petroleum hydrocarbons on natural attenuation and ecotoxicity in Australian soils Bioremediation; Bioaugmentation; Contaminated Soil The bioremediation of historic industrial contaminated sites is a complex process. Co-contamination, often with lead which was commonly added to gasoline until 16 years ago is one of the biggest challenges affecting the clean-up of these sites. In this study, the effect of heavy metals, as co-contaminant, together with total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) is reported, in terms of remaining soil toxicity and the structure of the microbial communities. Contaminated soil samples from a relatively hot and dry climate in Western Australia were collected (n = 27). Analysis of soils showed the presence of both contaminants, TPHs and heavy metals. The Microtox test confirmed that their co-presence elevated the remaining ecotoxicity. Toxicity was correlated with the presence of lead, zinc and TPH (0.893, 0.599 and 0.488), respectively, assessed using Pearson Correlation coefficient factor. Next Generation Sequencing of soil bacterial 16S rRNA, revealed a lack of dominate genera; however, despite the variation in soil type, a few genera including Azospirillum spp. and Conexibacter were present in most soil samples (85% and 82% of all soils, respectively). Likewise, many genera of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were identified in all soil samples. Streptomyces spp. was presented in 93% of the samples with abundance between 7% and 40%. In contrast, Acinetobacter spp. was found in only one sample but was a dominant member of (45%) of the microbial community. In addition, some bacterial genera were correlated to the presence of the heavy metals, such as Geodermatophilus spp., Rhodovibrio spp. and Rubrobacter spp. which were correlated with copper, lead and zinc, respectively. This study concludes that TPH and heavy metal co-contamination significantly elevated the associated toxicity. This is an important consideration when carrying out risk assessment associated with natural attenuation. This study also improves knowledge about the dynamics of microbial communities in mixed contamination scenarios. Elevated ecotoxicity was associated with the presence of heavy metals along with TPH in soil samples. Many hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were observed with no major dominance."
"Toward sustainable environmental quality: Identifying priority research questions for Latin America PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs The Global Horizon Scanning Project (GHSP) is an innovative initiative that aims to identify important global environmental quality research needs. Here we report 20 key research questions from Latin America (LA). Members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) LA and other scientists from LA were asked to submit research questions that would represent priority needs to address in the region. One hundred questions were received, then partitioned among categories, examined, and some rearranged during a workshop in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Twenty priority research questions were subsequently identified. These research questions included developing, improving, and harmonizing across LA countries methods for 1) identifying contaminants and degradation products in complex matrices (including biota); 2) advancing prediction of contaminant risks and effects in ecosystems, addressing lab-to-field extrapolation challenges, and understanding complexities of multiple stressors (including chemicals and climate change); and 3) improving management and regulatory tools toward achieving sustainable development. Whereas environmental contaminants frequently identified in these key questions were pesticides, pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors or modulators, plastics, and nanomaterials, commonly identified environmental challenges were related to agriculture, urban effluents, solid wastes, pulp and paper mills, and natural extraction activities. Several interesting research topics included assessing and preventing pollution impacts on conservation protected areas, integrating environment and health assessments, and developing strategies for identification, substitution, and design of less hazardous chemicals (e.g., green chemistry). Finally, a recurrent research need included developing an understanding of differential sensitivity of regional species and ecosystems to environmental contaminants and other stressors. Addressing these critical questions will support development of long-term strategic research efforts to advance more sustainable environmental quality and protect public health and the environment in LA.

"Estimation of Bearing Capacity of Piles in Cohesionless Soil Using Optimised Machine Learning Approaches Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines; Cone Penetration Test; Artificial Neural Network Accurate estimation of the bearing capacity of piles requires complex modelling techniques which are not justified by timeframe, budget, or scope of the projects. In this study, six advanced machine learning algorithms including decision tree, k-nearest neighbour, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, random forest, support vector regressor and extremely gradient boosting are employed to model the bearing capacity of piles in cohesionless soil, and the particle swarm optimisation algorithm is used to optimate the hyper-parameters of machine learning algorithms. A dataset comprising of 59 cases is employed and the R-squared value, root mean square error and variance accounted for are used as performance metrics to compare the performance of optimised machine learning methods. The comparison reveals that the optimised machine learning methods have great potential to estimate bearing capacity of piles and the particle swarm optimisation algorithm is efficient in the hyper-parameter tuning. The results show that R-squared values of six optimised machine learning approaches on the testing set vary from 0.731 to 0.9615. Also, the optimised extremely gradient boosting (R-squared value = 0.9615) shows the best performance compared with other algorithms. Furthermore, the relative importance of influential variable is investigated, which shows that effective stress is the most influential variable for bearing capacity of piles with an importance score of 30.9%. In addition, the results by the optimised machine learning method are compared to the Î²-method which is a popular empirical method. It is revealed the prominent performance of optimised machine learning approaches."
"Effects of sanitation and hygiene perceptions on international travelers' health, travel plans and trip experiences in India Anti-Bacterial Agents; Rifaximin; Enterotoxigenic Escherichia Coli Background: International travelers often experience travelers' diarrhea. However, there is paucity of data on whether self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms influence travelers' perceptions of adequacy of sanitation and hygiene services encountered during travel, and to what degree their travel plans, and overall trip experience are impacted. Methods: A cross-sectional face-to-face survey was conducted amongst international travelers in India. Data collected included socio-demographics, travel characteristics, self-reported occurrence and frequency/severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, perceptions of sanitation and hygiene encountered, and adverse effects of symptoms on travel plans and trip experiences. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were performed to describe differences and associations between categorical variables. Results: Of the 300 international travelers surveyed, 46.3% experienced diarrhea. At least two thirds of travelers perceived the quality of sanitation (67.0%) and hygiene (70.0%) encountered to be inadequate. Perceptions of inadequate sanitation (adjusted OR = 3.0; 95% CI 1.7â€“5.5) and poor hygiene (adjusted OR = 7.7; 95% CI 4.1â€“15.5) were higher among travelers who experienced diarrhea. Additionally, both higher likelihood of travel plans being affected (adjusted OR = 10.7; 95% CI 5.1â€“23.6) and adverse impacts on overall trip experience (adjusted OR = 2.8; 95% CI 1.4â€“5.8) were reported among those who experienced diarrhea. Conclusions: More than two thirds of travelers surveyed in India experienced inadequate sanitation and hygiene services, with perceptions influenced by occurrence and frequency of diarrhea. Self-reported diarrhea was also associated with adverse effects on travel plans and overall trip experience. While these results may seem intuitive, they have important implications and suggest that improving sanitation and hygiene standards in India could potentially enhance tourism."

"Acupuncture for recurrent urinary tract infection in women: a systematic review and meta-analysis Fosfomycin; Urinary Tract Infections; Anti-Bacterial Agents Background: Increasing antibiotic resistance has motivated interest in non-antibiotic prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI). Objectives: To conduct a systematic review of the current state of evidence of acupuncture for uncomplicated rUTI in women. Search strategy: Nine databases (PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, AMED, CBM, CNKI, CQVIP, Wanfang) were searched from inception to February 2019. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of acupuncture and related therapies for prophylaxis or treatment of uncomplicated rUTI in women were included. Data collection and analysis: Risk of bias was assessed, and the quality and strength of evidence evaluated using the GRADE framework. Results were reported as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results: Five RCTs involving 341 participants were included. Methodological quality of studies and strength of the evidence were low to moderate. The chance of achieving a composite cure with acupuncture therapies was greater than that with antibiotics (three studies, 170 participants, RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.31-2.81, I2 = 38%). The risk of UTI recurrence was lower with acupuncture than with no treatment (two studies, 135 participants, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26â€“0.58, I2 = 0%) and sham acupuncture (one study, 53 participants, RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22â€“0.92). Conclusions: Acupuncture appeared to be beneficial for treatment and prophylaxis of rUTIs, noting the limitations of the current evidence. Given the growing challenge of antibiotic resistance, there is a need for high-quality RCTs of non-pharmacological interventions such as acupuncture. Tweetable abstract: This review found that acupuncture may improve treatment and prevent recurrence of urinary tract infection in women."
"Digital citizenship in a global society: a feminist approach Children's Rights; Childhood; Children with Disabilities In an era of datafication, social networking, and globalization, â€œdigital citizenshipâ€ has become an increasingly relevant and popular concept employed by diverse societal actors to promote digital capacity, literacy, and participation. To date, however, limited scholarly attention has been paid to the role of gender power relations in digital citizenship discourses, theories, or practices. In this paper, we conceptualize digital citizenship as a status (what it means to be a citizen), a practice (what it means to act as a citizen), and an intersubjective experience (what it means to occupy the outside, inside, or liminal space of citizenship). We argue that an intersectional, multi-layered, feminist approach to digital citizenship offers a valuable way to first analyze gender subordination and exclusionary practices in digital societies, and second to guide action that promotes a feminist democratic project of transformation and empowerment."

"Changing the Climate on Corporate Emissions Despite climate change being well established in science (IPCC, 2014) and broader society (Hawkins et al., 2017), the process of developing corporate reporting guidelines has been relatively recent (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, 2017, ASIC, 2018) and primarily voluntary (Sullivan and Gouldson, 2017). In the context of rising corporate contribution to climate change (Pearse and Bohm, 2014 ), and the severity of its impacts (World Bank, 2018, IPCC, 2014), this provides an ideal opportunity for studies which address the development, measurement and reporting of climate change related KPls. The objectives of this research include a shift in focus in the ways organisations recognise, measure and report on key climate change indicators; shifting to more effective KPls with the capacity to meaningfully reduce Australia's carbon emissions."
"Ammonia Synthesis by Alkaline Membrane Based Electrolysis: CSIRO PhD Scholarship (PhD Candidate: Song Huang) Ammonia is produced via the Haber-Bosch process that requires high energy input (~500°C and 150-300 bar) and results in carbon emission (releases about half of the UK CO2 every year) and consumes about 2% of the global fossil fuel energy. Based on the energy content of ammonia (5.2 MWh per tonne), more than 50% of the energy is lost in the synthesis process alone.  Therefore, there is enormous potential for reducing energy losses in synthesis process by developing alternative synthesis route, and that also uses renewable energy, so the process is emission-less. This project aims to directly synthesize ammonia using an alkaline membrane
based electrolysis."
"Water footprint: applying the water footprint assessment method to Australian agriculture Water Footprint; Water-Energy Nexus; Nexus BACKGROUND: Water footprint assessment is essential for the evaluation of water scarcity that considers both direct and indirect water consumption along the supply chain. This paper presents the estimation of water footprint for locally grown fruits and vegetables in Australia. Water footprint was calculated based on the framework developed in the Water Footprint Assessment Manual for the crops which are the most practicable to grow in Australia. Nine different crops (apples, grapes, tomatoes, oranges, peaches/nectarines, cherries, potatoes, carrots/turnips and almonds) in the agricultural industry were selected and identified as the most water-consumptive crop and least water-consumptive crop. For each type of crop, the three main water footprint components (blue, green, and grey water) were calculated. RESULTS: It was found that almond had the highest water footprint (6671.96 m3 tonâˆ’1) and tomato had the lowest water footprint (212.24 m3 tonâˆ’1) in Australia. From the global comparison, it is revealed that total water footprint for Australian crops is much higher than the corresponding international average values, except for tomatoes, potatoes and almonds. Also, almonds had the highest water footprint among the nine crops investigated. CONCLUSION: The study provides an insight into future sustainable cropping patterns in Australia, which suggest that tomatoes, carrots/turnips, potatoes and apples should continue to be grown in Australia, whereas stone fruit (e.g., almonds) should no longer be grown because of its high water footprint.

"Electrification of residential heating, cooling and hot water: Load smoothing using onsite photovoltaics, heat pump and thermal batteries Demand Response; Demand Side Management; Energy Conservation Due to the pressing timeframe to meet emissions reduction targets, electrification of heat is the fastest approach for decarbonising buildings. However, the high power demand of electric heating and cooling devices poses a significant challenge to the electricity supply chain when they are deployed on mass. Adding rooftop solar photovoltaic systems does not necessarily eliminate this problem. Cheap and safe thermal storage offers a potentially viable solution allowing electric HVAC & hot water systems to be deployed with minimal impact on the grid. We propose such a multi-function thermal system combining solar photovoltaics, heat pump, and thermal storage for supplying residential heating, cooling and hot water demand. We investigate the effectiveness of this system in terms of electricity demand management and solar utilisation in different geographical locations. The results illustrate that with effective control, such a system can reduce a building's annual grid-electricity demand by about 50% to 80%, and increase its solar self-consumption to around 60%. The temporal load profile is also significantly reduced and flattened, allowing high level of distributed PV penetration without negative impacts on the grid. We show that these benefits can be earned at a reasonable cost to consumers helping them to reap a positive rate of return compared to alternative options for different climatic and regional conditions. The proposed thermal storage system is demonstrated as a cost-effective and safe distributed energy solution to ease the stress exerted on the grid from excess PV power as well as heating and cooling related peak demand."
"Impact of microalgae species and solution salinity on algal treatment of wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Six common microalgal species, including freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus abundans, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Coelastrum microporum, and marine microalgae Nannochloropsis salina and Dunaliella tertiolecta, were tested in batch treatment to identify the most promising species for remediating a municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC). Selected species were then studied at different ROC salinity levels (5, 10, and 15 g TDS/L) in semi-continuous treatment to evaluate their potential for nutrient remediation, and biogas production through anaerobic digestion. S. abundans, C. vulgaris, and N. salina showed higher potential for growth and nutrient remediation under salinity stress. Further tests revealed that N. salina adapted well to ROC conditions, and S. abundans could grow better and had higher tolerance to the elevated salinity than C. vulgaris. S. abundans and N. salina performed better for removing nutrients and organic matter (11.5â€“18 mg/L/d TN, 7.1â€“8.2 mg/L/d TP, and 8.6â€“12.4 mg/L/d DOC). Increasing salinity led to growth inhibition and N uptake reduction for freshwater species but had no significant effect on TP removal. Biochemical methane potential tests showed the algal biomass produced a significant amount of methane (e.g., up to 422 mL CH4/g VS for N. salina), suggesting the algae generated from the ROC treatment could produce significant amounts of energy through anaerobic digestion without the need for pretreatment. This study showed the environmental and economic potential of the algal system for future applications."
"Evapotranspiration and biogeochemical regulation in a mountain peatland: insights from eddy covariance and ionic balance measurements Eddy Covariance; Net Ecosystem Exchange; Ecosystem Study Region: The mountainous catchments in the Australian Alps are one of the highest water-yielding regions within a generally dry continent. Peatlands are critical water-regulating components of these catchments, and their response to a changing climate will impact all downstream environments and water availability for human uses. Study Focus: Mountain peatland ecohydrology, and in particular the role of evapotranspiration, remains incompletely understood. This study focused on evapotranspiration and biogeochemical regulation of â€œAlpine Sphagnum Bogsâ€, with a case study at Watchbed Creek peatland. Eddy covariance was used to quantify evapotranspiration and combined with Penman-Monteith-based evapotranspiration to calculate an â€˜ecosystem vegetation coefficientâ€™ (KESV). Base-flow evapotranspiration and analyses of Clâˆ’, Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in peatland stream water were used to assess biogeochemical processes. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: This work demonstrates that evapotranspiration is a major component of the water budget, 26% of annual precipitation. Further, we show how KESV calculated from direct measurements at one site may enable evapotranspiration to be modelled for other mountain catchments. The seasonally dependent nature of the biogeochemical regulation processes observed in this mountain peatland can be used as a reference to evaluate the condition of peatlands under similar synoptic weather conditions. In practice, this means that mountain ecosystem restoration can now be informed by a better understanding of the ecohydrology of these critical high mountain catchments."

"Rethinking community hubs: community facilities as critical infrastructure Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience This article discusses community hubs (CH) â€” multi-purpose institutions that host social, educational and health services, while building social connectedness and community capacity. Major events such as climate change, wildfires and the COVID-19 pandemic are placing new demands on CHs to be emergency refuges, information centres, community kitchens and more. Such events highlight the critical nature of social infrastructure to both disaster responses and long-term community building and resilience. Such events, though, expose new seams of infrastructural and spatial injustice and place strain on insecure institutional arrangements. Infrastructure policy has typically focussed on large-scale systems and networks in defining and resourcing critical infrastructure. We examine some conceptual and policy challenges in rethinking CHs as anchor institutions for addressing vulnerability, building community resilience, and fostering adaptive responses to enable more socially and environmentally just development."
"Engaging with uncertainty and ambiguity through participatory 'Adaptive Pathways' approaches: Scoping the literature Robust Decision Making; Climate Change Adaptation; Uncertainty Analysis Climate change adaptation planning demands decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. Adaptive Pathways (AP) planning is receiving increased attention as a method to guide adaptation planning in the face of uncertainties. The approach has been most extensively developed and applied in large, well-funded contexts such as the Thames Barrier and Dutch Delta program. However, the development of AP planning has focused much less on the parallel need for engaging with the challenge of ambiguity - that there are diverse, sometimes contending, knowledges, values, and stakes involved. A more nascent body of work has been exploring ways of engaging with both the uncertainties and ambiguities of adaptation through various participatory approaches to AP planning. This paper sought to synthesise insights from this emerging work. Examining the peer-reviewed and grey literature identified eight cases from four countries across five different policy issues that provided details of how they approached diverse participation. Analysis of this small suite of cases provided some key insights for those seeking to use participatory approaches to AP planning to engage with the inherent uncertainties and (arguably necessary) ambiguities of adaptation. The paper concludes with a call for greater publication of details regarding how participatory approaches to methods such as AP planning have been undertaken not just what was undertaken."

"Key preferences of tourists during COVID-19 pandemic in luxury hotels: Evidence from qualitative data Social Media; Online Reviews; Brand Community There is a decline in revenue and occupancy rates in the hotels during the pandemic. For the sustainable and long-term recovery of the hotel industry, the guests need to be analyzed for their stay preferences. This study attempts to find the preferred attributes of the travelers visiting the Indian luxury hotels during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research investigated the post-visit experiences from the online reviews published by tourists on TripAdvisor.com. Thematic salience valence analysis and lexical salience valence analysis was used to identify the vital attributes of the hotel industry. The study revealed staff, location, food, hygiene, and rooms as the preferred hotel attributes, in which the coastal locations were highly considered for location based marketing of luxury hotels, and non-compliance of COVID-19 standards and complaints for upgradations in the rooms were the non-recommenders for the luxury hotels. The dashboard-based salience valence zone analysis was used to provide suggestions to the hotel authorities by revealing the significant and critical hotel attributes simultaneously for prompt handling of the issues during the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Blockchain on stool land acquisition: Lessons from Ghana for strengthening land tenure security other than titling Ghana; Urban Planning; Resource Curse The paper develops a blockchain-enabled framework for stool land acquisition in Ghana that makes it possible for parties with interest in lands to object to their sale if the transaction is being conducted on their blind side. The framework also makes it possible for potential land buyers to authenticate in real-time the ownership status of the land they want to acquireâ€“whether the property is registered with the Lands Commission or has been deregistered from the Commission's records. The framework is a response to Ghana's current opaque and weakly coordinated land administration systems flourishing the phenomenon of multiple sale of same lands and other land tenure security problems in the country. Further to providing a blockchain-enabled stool lands acquisition framework that enhances transparency, accountability, and better land records keeping in Ghana, the paper takes issues with the view widely held in international development, government, judicial, and some academic circles that titling or lease registration is the only or primary viable means of securing land rights. Our findings from Ghana show that in addition to creating predatory economies for powerful land sector actors (e.g., chiefs and land administrators) to extort outrageous sums of money from land buyers, the heavy emphasis on land titling or lease registration undermines efforts at strengthening other less cumbersome, less costly and less corruption-laden aspects of land administration to improve property rights in the land sector."
"Is the tracking error time-varying? Evidence from agricultural ETCs Investor Sentiment; Exchange Traded Funds; Stock Market This study extensively analyses a recently popularized asset class, exchange-traded commodities (ETCs). We demonstrate that the tracking error of ETCs is dependent on the volatility of the underlying commodity prices but not persistent. Furthermore, we find the tracking ability of agricultural ETCs is affected by the replication method and the leverage of the ETCs. Our findings are important for academics and market regulators as they indicate the structure of an ETC and the time-varying volatility of agricultural prices matters for its tracking performance."

"The role of neighbourhoods accessibility in residential mobility Built Environment; Mode Choice; Urban Form Household decisions to move from or stay at a current location may be based on a great number of variables. There has been substantial discussion among planners about the effect of the built environment in the choice of residential location. However, there is limited research on the role of non-motorised accessibility on residential location. Households may base their decision to move from or stay at a current location on the neighbourhood's accessibility. The public transport accessibility, walkability and bikeability of a neighbourhood may affect residentsâ€™ decisions to stay or move from their current location. The focus of this paper is on modelling and comparing the influence of non-motorised accessibility measures on the number of years that households stay at their current location. The paper addresses this issue by employing three non-motorised accessibility measures in separate ordered logistic regression (OLR) models. Focusing on metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, the Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA, 2012) was adopted to model years of residency incorporating socio-economic characteristics, built environment features and accessibility measures. Key findings indicate that non-motorised accessibility has statistically-significant impacts on the number of years that residents live at their current address. Furthermore, of the accessibility measures, access to public transport has the greatest impact."
"Intercultural and Interdisciplinary Engagement for Embedding Sustainability Internship and Residency; Internship Program; Employability Sustainability teaching and learning is about understanding and making decisions that support outcomes to achieve the triple bottom line: environmental, economic and social. To ensure sustainability outcomes, scholars have called for curricular innovation to support interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary learning to embed sustainability learning for students. This entry presents a cross-cultural immersive experience for teaching and learning sustainability outcomes from environmental, economic and social dimensions for Australian and Indonesian students. The combined classroom with students from Australia and Indonesia was set up. Prior discussions with teaching staff from the two universities and engagement with the villagers in Indonesia set up the scope of the teaching and learning experiences for both cohorts of students. Australian students funded through the New Colombo Plan from various disciplinary programs interacted with architecture and design students from an Indonesian university in Indonesia over a two-week period. The students worked collaboratively to undertake a needs analysis and develop designs for a multifunction educational facility for a village in the island of Java, Indonesia. The village community was involved in the participatory process for informing and developing the concept designs, which were then presented to the village community for selection and construction. The students and teachers were strangers to each other before the collaborative classroom experience. Yet, the bonds formed between teachers and students of both cultures went beyond the classroom. The cohorts of Australian students and the Indonesian students continued to engage with each other not just immediately after their experience of working together in the Indonesian classroom, but also beyond their university life. Such experiences during university life not only create a deeper understanding of sustainability from multiple dimensions, but also life-long friendships between students, shaping their post university work and life experiences. Recommendations are provided to support such experiences."

"Advancing real estate decision making: understanding known, unknown and unknowable risks Decision Making; Imprecise Probabilities; Major Accident Purpose: Whilst existing literature on real estate risk management focusses almost exclusively on holistic risk management techniques, documented increases in frequency and magnitude of unforeseen, rare and extreme events can throw up sudden, unexpected shocks that can challenge recognised real estate decision-making strategies. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: To advance real estate decision-making practice in this area, this research paper takes the skilfully conceptualised downside risk framework presented by Diebold et al. (2010), being the known (K), the unknown (u) and the unknowable (U) risk categories, to provide a blueprint for effective real estate decision making in a changing global environment. Findings: In recording categories of risk, managing uncertainty can be achieved by an interrelated approach of adaption, robustness and resilience. This is important part of a real estate managerâ€™s decision-making toolkit as risk recognition and knowledge of KuU event categories can augment an effective management strategy. Originality/value: The mastery of modern real estate risk management can be better served by understanding and managing extreme downside risk events. Creating a comprehensive risk management framework can enhance comparative real estate performance whereby unprepared competitors fail in a world increasingly affected by large, highly improbable and unpredictable events."

"High frequency acoustic nebulization for pulmonary delivery of antibiotic alternatives against Staphylococcus aureus Phage Therapy; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Caudovirales The increasing prevalence of multidrug resistant bacteria has warranted the search for new antimicrobial agents as existing antibiotics lose their potency. Among these, bacteriophage therapy, as well as the administration of specific bacteriolysis agents, i.e., lytic enzymes, have emerged as attractive alternatives. Nebulizers offer the possibility for delivering these therapeutics directly to the lung, which is particularly advantageous as a non-invasive and direct route to treat bacterial lung infections. Nevertheless, nebulizers can often result in significant degradation of the bacteriophage or protein, both structurally and functionally, due to the large stresses the aerosolization process imposes on these entities. In this work, we assess the capability of a novel low-cost and portable hybrid surface and bulk acoustic wave platform (HYDRA) to nebulize a Myoviridae bacteriophage (phage K) and lytic enzyme (lysostaphin) that specifically targets Staphylococcus aureus. Besides its efficiency in producing phage or protein-laden aerosols within the 1â€“5 Î¼m respirable range for optimum delivery to the lower respiratory tract where lung infections commonly take place, we observe that the HYDRA platformâ€”owing to the efficiency of driving the aerosolization process at relatively low powers and high frequencies (approximately 10 MHz)â€”does not result in appreciable denaturation of the phages or proteins, such that the loss of antimicrobial activity following nebulization is minimized. Specifically, a low (0.1 log10 (pfu/ml)) titer loss was obtained with the phages, resulting in a high viable respirable fraction of approximately 90%. Similarly, minimal loss of antimicrobial activity was obtained with lysostaphin upon nebulization wherein its minimum inhibitory concentration (0.5 Î¼g/ml) remained unaltered as compared with the non-nebulized control. These results therefore demonstrate the potential of the HYDRA nebulization platform as a promising strategy for pulmonary administration of alternative antimicrobial agents to antibiotics for the treatment of lung diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria."

"A novel discovery protocol for IoT based home automation Fog Computing; Network Protocol; Internet of Things It is proposed that Home Automation systems would be vastly improved by the novel approach of eliminating the Permanent Central Controller as it is the source of significant problems. This leaves the responsibilities of the Permanent Central Controller to be assumed by the remaining devices in the system, including IoT devices and interface devices such as smartphones and computers. While the capacity for joining devices to a network without the Permanent Central Controller has been considered, device discovery has not. This paper examines existing protocols but finds that while many have worthwhile aspects none are suitable for the task. A novel discovery protocol is proposed, using smartphones or computers as intermittent control devices. This new protocol is developed with the aid of a new Robust Network Development Methodology which is able to anticipate problematic use cases prior to implementation. This methodology was very successful in identifying and eliminating significant problems with the new protocol. Implementation and measurement of the novel discovery protocol demonstrates the viability and robustness of discovery without a Permanent Central Controller on low cost ESP8266 family devices."
"Hyper-heuristic online learning for self-assembling swarm robots Timetabling Problem; Hyper-heuristics; Genetic Algorithm A robot swarm is a solution for difficult and large scale tasks. However, controlling and coordinating a swarm of robots is challenging, because of the complexity and uncertainty of the environment where manual programming of robot behaviours is often impractical. In this study we propose a hyper-heuristic methodology for swarm robots. It allows robots to create suitable actions based on a set of low-level heuristics, where each heuristic is a behavioural element. With online learning, the robot behaviours can be improved during execution by autonomous heuristic adjustment. The proposed hyper-heuristic framework is applied to surface cleaning tasks on buildings where multiple separate surfaces exist and complete surface information is difficult to obtain. Under this scenario, the robot swarm not only needs to clean the surfaces efficiently by distributing the robots, but also to move across surfaces by self-assembling into a bridge structure. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the hyper-heuristic framework; the same group of robots was able to autonomously deal with multiple surfaces of different layouts. Their behaviours can improve over time because of the online learning mechanism."

"Prevalence and intensity of cardicola spp. Infection in ranched southern bluefin tuna and a comparison of diagnostic methods Opecoelidae; Digenea (Trematoda); Animals The parasitic blood flukes Cardicola forsteri and C. orientalis are an ongoing health concern for Southern Bluefin Tuna Thunnus maccoyii (SBT) ranched in Australia. In this study we compared the effect of treatment, company, and ranching year on blood fluke infections in ranched SBT. SBT were sampled during the 2018 and 2019 ranching seasons from praziquantel (PZQ) treated pontoons and untreated pontoons managed by two companies. Severity of infection was diagnosed by several criteria including adult fluke counts from hearts, egg counts from gill filaments and the use of specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for detection of C. forsteri and C. orientalis ITS-2 DNA in SBT hearts and gills. PZQ treatment remains highly effective against C. forsteri infection. Prevalence and intensity of Cardicola spp. infection was lower in 2019 than 2018 for Company A in treated pontoons at week 12 and week 17 of ranching, and lower for Company A than Company B in untreated pontoons at month 5 of ranching. Results indicate re-infection may be less likely in the environment near Company A pontoons, and consistent years of treatment may have lowered the parasite load in the environment. qPCR demonstrated higher sensitivity when comparing diagnostic methods for C. forsteri in heart, and higher specificity when comparing diagnostic methods for Cardicola spp. in gills. Continuing to monitor blood fluke infections in ranched SBT can help to detect changes in drug efficacy over time and help industry to develop a best practice for treatment."
"(Phase 1) Enhancing Our Dandenong Creek:  Pollution Prevention Ten sites have been established in the Upper Dandenong Creek Catchment to understand the spatial distribution of pollutants and to establish the baseline condition of the area. Sediment from these sites will be sampled in 2018 (usually in spring) and this will be the seventh collection of sediment at these sites, including the initial survey in 2010. The activity within the Pollution Detection program helps us to understand the temporal changes in condition and assess whether pollution mitigation measures implemented over the project are reducing the pollution load to Dandenong Creek.  Additionally it enables us to see if there are any emerging chemicals that need to be monitored in future. Furthermore, results from this survey inform us about priority chemicals within the Creek and from this we can identify sub-catchments for further investigation into pollution sourcing and subsequently pollution prevention.

"ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies  FLEET (administered by Monash University) Decreasing energy use is a grand challenge facing society. The ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low Energy Electronics Technologies addresses this challenge by realizing fundamentally new types of electronic conduction without resistance in solid-state systems at room temperature. Transport without resistance will be realized in topological insulators that conduct only along their edges, and in semiconductors that support superflow of electrons strongly coupled to photons. These pathways are enabled by the new science of atomically thin materials. Novel resistance-free electronic phenomena at room temperature will form the basis of integrated electronics technology with ultra-low energy consumption."
"“It just fits my needs better”: Autistic students and parents’ experiences of learning from home during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic Autism; Children with Developmental Disabilities; Caregivers Background and aims: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to people's lives, especially for families, whose children have been taken out of schools during lockdown restrictions and required to learn from home. Little is known, however, about the perceived impact of the lockdown restrictions on the educational experiences of autistic children and young people â€“ a group whose conventional schooling experiences are already often challenging. In this study, we sought to (1) understand these experiences from the perspectives of autistic young people and their parents, and (2) identify the underlying sources of positive experiences at this challenging time, in order to inform the ways in which autistic children might flourish at school in more normal times. Methods: Ninety-one Australian participants, including 16 autistic young people aged 12â€“18 years, 32 autistic parents and 43 non-autistic parents of autistic young people aged 3â€“18 years, took part in semi-structured interviews about their experiences of life during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The interviews were subjected to reflexive, thematic analysis to identify themes and subthemes for each research question. Results: Overall, our participants initially found the transition to learning from home extremely challenging, with parents reporting that the support received from schools was far from adequate. After that initial period of transition, however, many autistic children reported flourishing at home both educationally and personally. For these children and families, we identified three key ingredients essential to this flourishing, including: (i) the importance of connected, trusting relationships (â€˜peopleâ€™); (ii) the sensory and social safety of home (â€˜placeâ€™); and (iii) the flexibility to pace and structure learning to suit the individual child (â€˜timeâ€™). Conclusions: While the initial COVID-19 lockdown presented many challenges to children learning at home, there were aspects of this otherwise-unsettling situation that enabled children to thrive and from which we can learn for the future. Implications: These findings have important implications for understanding how and when autistic children might thrive in institutional educational settings once the pandemic subsides, focusing on the relationships between teachers and students, the nature of the physical learning environment and the need for greater flexibility in planning the school day."
"Evaluating supply chain collaboration barriers in smalland medium-sized enterprises Disruption; Supply Chain Disruptions; Dual Sourcing The disruption has a significant impact on supply chain collaboration (SCC) which is an important task to improve performance for many enterprises. This is especially critical for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We developed a decision-modeling framework for analyzing SCC barriers in SMEs for the emerging economy in Bangladesh. Through literature review and expert opinion survey, we have identified a comprehensive list of SCC barriers under four main categories, namely, information-related, communication-related, intra-organizational, and inter-organizational barriers. Then we applied the Grey DEMATEL and Fuzzy Best-Worst methods to evaluate these SCC barriers and compared the results. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the proposed approach. The study reveals that lack of communication is the most crucial barrier in SCC, providing a model for assessing barriers in other emerging economies. This study contributes to the literature by analyzing SCC barriers and by comparing the results obtained from two different MCDM methods. The findings of this study can help decision-makers to plan for overcoming the most prioritized SCC barriers which ultimately contribute to improving the resilience and sustainability performances of SMEs.

"Happy feet in a hostile world? The future of penguins depends on proactive management of current and expected threats Penguin; Eudyptes; Aptenodytes Forsteri Penguins face a wide range of threats. Most observed population changes have been negative and have happened over the last 60 years. Today, populations of 11 penguin species are decreasing. Here we present a review that synthesizes details of threats faced by the world's 18 species of penguins. We discuss alterations to their environment at both breeding sites on land and at sea where they forage. The major drivers of change appear to be climate, and food web alterations by marine fisheries. In addition, we also consider other critical and/or emerging threats, namely human disturbance near nesting sites, pollution due to oil, plastics and chemicals such as mercury and persistent organic compounds. Finally, we assess the importance of emerging pathogens and diseases on the health of penguins. We suggest that in the context of climate change, habitat degradation, introduced exotic species and resource competition with fisheries, successful conservation outcomes will require new and unprecedented levels of science and advocacy. Successful conservation stories of penguin species across their geographical range have occurred where there has been concerted effort across local, national and international boundaries to implement effective conservation planning."
"Multispecies justice: Climate-just futures with, for and beyond humans Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work In 2019, the climate emergency entered mainstream debates. The normative frame of climate justice as conceived in academia, policy arenas, and grassroots action, although imperative and growing in popularity across climate movements, is no longer adequate to address this emergency. This is for two reasons: first, as a framing for the problem, current notions of climate justice are insufficient to overcome the persistent silencing of voices belonging to multiple â€œothersâ€; and second, they do not question, and thus implicitly condone, human exceptionalism and the violence it enacts, historically and in this era of the Anthropocene. Therefore, we advocate for the concept of multispecies justice to enrich climate justice in order to more effectively confront the climate crisis. The advantage of reconceptualizing climate justice in this way is that it becomes more inclusive; it acknowledges the differential histories and practices of social, environmental, and ecological harm, while opening just pathways into uncertain futures. A multispecies justice lens expands climate justice by decentering the human and by recognizing the everyday interactions that bind individuals and societies to networks of close and distant others, including other people and more-than-human beings. Such a relational lens provides a vital scientific, practical, material, and ethical road map for navigating the complex responsibilities and politics in the climate crisis. Most importantly, it delineates what genuine flourishing could mean, what systemic transformations may involve (and with whom), how to live with inevitable and possibly intolerable losses, and how to prefigure and enact alternative and just futures. This article is categorized under: Climate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Global Justice."
"Meat Consumption and Green Gas Emissions: a Chemometrics Analysis Meat Consumption; Diet; Livestock Products The aim of this study was to relate greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) from both livestock production (enteric) and agriculture emissions with the consumption of meat from meat producer and importer countries. Data for meat consumption and emission levels of agriculture and livestock production were sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) database statistics (1961 to 2013). This data is freely available to the public and research community from the FAO webpage. Statistical data was analysed using principal component analysis (PCA), and regression models between GHGE and meat consumption were developed using partial least squares regression (PLS) and validated using cross-validation. Results of this study confirmed observations and anecdotal evidence that enteric and green gas emissions contribute to the perception of meat consumption. Although the results presented in this study are based on the data collected by an international organisation, the authors believe that results from this study can be utilised and incorporated to climate change modelling systems, in order to better understand and define the effect of GHGE on the environmental and economical sustainabilities of the meat production."
"Targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling by microRNAs as a therapeutic approach in chemoresistant osteosarcoma Osteosarcoma; MicroRNAs; Microrna Osteosarcoma (OS) is an adolescent and young adult malignancy that mostly occurs in long bones. The treatment of OS is still a big challenge for clinicians due to increasing chemoresistance, and many efforts are being made today to find more beneficial treatments. In this regard, the use of microRNAs has shown a high capacity to develop promising therapies. By targeting cancer-involved signaling pathways, microRNAs reduce the cellular level of these protein pathways; thereby reducing the growth and invasion of tumors, and even leading cancer cells to apoptosis. One of these oncogenic pathways that play an important role in OS development and can be targeted by microRNAs is the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Hence, the first goal of this review article is to explain the cross-talk of microRNAs and the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in OS and then discussing recent findings of the use of microRNAs as a therapeutic approach in OS."
"Effects of volumetric fraction and included angle of composite particles on the discharge of binary mixtures in hoppers Settling Velocity; Liquid; Power-Law Fluid The discharge behavior of particles is important in many industrial applications, such as in the core of a pebble bed reactor, which uses a hopper bed filled with many large particles. In this work, a mixture composed of two particle types, freely discharged from a pebble bed, is simulated using the discrete-element method. One is a spherical pebble of diameter equal to that of the fuel pebble of the reactor. The other is a composite particle comprising three spherical pebbles bonded together. The included angle Î± of the three pebbles characterized the particle conformation, which may affect the discharge behavior of the mixture. The effects of volume fraction of the multi-sphere Ï‡ (equivalent to the number fraction) on the discharge are also analyzed. Flow patterns, number flow rate, discharge velocity, and mean force of the mixture are computed to help in revealing discharge features. The results show that increasing either Î± or Ï‡ reduces the discharge flow rate. Fittings and correlations give a quantitative evaluation of the independent effects of Î± and Ï‡. The analysis of velocity and force explains the mechanism relevant to the main influencing factors Î± and Ï‡. The results are helpful in gaining a better understanding of the discharge feature of binary mixtures and in providing a quantitative evaluation of the discharge behavior of the reactor core, especially adverse failure conditions."

"China's E-Commerce: Empowering Rural Women? Cadres; China; Central Committee This article employs a feminist political economy perspective to explore the connection between e-commerce, entrepreneurship and gender in rural China. It discusses gendered engagement with, and discourses of, the new digital economy represented by Taobao villages, and asks: how has the success of rural e-commerce impacted the evolving gender mandate and hierarchy in a competitive market economy in rural China? Has rural women's participation in digital economic activities changed their gendered roles and the patriarchal structure in their family and village? This article argues that women's socioeconomic enablement does not necessarily translate into cultural and political empowerment. The enabling potential of female entrepreneurship is tempered by traditional constraints on women and digital capitalist exploitation of their cheap, flexible and docile labour."
"Remediation of groundwater contaminated with dye using carbon dots technology: Ecotoxicological and microbial community responses Iron Nanoparticle; Dechlorination; Wastewater Treatment Groundwater pollution poses a serious threat to the main source of clean water globally. Nanoparticles have the potential for remediation of polluted aquifers; however, environmental safety concerns associated with in situ deployments of such technology include potential detrimental effects on microorganisms in terms of toxicity and functional disruptions. In this work, we evaluated a new and ecofriendly approach using carbon dots (CDs) as Fenton-like catalysts to catalyse the degradation of dye-containing groundwater samples. This investigation aimed at evaluating the efficacy of a novel remediation technology in terms of dye degradation and toxicity reduction while assessing its impacts on aquatic microorganisms. Uncontaminated Australian groundwater samples were spiked with methylene blue and incubated in the dark, at 18 Â°C, under slow agitation, using CDs at 0.5 mg mLâˆ’1 and H2O2 at 73.5 mM for 25 h. The dye degradation rate was determined as well as the toxicity of the treated solutions using the MicrotoxÂ® bioassay. Further, to determine the changes in the groundwater microbial community, 16 S rRNA sequencing was used and evenness and diversity indices were analysed using Pielou's evenness and Simpson index, respectively. This study revealed that dye-containing groundwater were effectively treated by CDs showing a degradation rate of 78â€“82% and a significant 4-fold reduction in the toxicity. Characterisation of the groundwater microbiota revealed a predominance of at least 60% Proteobacteria phylum in all samples where diversity and evenness were maintained throughout the remediation process. The results showed that CDs could be an efficient approach to treat polluted groundwater and potentially have minimum impact on the environmental microbiome."
"Why join a sustainable neighbourhood group? An examination of the motives of group members in Lake Macquarie The aim of this exploratory research project is to investigate the motives and demographic characteristics of people who are members of sustainable neighbourhood groups (SNG’s) in Lake Macquarie. Motives are understood in this study as being “the implicit or explicit
manifestation of an individual and or/collectives drive or wish to do (or not do) something in a particular context” (Perez-Arrendondo, 2019, p. 239). Specifically, the study will explore the similarities and differences between the representations of these motives, and how the study participants position themselves and others both as individuals and as members of a sustainable neighbourhood group, to examine if there are common or shared characteristics and motivations of people who join or form a SNG."
"Selective electron beam manufactured Ti-6Al-4V lattice structures for orthopedic implant applications: Current status and outstanding challenges Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V lattices display unique mechanical and biological properties by virtue of their engineered structure. These attributes enable the innovative design of patient-specific medical implants that (i) are conformal to the intended surgical geometry, (ii) mimic the mechanical properties of natural bone, and (iii) provide superior biological interaction to traditional implants. Selective electron beam melting (SEBM) is an established metal additive manufacturing (AM) process that has enabled the design and fabrication of a variety of novel intricate lattices for implant applications over the last 15 years. This article reviews the technical and clinical characteristics of SEBM Ti-6Al-4V lattices, including (i) the SEBM process and its capabilities, (ii) the structures of human bones with an exhaustive list of corresponding mechanical properties from literature, (iii) the mechanical properties of SEBM Ti-6Al-4V lattices of various designs and their shortcomings when compared to human bones, (iv) microstructural control of SEBM Ti-6Al-4V lattices for improved performance, (v) the lattice manufacturability and associated geometric errors, and (vi) clinical cases. Existing literature on the mechanical response of SEBM Ti-6Al-4V lattice structures is exhaustively evaluated for documentation quality using established theoretical models. This extensive data-set allows novel insights into the effect of lattice design on mechanical response that is not possible with the individual data; and provides a comprehensive database for those who are actively involved in patient-specific SEBM implant design. On this basis, outstanding challenges and research opportunities for SEBM Ti-6Al-4V lattices in the biomedical domain are identified and discussed."

"Nano-plastics and their analytical characterisation and fate in the marine environment: From source to sea Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Polymer contamination is a major pollutant in all waterways and a significant concern of the 21st Century, gaining extensive research, media, and public attention. The polymer pollution problem is so vast; plastics are now observed in some of the Earth's most remote regions such as the Mariana trench. These polymers enter the waterways, migrate, breakdown; albeit slowly, and then interact with the environment and the surrounding biodiversity. It is these biodiversity and ecosystem interactions that are causing the most nervousness, where health researchers have demonstrated that plastics have entered the human food chain, also showing that plastics are damaging organisms, animals, and plants. Many researchers have focused on reviewing the macro and micro-forms of these polymer contaminants, demonstrating a lack of scientific data and also a lack of investigation regarding nano-sized polymers. It is these nano-polymers that have the greatest potential to cause the most harm to our oceans, waterways, and wildlife. This review has been especially ruthless in discussing nano-sized polymers, their ability to interact with organisms, and the potential for these nano-polymers to cause environmental damage in the marine environment. This review details the breakdown of macro-, micro-, and nano-polymer contamination, examining the sources, the interactions, and the fates of all of these polymer sizes in the environment. The main focus of this review is to perform a comprehensive examination of the literature of the interaction of nanoplastics with organisms, soils, and waters; followed by the discussion of toxicological issues. A significant focus of the review is also on current analytical characterisation techniques for nanoplastics, which will enable researchers to develop protocols for nanopolymer analysis and enhance understanding of nanoplastics in the marine environment."
"Microstructural and mechanical evolutions of sustainable cement blends containing fly ash and calcium carbonate whiskers induced by high temperature Compressive Strength; Reinforced Concrete; Flammability A novel kind of cement blend with high temperature resistance and favorable sustainability was developed in this paper. The physical and chemical changes due to high temperature exposure were examined in this sustainable cement paste containing fly ash (FA) and aragonite calcium carbonate whiskers (CW) as supplementary cementitious materials. High flexural strength is demonstrated before 400 Â°C because FA has pozzolanic effect, self-cementitious properties and potentials to react with CW under hydrothermal condition. When the exposure temperature is above 400 Â°C, especially above 800 Â°C, high residual properties and less deterioration are observed in flexural and compressive strengths and elastic modulus, mainly because FA is involved in the sintering process and formation of ceramic phases. In summary, the sustainable cementitious composites studied in this paper are very promising to have high temperature resistance to reduce fire damage on constructions and at the same time lower carbon dioxide footprint of cement manufacture."
"Dystopias for discourse: The role of the artist in a rapidly reconfiguring city Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work This paper grew out of a collaborative research project with Knox City Council, a local authority located on the eastern fringe of Melbourne (Australia) around 35 kilometres from the city centre. It articulates the role site-responsive artworks can play in interrogating the individual impact of climate change and new and old technologies on specific communities by exploring the development and reception of Section 32, an immersive performance installation that converted an ordinary suburban home into a speculative vision of the Australian suburbs, somewhere at the end of the 21st century. Located in an area undergoing rapid population increase, and therefore reconstruction, where residents had little opportunity to engage in a discourse about the planning process, Section 32 became a critical platform for discussion, revealing a public sentiment that was at odds with what local government was seeing in the local press."
"Transformative Advertising Research: Reimagining the Future of Advertising Marketing; Consumer Culture; Netnography The 50th anniversary of the Journal of Advertising launch is an opportune moment to dialogue among the past, present, and future and offer a fruitful vision for the possibilities of advertising. In this paper, we advance a new subfield that we call transformative advertising research (TAR). TAR examines problems and opportunities across the advertising system with the goal of transforming it toward better outcomes, namely cultivating individual, institutional, and societal well-being. We present a conceptual framework on TAR, informed by institutional theory, that highlights the transformational insights revealed in the intersections and interactions between institutional actors at the micro level, advertising institutions at the meso level, and sociocultural forces at the macro level and the resulting well-being outcomes. To illustrate our framework, we focus on a long-standing topical issue within advertisingâ€”gender inequalityâ€”that holds significant implications for well-being. In conceptualizing advertising as an institution, (1) we propose a new subfield of advertising we name TAR and (2) we present a framework that reveals the system complexities within the advertising ecosystem and allows for a clear vision of potential transformative outcomes, which (3) can guide and inspire scholars and practitioners with directions to engage in social change."

"The Environmental Kuznets Curve in the OECD: 1870–2014 Environmental Kuznets Curve; China; Trade Openness Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions play an important role in global warming. Consequently, studying the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic development is important, especially when viewed from a historical perspective. We test the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for a panel of 20 OECD nations, dating back to the first globalization boom in the nineteenth century. Utilising recently developed panel data estimators that account for cross-sectional dependence and parameter heterogeneity, for the period 1870 to 2014, we find support for the EKC hypothesis for the panel as a whole with three of our preferred four estimators, with turning points in income per capita that lie between $18,955 and $89,540 (in 1990 US$). Country-specific results, however, only provide mixed support for the EKC hypothesis. Specifically, we find evidence of an EKC for nine of the 20 countries, with five exhibiting a traditional inverted U-shaped relationship, three exhibiting an N-shaped relationship and one, an inverted N-shaped relationship."
"Potential of power generation from chicken waste-based biodiesel, economic and environmental analysis: Bangladesh’s perspective Transesterification; Catalyst; Rubber Seed Oil This study outlined the potential of biodiesel production from chicken fat waste and electricity generation from biodiesel on the scenario of remote region, Kuakata, located at southeastern Bangladesh based on the cost comparison between diesel and biodiesel-based power generation by HOMER software. The main objective of this case study was to address an integrated simulation-based research outcome to manage chicken skin waste (fat) for biodiesel, generate electricity from the biodiesel and present the potential of greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction from environment by product implementation. Approximate electric load profile of Kuakata and comprehensive emission modeling for this region has been performed by fuel-switching model and RETScreen Expert software. The simulation outcomes presented that 492,695 L/year biodiesel can be produced from chicken skin waste in Kuakata and converted into 883 MWh electricity per annum. The operating cost was 188,062 $/year, and cost of energy production was 0.214 $/kWh. The outcomes from this simulation modeling also demonstrated that the annual fuel consumption for base case is 3.7 kWh/m2 while 1.5 kWh/m2 is for proposed case with the reduction of 2.2 kWh/m2 per year. The calculation and simulation results also presented 70.3% GHG reduction in the region which presented drastic drop of environmental pollution."
"The role of water utilities in urban greening: A case study of Melbourne, Australia Stormwater; Green Infrastructure; Water Melbourne's â€œGreening the Westâ€ (GTW) initiative is a successful example of water utilities actively supporting urban greening through facilitating collaboration between stakeholders. GTW was convened by City West Water in 2011, to bring together 23 partner organisations to protect and enhance urban greening to support community wellbeing. This research involved interviews to determine how GTW works, its challenges, factors for success, achievements, areas for improvement, future directions, and implications. It is found that the existence of GTW has resulted in an additional one million trees planted in Melbourne's western suburbs, and has caused a significant cultural shift within local government."
"Designer Ecosystems for the Anthropocene—Deliberately Creating Novel Ecosystems in Cultural Landscapes Anthropocene; Climate Change; Environment Crisis Accepting that nature and culture are intricately co-evolved has profound implications for the ethical, legal, philosophical and pragmatic dimensions of social and environmental policy. The way we think about nature affects how we understand and manage ecosystems. While the ideals of preserving wilderness and conserving ecosystems have motivated much conservation effort to date, achieving these ideals may not be feasible under Anthropocene conditions unless communities accept custodial responsibilities for landscapes and other species. This paperâ€™s origins are in the authorâ€™s work with the Martuwarra Fitzroy River Council representing Indigenous traditional owners in Australiaâ€™s Kimberley region. These landscapes, shaped by 60,000 years of human occupation, interweave knowledge, laws and governance regimes, and material and spiritual connections with country. This interweaving offers insights into options for dealing with humanityâ€™s complex sustainability challenges. The paper also draws on the literature about cultural landscapes, ecological design, agroecology and permaculture to explore options for applying ecological design as a planning and problem-solving framework. The paper concludes that design-based approaches offer significant opportunities for using ecological science to integrate conservation and production in agricultural landscapes in ways that can meet human needs while also conserving biodiversity under climate change."

"Cycling behaviour in 17 countries across 6 continents: levels of cycling, who cycles, for what purpose, and how far? Bicycling; Bike; Cyclist International comparisons of cycling behaviour have typically been limited to high-income countries and often limited to the prevalence of cycling, with lack of discussions on demographic and trip characteristics. We used a combination of city, regional, and national travel surveys from 17 countries across the six continents, ranging from years 2009 through 2019. We present a descriptive analysis of cycling behaviour including level of cycling, trip purpose and distance, and user demographics, at the city-level for 35 major cities (>1 million population) and in urbanised areas nationwide for 11 countries. The Netherlands, Japan and Germany are among the highest cycling countries and their cities among the highest cycling cities. In cities and countries with high cycling levels, cycling rates tend to be more equal between work and non-work trips, whereas in geographies with low cycling levels, cycling to work is higher than cycling for other trips. In terms of cycling distance, patterns in high- and low-cycling geographies are more similar. We found a strong positive association between the level of cycling and womenâ€™s representation among cyclists. In almost all geographies with cycling mode share greater than 7% women made as many cycle trips as men, and sometimes even greater. The share of cycling trips by women is much lower in geographies with cycling mode shares less than 7%. Among the geographies with higher levels of cycling, children (<16 years) are often overrepresented. Older adults (>60 years) remain underrepresented in all geographies but have relatively better representation where levels of cycling are high. In low-cycling settings, females are underrepresented across all the age groups, and more so when older than 16 years. With increasing level of cycling, representation of females improves across all the age groups, and most significantly among children and older adults. Clustering the cities and countries into homogeneous cycling typologies reveals that high cycling levels always coincide with high representation of females and good representations of all age groups. In low-cycling settings, it is the reverse. We recommend that evaluations of cycling policies include usage by gender and age groups as benchmarks in addition to overall use. To achieve representation across different age and gender groups, making neighbourhoods cycling friendly and developing safer routes to school, should be equally high on the agenda as cycling corridors that often cater to commuting traffic."
"Aquatic plants, landoltia punctata, and azolla filiculoides as bio‐converters of wastewater to biofuel Araceae; Bioremediation; Landoltia Punctata The aquatic plants, Azolla filiculoides, and Landoltia punctate, were used as complementing phytoremediators of wastewater containing high levels of phosphate, which simulates the effluents from textile, dyeing, and laundry detergent industries. Their complementarities are based on differences in capacities to uptake nitrogen and phosphate components from wastewater. Sequential treatment by L. punctata followed by A. filiculoides led to complete removal of NH4, NO3, and up to 93% reduction of PO4. In experiments where L. punctata treatment was followed by fresh L. punctata, PO4 concentration was reduced by 65%. The toxicity of wastewater assessed by shrimps, Paratya australiensis, showed a fourâ€fold reduction of their mortality (LC50 value) after treatment. Collected dry biomass was used as an alternative carbon source for heterotrophic marine protists, thraustochytrids, which produced up to 35% dry weight of lipids rich in palmitic acid (50% of total fatty acids), the key fatty acid for biodiesel production. The fermentation of treated L. punctata biomass by Enterobacter cloacae yielded up to 2.14 mol H2/mole of reduced sugar, which is comparable with leading terrestrial feedstocks. A. filiculoides and L. punctata can be used as a new generation of feedstock, which can treat different types of wastewater and represent renewable and sustainable feedstock for bioenergy production."
"Towards the spectral mapping of plastic debris on beaches Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Floating and washed ashore marine plastic debris (MPD) is a growing environmental challenge. It has become evident that secluded locations including the Arctic, Antarctic, and remote islands are being impacted by plastic pollution generated thousands of kilometers away. Optical remote sensing of MPD is an emerging field that can aid in monitoring remote environments where in-person observation and data collection is not always feasible. Here we evaluate MPD spectral features in the visible to shortwave infrared regions for detecting varying quantities of MPD that have accumulated on beaches using a spectroradiometer. Measurements were taken from a range of in situ MPD accumulations ranging from 0.08% to 7.94% surface coverage. Our results suggest that spectral absorption features at 1215 nm and 1732 nm are useful for detecting varying abundance levels of MPD in a complex natural environment, however other absorption features at 931 nm, 1045 nm and 2046 nm could not detect in situ MPD. The reflectance of some in situ MPD accumulations was statistically different from samples that only contained organic debris and sand between 1.56% and 7.94% surface cover; however other samples with similar surface cover did not have reflectance that was statistically different from samples containing no MPD. Despite MPD being detectable against a background of sand and organic beach debris, a clear relationship between the surface cover of MPD and the strength of key absorption features could not be established. Additional research is needed to advance our understanding of the factors, such as type of MPD assemblage, that contribute to the bulk reflectance of MPD contaminated landscapes."
"A multicriteria analysis approach for evaluating the performance of agriculture decision support systems for sustainable agribusiness Farmers Knowledge; Decision Support Systems; Decision Making Agriculture decision support systems (DSSs) play an important role in facilitating evidenceâ€based agricultural decisionâ€making for improving agribusiness productivity. Evaluating and selecting the most appropriate agriculture DSS for sustainable agribusiness is, however, challenging due to the existence of production and marketing alternatives, a variety of objective functions from economic to lifestyle to longâ€term sustainability, and the subjectiveness and imprecision involved in the evaluation process. To help decision makers effectively deal with these issues, this paper presents a multicriteria analysis approach for evaluating and selecting the most appropriate agriculture DSS for sustainable agribusiness. The subjective assessments of decision makers in the evaluation process are formulated using linguistic variables approximated by fuzzy numbers. The concept based on the positive and the negative ideal solutions is applied for producing a performance index value for every agriculture DSS alternative across all evaluation criteria based on which the most appropriate agriculture DSS is. An empirical study is presented for demonstrating the stepâ€wise process for evaluating and selecting the most appropriate agriculture DSS for sustainable agribusiness. The outcome from the performance evaluation process allows agribusinesses to effectively adopt appropriate agriculture DSSs for achieving competitive advantages."
"Monitoring and evaluating the social and psychological dimensions that contribute to privately protected area program effectiveness Easement; Private Lands; Landowners Privately protected areas (PPAs) make important contributions towards global conservation goals. As with any protected area, PPAs must be monitored for effectiveness at protecting and managing biodiversity. However, the key drivers of maintaining and improving the effectiveness of PPAs are often social, particularly for conservation covenants and easements that are owned and managed by private landholders. In Australia, we surveyed 527 covenant landholders across three states (New South Wales, Tasmania, and Victoria), to provide a benchmark for monitoring and evaluation activities. We found that landholders are mainly motivated to participate in order to protect their land in perpetuity, but come to expect financial and technical assistance as a benefit of the program. While 71.1% (n = 344) reported achieving their land management goals, 44.7% (n = 242) of landholders struggle with covenant management because of age, and financial and time constraints. Covenant landholders are generally satisfied with the program (92%). A subset (8%) of landholders feels disaffected with their participation, relating to their perceived inability to personally manage the biodiversity on their land, and the lack of interaction they have with representatives of covenanting organizations. Where compliance monitoring and semi-annual technical assistance is limited, some landholders are concerned that the efficacy of the covenant is reduced. To increase effectiveness we suggest that PPA programs regularly monitor landholder satisfaction and management needs, schedule conservation actions based on landholder capacity, and utilize landholder networks to spread information and foster communities of stewardship. Additionally, given the older demographics of landholders, programs should engage in PPA successional planning."
"The daughter-in-law questions remittances: changes in the gender of remittances among Indian migrants to Australia Transnationalism; Human Migration; Dual Citizenship In this article, I present a cross-generational analysis of the gendered meanings and politics surrounding monetary remittances. Indian female migrants to Australia, who contribute significantly to household incomes, have recently started to question the sources and directions of remittances. This happens when the woman's earnings are sent, without consultation, to the husband's parents for luxuries, while the family in Australia is struggling. Women in paid work also want to send their earnings to their own parents, particularly if there is financial need. Remittances have become a testing ground for the traditional belief that the husband and his family own the money in the patrilineal marital household. It is possible to interpret male control of remittances without consultation as a form of financial abuse of the wife in the sending household. The article draws on two qualitative studies on five decades of Indian migration to Australia covering 203 people from 112 families."
"Bodies of/at Work: How Women of Colour Experienced Their Workplaces and Have Been Expected to ‘Perform’ During the COVID-19 Pandemic Intersectionality; Feminism; Social Location Almost 50 years ago, Edward Said wrote on â€˜the otherâ€™ in relation to race and gender in his path-breaking book Orientalism (1978). While much has evolved around notions of gendered and racialised otherness since then, Saidâ€™s conceptualisation still resonates today. Our paper reports on a 2020/2021 survey of Women of Colour in the Australian workplace. The survey was conducted during the pandemic by Women of Colour Australia, a not-for-profit group, working with the lead author. We focus on the qualitative answers from participants, many of which detail sometimes painful and extremely personal workplace experiences. More than 500 Women of Colour, including seven per cent who were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, completed the survey. Sixty per cent said they had experienced discrimination in the workplace, despite 59 per cent of participants saying their workplace had a Diversity and Inclusion policy. Participants had to â€˜performâ€™ their identities whilst being subjected to intersectional issues of racism and sexism, some of which the pandemic exacerbated. Our paper describes the harmful ramifications of gendered othering of Women of Colour for Australian organisations and society in the years of the pandemic."
"Extending the testing to a range of wastewater samples from regional Victoria The present work will extend the current project being conducted under the auspices of Water Research Australia and supported by South East Water. Currently, the project concentrates on South East Water wastewater samples and treatment process. Through the proposed work with Goulburn Valley Water, the technology will be tested on a range of wastewaters from a very different catchment and wastewater treatment process and thus its wider applicability determined. This will strengthen the major outcome of this project: the development of a systematic approach for selection of the most appropriate algae and technology configuration for nutrient removal, biogas production and overall cost."
"Harnessing algae for high rate municipal wastewater treatment: developing immobilised algae systems (student Matthew Kube) In this project, algae in suspended, biofilm and immobilised systems will be compared for their
efficacy to remove C, N and P from wastewater, and the technical and economic benefits of the
different options will be determined. As different algal species exhibit different capacities to remove
C, N and P, a systematic approach for selecting the most appropriate species for nutrient removal,
biogas production, and overall cost for treating wastewaters of different characteristics will be
developed."
"Caretakers' perceptions and willingness-to-pay for complementary food in urban and rural Cambodia Malnutrition; Child Nutrition Disorders; Stunting Inadequate child nutrition during the first â€˜1000 daysâ€™ is widespread in Cambodia, resulting in a high prevalence of child malnutrition. Access to processed complementary food in packages (PCFP) may support caretakers in improving diet of young children. This study aimed to evaluate the caretakers' preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for PCFP in Cambodia. The study was conducted in urban and rural settings, involving 520 caretakers with children aged 7â€“24 months in Phnom Penh (urban) and Prey Veng (rural). Four PCFPs were included: a commercial brand, a social-commercial brand, a worldwide distributed fortified complementary food aid product (CSB++) and an experimental fortified rice-and-fish-based PCFP developed in Cambodia (WF-L). Sensory analysis was conducted for all products, stated WTP was assessed for three products (excluding CSB++) and actual WTP experiment was conducted on WF-L only. Our results show that overall, WF-L was preferred by the rural participants over food aid CSB++. Further improvements in the organoleptic qualities of WF-L should focus on consistency and taste. The participants were, on average, willing to pay 1,667 Cambodian riel (KHR, $0.4) and 1,192 KHR ($0.3) in urban and rural settings, respectively, for 35 g of WF-L. We also found that despite being nutritionally inadequate, most participants considered homemade porridge to be healthier, more practical and preferred by the children. Therefore improving the quality of homemade foods merits urgent consideration. When applying PCFP in nutrition programmes as a supplementary option to homemade complementary foods, locally produced products could be a more viable supplementary option than global food aid."
"Biodiversity offsetting can relocate nature away from people: An empirical case study in Western Australia Greenspace; Green Infrastructure; National Parks Regular contact with nature provides multiple health benefits for people, but biodiversity is declining fast in an urbanizing world. Biodiversity offsets are implemented to compensate for the negative residual impacts of economic development projects on biodiversity, but the impacts on people who stand to lose biodiversity from their local environment are rarely considered. Offsetting typically involves creating, restoring or protecting biodiversity values at a specified site that can be located some distance away from the development site. In this article, we explore whether any relocation of nature is occurring due to development and offsets in Western Australia (WA); a jurisdiction with one of the world's few spatially referenced and comprehensive public offset registers. We analyzed data from 158 projects within the WA Environmental Offsets Register. We compared the location of development sites within 50 km (the urban and peri urban zone) and 500 km (~one day's drive) of the central business district (CBD) of Perth with the associated offset sites. The development and offset process together can be considered to contribute to a loss of urban nature as the offset sites tended to be further away from urban areas than the associated development sites. The offset sites were also located in significantly lower population density areas. However, offsets increased the publicly accessible land area by changing land ownership and creating amenity benefit by improving nature values on public land. Nevertheless, it is unclear to what extent relocation of nature further from people is balanced by increased public access to nature. In order to maintain nature connectedness, ecosystem service delivery and environmental justice in cities, we argue offset policies should require spatial proximity between impact and offset sites."
"Design and optimized fabrication techniques for highly-efficient dielectric meta-optical Airy beam generators Berry Phase; Holograms; Optics Dielectric meta-surface optical elements are of interest for a variety of interests, one of which is due to their high efficiency. Elements with binary structures that are easy to fabricate can have more than two phase levels, unlike diffractive elements. Previously reported work on meta-surfaces for complex light generation has focused mainly on beams with orbital angular momentum or Bessel beams. A few papers also talk about Airy beams. The latter have been found to have important applications in areas such as light sheet microscopy. These earlier papers describe the meta-surfaces in detail without dwelling on the various design and fabrication steps required to achieve a highly efficient element. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the design process in detail and highlight the key parameters that must be carefully optimized for successful fabrication. Finally, test results of a highly efficient, dielectric meta-surface cubic phase plate (CPP) are presented. The element has 8 phase levels and generates an Airy beam at the wavelength of 1064 nm. The focus of this work is to present a detailed step-by-step design flow, as well as the means by which to optimize the fabrication of those 8 levels. The phase variation is achieved by a change in the lateral dimensions. While the sizes are unique for each phase level, they are all sub-micron and this is where the fabrication challenge lies."
"Dendritic cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells fully responsive to stimulation via toll-like receptor 4 are rapidly induced from bone-marrow cells by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor Cancer; Myeloid Cells; Adoptive Transfer Dendritic cells (DCs) are commonly generated from bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) alone or in combination with interleukin 4 (IL-4). These cells are often harvested post day 5, when they acquire maturation markers and can stimulate T cells. Apart from DCs, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are also found within these cultures. However, little is known about the functional characteristics of DCs and MDSCs before day 5. Herein, using a murine model, it is shown that early DCs and MDSCs, even in cultures with GM-CSF alone, upregulate fully maturation and activation surface molecules in response to the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Despite initially displaying lower marker expression levels, these cells efficiently induced T cell stimulation and cytokine production. Interestingly, Gr-1int MDSCs increased their T cell co-stimulatory activity upon TLR4 stimulation. Additionally, early DCs and MDSCs exhibited differential endocytic capacity for viral sized nanoparticles and bacterial sized microparticles. DCs internalized both particle sizes, whilst MDSCs only internalized the larger microparticles, with reduced endocytic activity over time in the culture. These findings have unveiled an important role for the rapid initiation of productive immunity by GM-CSF, with promising implications for future vaccine and DC immunotherapy developments."
"Temperature shocks and energy poverty: Findings from Vietnam Energy; Energy Poverty; Fuelwood Globally, billions of people live in energy poverty without the means to access affordable and clean energy which are fundamental to sustainable development. Climate change is aggravating increasing demand for energy through a general rise in temperatures as well as through short periods of unusually high heat. This paper examines the impact of temperature shocks on energy poverty in Vietnam. Using data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (2010 to 2016) and data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts it finds temperature shocks lead to increases in a measure of multidimensional energy poverty. This finding is robust to different measures of temperature shocks. Households in the North and Central coast regions of Vietnam are most prone to the impacts of temperature shocks as well as households located in rural areas. Further findings suggest that temperature shocks impact on energy poverty through reducing agricultural output."
"Transnational drug trafficking in Southeast Asia: identifying national limitations to look for regional changes Oceans And Seas; Pirates; Gulf of Guinea Over its fifty years of established existence beginning in 1967, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has expounded its consolidated and integrated model in political relations, economic developments, and cultural values. However, confronted by threats to global security, ASEAN has also faced the complex impacts of transnational narcotics trafficking (TransNT). The study uses grey literature as secondary data to illustrate the current situations of TransNT in Southeast Asia by way of examining drug trafficking starting from the original countries (Myanmar) through the transit points (Vietnam) to final destination countries (Malaysia). Besides reviewing more than four decades of collaboration, the paper analyses ASEAN's milestones in building its cooperative mechanism and assesses its institutional framework for combatting TransNT with specific initiatives. The study notes the main barriers and practical challenges that constrain the process of regional cooperation. Some brief recommendations are also suggested for further research in the near future to enhance regional cooperation in combatting transnational crimes."
"Feasibility of microalgae as feedstock for alternative fuel in Malaysia: A review Biofuel; Nannochloropsis; Chlorella Sorokiniana Biodiesel is an attractive fuel replacement for diesel engine in Malaysia. The application of biodiesel as fuel-blend has been implemented commercially in transport sector in the country. Among various potential feedstock for biodiesel production, microalgae have been appeared as a promising source since a decade due to its' high biomass productivity, rapid growth rate, large amount of lipid content, capability of high CO2 capture and sequestration as well as suitable geographical location to be harvested. The main objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of microalgae harvesting in Malaysia to produce biodiesel and potential to implement microalgae-biodiesel as commercial transportation fuel. This study demonstrated the current scenario of overall biodiesel production and application in Malaysia. Since Malaysia is the world's second-largest oil palm producer, exploitation of edible palm oil for the making of biodiesel is to be blamed as the cause of soaring food price; therefore, the country is currently looking for 3rd generation biofuel sources and microalgae has been preferred for this purpose. Therefore, insight of the significance of microalgae cultivation for this purpose, suitable microalgae candidates and possible feasibility of microalgae biodiesel have been delineated in this review study. Prospects and challenges to implement microalgae biodiesel have also been emphasized in this study. Therefore, the advantages and limitations of this biodiesel can be transparent to government and non-government sectors. Thus, this study can re-direct both sectors in future. Consequently, it may contribute setting an appropriate government policy to encourage microalgae for biodiesel production to sustain the local biofuel and secure economic growth, energy security and improve environmental conditions in near future."

"Are sterols useful for the identification of sources of faecal contamination in shellfish? A case study Cholestanols; Organic Matter; Sterols This work aimed to identify the major source(s) of faecal pollution impacting Salcott Creek oyster fisheries in the UK through the examination of the sterol profiles. The concentration of the major sewage biomarker, coprostanol, in water overlying the oysters varied between 0.01 Î¼g Lâˆ’1 and 1.20 Î¼g Lâˆ’1. The coprostanol/epicoprostanol ratio ranged from 1.32 (September) to 33.25 (February), suggesting that human sewage represents the key input of faecal material into the estuary. However, a correlation between the sterol profile of water above the oysters with that of water that enters from Tiptree Sewage Treatment Works (r = 0.82), and a sample from a site (Quinces Corner) observed to have a high population of Brent geese (r = 0.82), suggests that both sources contribute to the faecal pollution affecting the oysters. In identifying these key faecal inputs, sterol profiling has allowed targeted management practices to be employed to ensure that oyster quality is optimised."
"Integrating spatially realistic infrastructure impacts into conservation planning to inform strategic environmental assessment Road Kills; Collision; Wildlife Infrastructures such as roads and pipelines have environmental impacts that diffuse far beyond the local development footprint, including fragmenting habitat or changing hydrology. Broad-scale diffuse impacts are challenging to incorporate into conservation planning and strategic environmental assessment due to difficulties in determining how impacts spread across landscapes. We built curves representing expert-elicited magnitudes and spatial extents of direct and diffuse impacts of infrastructure on biodiversity groups, to incorporate these impacts into a spatial conservation prioritization. We demonstrate how different prioritization outputs inform different steps of the impact assessment mitigation hierarchy. In southern Australia we find the diffuse-impact footprint to be four times higher than direct (i.e., local) infrastructure impacts, with >75,000 km2 of spatial priority areas for mitigation and >37,000 km2 of spatial priority areas for offsets potentially missed if diffuse impacts are ignored. Understanding both direct and diffuse infrastructure impacts will avoid inefficient spatial allocation of environmental mitigation, restoration, and offsetting efforts."
"Integrated Heat Vulnerability Assessment Toolkit for Australian Cities (Administered by University of Melbourne) This proposed project aims to establish a first nation-wide, dynamic and interactive heat vulnerability assessment toolkit with enhanced workflow, automated analysis and modelling tools, so the indicators and indices can be updated and constructed by the users to serve more applications. The project will advance the methods and technological infrastructure used to derive assessment metrics from
satellite images and open source environmental, social demographic data using machine learning and GIS. In-depth knowledge on urban heat can be generated by modelling the relationships between environmental and social demographic factors. The toolkit will enable researchers and decision makers to access heat exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capability indicators for intervention
strategies. It will empower Australians with information and intelligence for better heat mitigation and adaptation. The objectives are to:
1. Develop tools for fusing satellite images and calculating land surface temperature and urban heat island effect;
2. Develop tools to construct heat sensitivity, heat adaptive capability indicators and composite heat vulnerability index;
3. Enable modeling of the relationships between heat, environmental and social-economic factors 
A series tools and datasets will be added to AURIN eInfrastructure including ""Calculate urban heat island"", ""Calculate heat sensitivity"", ""Calculate heat adaptive capability"", ""Heat Vulnerability Index"" and ""Model cooling effect"". Deep learning functions will be integrated in the toolkit."

"Benevolent and hostile sexism differentially predicted by facets of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation Social Dominance Orientation; Authoritarianism; Political Attitudes Despite progress towards equality on many fronts, sexism remains a problem. If sexism is to be combatted, an understanding of the attitudes underlying its various expressions is required. Previous research has strongly linked sexism to right-wing authoritarianism (a preference for collective security) and social dominance orientation (a preference for group-based hierarchy). Both are often considered unitary constructs, however recent attention to their facets has revealed finer details. This study breaks ground by utilising these facets to predict benevolent sexism (paternalistic attitudes towards women) and hostile sexism (antipathy towards women) in an Australian sample (N = 229). Both sexism variables were significantly predicted by two of the five attitude facets. For benevolent sexism, these were traditionalism and dominance, and for hostile sexism, they were conservatism and anti-egalitarianism. Hostile sexism was also predicted by gender. These findings add to the theoretical understanding of ambivalent sexism, have implications for addressing sexism in society, and support calls for future research to utilise the facets of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation."
"Porous organic polymer enriched in Re functional units and Lewis base sites for efficient CO2photoreduction Organic Polymers; Triazines; Porous Photocatalytic reduction of CO2into valuable chemicals or fuels is one of the most promising solutions to mitigate climate change. However, sound photocatalysts with sensitive responses to light, efficient enrichment and reduction of CO2have not been well explored. Herein, we design and synthesize a porous organic polymer (POP), BTN-Re (BTN = 2,2â€²-bipyridine triazine network) out of two key units,i.e.Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl (bpy = 2,2â€²-bipyridine) and melamine. Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl offers excellent CO2reduction ability of functional units to BTN-Re; meanwhile, the abundant Lewis base sites brought in by melamine promote capture of CO2contributing to the reduction of CO2. Steady-state fluorescence tests confirm that integrating Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl into BTN-Re skeletons efficiently inhibits electron-hole recombination. It is evident that BTN-Re exhibits an outstanding ability to photo-reduce CO2, with an average rate of 500.7 Î¼mol gâˆ’1hâˆ’1under visible light irradiation. This work provides a novel strategy for designing POP-based materials as photoreduction catalysts to reduce CO2"

"Cleaning up Forever Chemicals in Construction: Informing Industry Change Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Per-and polyfluorinated alkyl substance (PFAS) contamination has been found in the construction spoil of many major projects, and there is growing concern about the health and environmental implications of these â€œforeverâ€ chemicals. In a context where construction and tunneling have experienced substantial growth, Australia and other countries are still developing their PFAS management. This study used convergent interviews to surface the key common issues that are associated with the management of PFAS contamination in the construction industry. The construction industry appears stuck in their ways and extremely financially driven. Regulation is not working because of poor enforcement and policing from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA could look to employ individuals with more construction industry experience in order to become a strong regulator in the industry, as well as to streamlining decision-making processes, while maintaining quality. To speed up changes in the management of PFASs within the construction industry, large organizations could be targeted by the relevant sustainability rating scheme, and there could be further use of the alliance models to research, develop, and implement PFAS treatment methods."

"The Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture: Findings from Households in Vietnam Crops; CERES (Experiment); Climate Change Impact This paper examines farm household-level impacts of climate change by examining the relationship between climatic variables and Vietnamese agricultural output. The Ricardian technique is applied with panel data which accounts for both adaptation strategies and household characteristics. This study proposes a two-stage Hsiao model to correct for collinearity between climatic variables and individual effects. The results show that in the dry season, increases in temperatures are beneficial to all farms in the warmer southern regions, while increases in precipitation will damage only irrigated farms in the Central and South regions. The impact of higher temperature in the wet season is similar, except that it will negatively affect net revenue of irrigated farms in the long run. More rainfall in the wet season will increase net revenue in the North region only. Finally, this study combines the estimated results with future climate scenarios to predict how future changes in climate will affect farmers on aggregate."
"Research progress on levoglucosan production via pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and its effective recovery from bio-oil Pyrolysis; Briquettes; Pelleting Production of high value biochemicals from lignocellulose biomass via pyrolysis, particularly levoglucosan (LG) has received immense attention in recent years. LG production via fast pyrolysis has recorded a continuous development over the past years, which demands a state-of-the-art review, covering the LG recovery methods and commercial feasibility analysis of the process. This paper provides an in-depth review of the progress and current status of bio-LG production with a focus on formation mechanisms, influential variables, recovery methods and techno-economic prospects. Based on the experimental findings of the previous studies, this review concluded that the LG yield from biomass via pyrolysis could be proposed as a function of biomass structural properties, cellulose content, inorganic minerals content as well as pyrolysis process conditions. An essential aspect of maximising the overall efficiency of LG production process is the adoption of efficient in-situ or post-pyrolysis LG extraction techniques, which has been critically reviewed for the first time. The paper also summarises the techno-commercial assessment studies of LG facility, highlighting the limiting factors towards the economic attractiveness of the process. Finally, the review highlights the knowledge gaps and provides future recommendations, which will be helpful for the improvement of productivity and economic feasibility of bio-LG production process."
"Seismicity and seismotectonics in and around Sri Lanka: a synoptic review Oceanic Crust; Bay of Bengal; Gondwana Seismicity and seismotectonics in and around Sri Lanka are reviewed, considering the country in both the local and regional contexts. Seismic activity reported within the country indicates a close correlation with the local geotectonic setup that comprises certain active features such as lineaments and faults, bedrock fractures, thrust/shear zones and tectonic movements of individual mini-plates. Seismicity in the regional context is discussed, evaluating identified active zones in the northern Indian Ocean surrounding the country. A large area of diffuse seismicity located south-southeast of Sri Lanka enclosing the northern part of the Ninetyeast Ridge, could be a dominant source of strong shallow intraplate earthquakes, and could render direct threats of striking large-magnitude events in close proximity to the country. The oceanic region west of Sri Lanka and continental region of southern peninsular India are not as active, more like dormant areas with sparse seismicity. However, seismogenic potential of these regions may not be completely ruled out, given evidence of previous isolated strong events."
"Connecting transport planning and early delivery outcomes for Melbourne?s new suburban residents. Melbourne?s fringes will accommodate half a million new homes, increasing housing stock by 30%, by 2051. Government planning policies such as Plan Melbourne and precinct structure plans promise transport choice, but in reality residents must drive everywhere. This project will measure transport policy goals against development on-the-ground; interview residents about their transport challenges; analyse current funding processes to explore what needs to change; and model early delivery of real transport options. Scenarios will demonstrate the cost and benefit implications of early and late transport provision and will examine novel funding approaches for walking, cycling, public transport infrastructure and services."
"Spatio-temporal assessment of social resilience to tropical cyclones in coastal Bangladesh Bangladesh; Cyclonic Storms; Disaster Tropical cyclones wreak havoc on the lives of coastal populations, especially in marginalised communities in developing countries where cyclone impacts are disproportionately lethal compared to developed countries. These populations must implement measures that enable them to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyclone impacts. Using empirical evidence, this study presents a spatio-temporally explicit, index-based assessment technique to assess social resilience to tropical cyclones. The key components of social resilience were extracted by Principal Component Analysis; distinct resilience indices were generated and mapped for the three disaster phases. The most influential components were then aggregated into an Effective Social Resilience Index (ESoRI), which was mapped across the study area. The technique was applied in a coastal sub-district of Bangladesh to demonstrate the approach. Basic preparedness training, emergency response, social bonding, and reconstruction and rehabilitation strongly influenced resilience in ways that corresponded closely to the phases of the disaster-management cycle: preparedness, response, and recovery. The spatial pattern of resilience revealed that social resilience varies significantly in time and space within a circumscribed locale. Importantly, areas close to the sea and rivers were found to be more resilient despite their high exposure to cyclones and lack of external support. This study will guide policymakers concerned with resilience building on a priority basis such as those working in resource-scarce conditions of developing countries."
"Modest ratios of fast food outlets to supermarkets and green grocers are associated with higher body mass index: Longitudinal analysis of a sample of 15,229 Australians aged 45 years and older in the Australian National Liveability Study Obesity; Farmers' Markets; Grocery Stores Food purchasing decisions are made within the context of the range of options available, yet most epidemiological studies focus upon single outlet types. Ratios of fast food outlets to supermarkets and green grocers were linked to addresses of 15,229 adults in the 45 and Up Study at baseline (2006â€“2008) and follow-up (2009â€“2010). Compared to having no fast food outlet but having healthy food outlets within 3.2 km from home, multilevel growth curves revealed that relative exposure>25% fast food outlets were associated with 0.36â€“1.19 kg/m 2 higher BMI (p<0.05). These associations were consistent as people aged. No associations were observed for food outlets<0.8 km."
"Towards zero-energy buildings in China: A systematic literature review Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation Zero-energy buildings have attracted interest worldwide as they consume less energy and can alleviate energy shortages caused by rapid economic development.

We expect this review to identify gaps and future directions for research and development, which will lead to new technologies, methods, policies, and standards that can be applied to zero-energy buildings."
"Facile route of fabricating long-term microbicidal silver nanoparticle clusters against shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Candida auris Silver Nanoparticles; Green Synthesis; Biofabrication Microbial contamination remains a significant issue for many industrial, commercial, and medical applications. For instance, microbial surface contamination is detrimental to numerous aspects of food production, infection transfer, and even marine applications. As such, intense scientific interest has focused on improving the antimicrobial properties of surface coatings via both chemical and physical routes. However, there is a lack of synthetic coatings that possess long-term microbiocidal performance. In this study, silver nanoparticle cluster coatings were developed on copper surfaces via an ion-exchange and reduction reaction, followed by a silanization step. The durability of the microbiocidal activity for these develped surfaces was tested against pathogenic bacterial and fungal species, specifically Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Candida auris, over periods of 1-and 7-days. It was observed that more than 90% of E. coli and C. auris were found to be non-viable following the extended exposure times. This facile material fabrication presents as a new surface design for the production of durable microbicidal coatings which can be applied to numerous applications."
"Opportunities and challenges in the development of monoethanolamine and its blends for post-combustion CO2 capture Carbon Dioxide; Nitrosamines; N,N-Bis(2-Hydroxyethyl)Glycine Post-combustion Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture (PCC) via amine absorption-stripping is an evolving technology towards mitigation of CO2 emissions. One of the major challenges in the technology development is the suitability of the solvent. Under the process operating conditions, irreversible reactions occur, thereby degrading the amine. The consequences of amine degradation are inevitable. The degradation products are harmful to the environment, increase the corrosion in the process equipment, cause fouling and ultimately make the process inefficient, hazardous and expensive. Monoethanolamine (MEA) is the benchmark solvent used and tested at industrial level for CO2 capture because of its high absorption rate and capacity to capture CO2 as well as medium to high resistance against oxidative and thermal degradation. This review reports degradation of MEA under process operating conditions, which includes up-to-dated list of degradation products, degradation kinetics and degradation pathways. Furthermore, degradation inhibition, computational studies, corrosivity as well as environmental concerns regarding the emissions of amine degradation products are critically reviewed. The objective of study is to provide researchers with a comprehensive knowledge on degradation of MEA, ways to reduce degradation, corrosion inhibition and understanding of environmental concerns for development of models for better understanding of behaviour of MEA and knowledge gaps."
"Assessing Seed Longevity of the Invasive Weed Navua Sedge (Cyperus aromaticus), by Artificial Ageing Germination; Desiccation; Cryopreservation Navua sedge (Cyperus aromaticus (Ridley) Mattf. & Kukenth) is a significant agricultural and environmental weed found in tropical island countries including north Queensland, Australia. It is a prolific seed producer and consequently forms a high-density seedbank, and therefore understanding the longevity and persistence of the seeds can provide critical information required for the management of this species. A laboratory-controlled artificial ageing experiment was conducted where the seeds were exposed to a temperature of 45 Â°C and 60% relative humidity for 125 days. Seeds were removed at various times (1, 2, 5, 9, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100 and 125 days) and their viability determined through standard germination tests. It took 20 days in the artificial ageing environment for the seeds to decline to 50% viability which indicates that Navua sedge has relatively short-lived persistent seeds. These findings will assist in developing a better understanding of the seedbank dynamics of this invasive species, allowing managers to tactically implement control strategies and prepare budgets for ongoing treatments, and have implications for the duration and success of management programs."
"Impacts of farmers' adaptation to drought and salinity intrusion on rice yield in Vietnam's Mekong Delta Crops; CERES (Experiment); Climate Change Impact Purpose: The Vietnamese Mekong River Delta (VMD) is one of the most affected deltas by climate change in the world. Several studies have investigated factors influencing farmers' climate change adaptation behaviors in the region; however, little is known about the effectiveness of such measures. This paper examines the determinants of adaptation strategies among VMD rice farmers and assesses the impacts of such practices on rice yield. Design/methodology/approach: Endogenous switching regressions were employed using a survey data of 300 rice-producing households in An Giang and Tra Vinh provinces in 2016. Findings: The results show that farmers receiving early disaster warnings are more likely to adopt adaptation measures to climate change. If nonadaptors had chosen to respond, their rice yield would have increased by 0.932 tons/ha/season. Research limitations/implications: The data sample is small and collected from two provinces in the VMD only; therefore, the results may be specific for the study sites. However, future research can adopt the proposed method for other regions. Originality/value: The study estimates the production impacts of farmers' decisions on whether or not to adapt to extreme climate events. The proposed approach allows for capturing both observed and unobserved behaviors."
"Maximum Likelihood-Based Measurement Noise Covariance Estimation Using Sequential Quadratic Programming for Cubature Kalman Filter Applied in INS/BDS Integration Cubature; Kalman Filter; Maneuvering Target Tracking With the completion of the Beidou-3 system (BDS) in China, INS/BDS integration will become a promising navigation and positioning strategy. However, due to the nonlinear propagation characteristic of INS error and inevitable involvement of inaccurate measurement noise statistics, it is difficult to achieve the optimal solution through the INS/BDS integration. This paper proposes a method of cubature Kalman filter (CKF) with the measurement noise covariance estimation by using the maximum likelihood principle to solve the abovementioned problem. It establishes an estimation model for measurement noise covariance according to the maximum likelihood principle, and then, its estimation is calculated by utilizing the sequential quadratic programming. The estimated measurement noise covariance will be fed back to the procedure of CKF to improve its adaptability. Simulation and comparison analysis verify that the proposed method can accurately estimate measurement noise covariance to effectively restrain its influence on navigation solution, leading to improved navigation performance for the INS/BDS integration."
"Policies and initiatives/programs that promote health and self-care in asylum seekers living in high income countries: a narrative review Mental Health; Torture; Asylum Purpose: This paper aims to identify health-care entitlements that exist for asylum seekers with chronic non-communicable disease (CNCD) that promote their health and self-care, and to explore health policies, initiatives and programmes with the potential to foster self-care in this populace. Design/methodology/approach: Narrative review of literature conducted by searching EMBASE, CINAHL, WEB OF SCIENCE and PSYCINFO databases for articles published from 2010 to 2021. Included articles focussed on policies, programmes or initiatives with the potential to promote health in adult asylum seekers residing in high-income countries. Studies inclusive of other migrant groups such as undocumented migrants and those with mental health conditions were excluded. Eleven studies fitting the inclusion criteria were assessed against the study objectives. Findings: Free access to health-care services and pharmaceutical products, free access to food banks and supermarket model food banks, English and cooking lessons, community integration training sessions and culturally competent health-care workers were found to promote health and self-care. There is little research on self-care and health promotion in adult asylum seekers with CNCD. CNCDs represent high burden of disease in asylum seekers but have a low priority in reported research. Originality/value: This narrative review is the first to explicitly focus on asylum seekers in high-income countries with CNCD, excluding mental health conditions, and to explore initiatives, programmes and policies that enhance health promotion to facilitate self-care in this populace."

"Comparing Australian garment and childcare homeworkers’ experience of regulation and representation ILO; Personnel; Right to Strike Labour markets in Australia have long been segmented by gender and race. This study compares two highly gendered and racially segmented labour markets, home-based family day care workers and garment homeworkers. The comparative cases examine the broader trends of migration, production and consumption that reinforce gender and racial stereotypes, and discourses that underpin representations that women workers are ideally suited to such work. We theorise the gender and racialised inequalities of homework based on the literature on invisibilisation and social reproduction to explore the vulnerable position of migrant women and the consequences of having limited options, such as legal and social protections and any capacity to collectively organise. Our analysis examines the roles and responses of institutions and conceptualises the socio-political factors that affect the characterisation of homework as non-work or as self-employed entrepreneurial activities. By mapping the differing regulatory trajectories of these two groups of homeworkers in terms of regulation and representation, we find both similarities and differences. While garment homeworkers have achieved recognition through legislation and social mobilisation, their circumstances leave them less likely to access such rights. By contrast, the failure to recognise family day care homeworkers, has left them to market forces. JEL code: J01."
"Compensation for land use deprivation in mining: an analysis of the laws and practices relating to land use deprivation compensation in Ghana’s mining sector Niger; Oil; Haram This article examines the laws and valuation methods that valuers apply in assessing compensation for land use deprivation in Ghanaâ€™s mining sector using two mining companies as case studies. We argue that analysing the valuation techniques applied in assessing compensation for land use deprivation in the context of current legal provisions facilitates a better understanding of the issues fuelling community dissatisfaction with compensation awards. Data pro-duced through document analysis and interviews with 39 farmers, government officials, chiefs, private valuers, and officials of Newmont Goldcorpâ€™s Ahafo Mine and Asanko Gold Ghana Limited were analysed in the context of the current legal framework for expropriation. Interview transcripts were coded based on themes and analysed using the constant comparison method. The findings reveal that the valuation techniques for assessing compensation for land use deprivation disregard fundamental compensation principles outlined under law. The study also exposes the weaknesses in the valuation techniques in assessing compensation for farmlands that mining may impair permanently. Towards ensuring fairness in compensating mining-impacted farmers, this study recommends additional legal directives to streamline the methods for assessing compensation for land use deprivation. The consequences of the limitations in the valuation methods on expropriated farmers are also discussed."
"Visual intelligence for safe vehicle operation in industrial environment The growing pressure of increasing productivity at variety of industrial workplaces translates to need for faster
industrial vehicles. At fruit and vegetable markets, forklift drivers and in construction sites, the crane operators and crews are all under pressure to move faster to meet the demands of the expected productivity increases. The
need for higher speed and the enormous cost (both in human and financial terms) of unsafe operations have generated opportunities for the deployment of intelligent safety devices.

"The policy and practice of designing healthy, equitable higher density Higher density housing is promoted to sustainably accommodate population growth; however in some Australian cities there is limited design and planning guidance on building designs or associated public amenity. Could this have implications for the quality, versatility and equity of the housing provided, and for the health and well-being of residents? This multidisciplinary project aims to produce new policy specific empirical evidence on the combined impact of policy guidance, on-ground implementation of building design criteria, and locational characteristics on residents well-being. Findings have the potential to change public policy to mandate the inclusion of health-enhancing design requirements in future higher density developments."
"Understanding and Addressing Everyday Sexisms in Australian Universities (administered by Edith Cowen University) This project aims to improve the ways in which gender-based discrimination is understood and addressed in Australian universities by employing a situated, intersectional, and creative approach to researching everyday sexisms. This project expects to use an innovative approach to generate new knowledge about everyday sexisms at the individual level and across disciplinary and university contexts. Expected outcomes include new gender equity practices that will assist universities to refine current programs, strategies, and policies capable of eliminating gender-based discrimination. This should provide significant benefits for Australian society, including women and gender diverse people working in universities."

STEM self-identity so they will be creators of their own futures."
"Female Financial Adviser Career Paths: Australia versus New Zealand The career gender imbalance for financial advisers in both Australia and New Zealand has been largely ignored by academics and practitioners alike. The marked underrepresentation of women in the sector is in stark contrast to the dominant male presence. Global evidence suggests that only one in five advisers is female (Chaplin, 2013; Forman and Salvi, 2018). Even more concerning is the fact that very few females progress to senior positions within the financial services sector (Ogden, McTavish, and McKean, 2006). This study will investigate the factors contributing to the significant disparity in the number of female advisers and the seniority of female advisers within the financial advice sector. 
The study will use in-depth qualitative interviews of financial advisers working in Australia and New Zealand to examine their career experiences and outline their perceptions of barriers and drivers to a financial advising career. Analysis will be informed by the more extensive gender research in accountancy (e.g. Whiting, Gammie, and Herbohn, 2015; Haynes, 2017; Kornberger, Carter and Ross-Smith, 2010)."

"Housing, neighbourhood and sociodemographic associations with adult levels of physical activity and adiposity: Baseline findings from the ENABLE London study Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Objectives The neighbourhood environment is increasingly shown to be an important correlate of health. We assessed associations between housing tenure, neighbourhood perceptions, sociodemographic factors and levels of physical activity (PA) and adiposity among adults seeking housing in East Village (formerly London 2012 Olympic/Paralympic Games Athletes' Village). Setting Cross-sectional analysis of adults seeking social, intermediate and market-rent housing in East Village. Participants 1278 participants took part in the study (58% female). Complete data on adiposity (body mass index (BMI) and fat mass %) were available for 1240 participants (97%); of these, a subset of 1107 participants (89%) met the inclusion criteria for analyses of accelerometer-based measurements of PA. We examined associations between housing sector sought, neighbourhood perceptions (covariates) and PA and adiposity (dependent variables) adjusted for household clustering, sex, age group, ethnic group and limiting long-standing illness. Results Participants seeking social housing had the fewest daily steps (8304, 95% CI 7959 to 8648) and highest BMI (26.0 kg/m 2 , 95% CI 25.5kg/m 2 to 26.5 kg/m 2 ) compared with those seeking intermediate (daily steps 9417, 95% CI 9106 to 9731; BMI 24.8 kg/m 2 , 95% CI 24.4 kg/m 2 to 25.2 kg/m 2 ) or market-rent housing (daily steps 9313, 95% CI 8858 to 9768; BMI 24.6 kg/m 2 , 95% CI 24.0 kg/m 2 to 25.2 kg/m 2 ). Those seeking social housing had lower levels of PA (by 19%-42%) at weekends versus weekdays, compared with other housing groups. Positive perceptions of neighbourhood quality were associated with higher steps and lower BMI, with differences between social and intermediate groups reduced by âˆ¼10% following adjustment, equivalent to a reduction of 111 for steps and 0.5 kg/m 2 for BMI. Conclusions The social housing group undertook less PA than other housing sectors, with weekend PA offering the greatest scope for increasing PA and tackling adiposity in this group. Perceptions of neighbourhood quality were associated with PA and adiposity and reduced differences in steps and BMI between housing sectors. Interventions to encourage PA at weekends and improve neighbourhood quality, especially among the most disadvantaged, may provide scope to reduce inequalities in health behaviour."

"Professionalisation and the spectacle of nature: Understanding changes in the visual imaginaries of private protected area organisations in Australia Payments For Ecosystem Services; Payment; China Imaginaries of protected areas as state-based fortresses have been challenged by expansion of the global nature conservation estate on non-government lands, notably in contexts such as Australia where neoliberal reform has been strong. Little is known about the implications of this change for the meanings, purposes and practices of nature conservation. Images are central to public understandings of nature conservation. We thus investigate the visual communication of environmental non-government organisations (ENGOs) involved in private protected areas in Australia, with particular focus on Bush Heritage Australia (BHA). We employ a three-part design encompassing quantitative and qualitative methods to study the visual imaginaries underlying nature conservation in BHA's magazines and the web homepages of it and four other ENGOs over 2004â€“2020. We find that visual imaginaries changed across time, as ENGOs went through an organisational process of professionalisation comprising three dynamics: legitimising, marketising, and differentiating. An imaginary of dedicated Western volunteer groups protecting scenic wilderness was replaced by the spectacle of uplifting and intimate individual encounters with native nature. Amenable to working within rather than transforming dominant political-economic structures, the new imaginary empowers professional ENGOs and their partners as primary carers of nature. It advertises a mediated access to spectacular nature that promises positive emotions and redemption for environmental wrongs to financial supporters of ENGOs. These findings reveal the role of non-government actors under neoliberal conditions in the use of visual representations to shift the meanings, purposes and practices of nature conservation."
"Psychometric testing of a set of patient-reported instruments to assess healthcare interventions for autistic adults Autistic Disorder; Autism; Lay Beliefs There is a growing recognition of the need for interventions to improve the healthcare of autistic adults. However, there is a dearth of validated measures to evaluate such interventions. Our objectives were to use a community-based participatory research approach to create an accessible set of patient- and proxy-reported instruments to measure healthcare outcomes and potential intervention targets in autistic adults and to assess the instrumentsâ€™ psychometric characteristics, including content validity, construct validity, and internal consistency reliability. We administered a survey to 244 autistic adults recruited from 12 primary care clinics in Oregon and California, USA (194 participating directly and 50 participating via a proxy reporter). Community partners ensured items were easy to understand and captured the intended construct. The Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education (AASPIRE) Visit Preparedness Scale, Healthcare Accommodations Scale, and Patientâ€“Provider Communication Scale were each found to have a single factor. The AASPIRE Health and Healthcare Self-Efficacy Scale had two factors: Individual Healthcare Self-Efficacy and Relationship-Dependent Healthcare Self-Efficacy. Both patient- and proxy-reported versions of all scales had good to excellent internal consistency reliability, with alphas ranging from 0.81 to 0.96. The scales were associated with the Barriers to Healthcare Checklist and the Unmet Healthcare Needs Checklist in the hypothesized directions. Lay Abstract: Interventions to improve healthcare for autistic adults are greatly needed. To evaluate such interventions, researchers often use surveys to collect data from autistic adults (or sometimes, their supporters), but few survey measures have been tested for use with autistic adults. Our objective was to create and test a set of patient- or proxy-reported survey measures for use in studies that evaluate healthcare interventions. We used a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, in partnership with autistic adults, healthcare providers, and supporters. We worked together to create or adapt survey measures. Three survey measures focus on things that interventions may try to change directly: (1) how prepared patients are for visits; (2) how confident they feel in managing their health and healthcare; and (3) how well the healthcare system is making the accommodations patients feel they need. The other measures focus on the outcomes that interventions may hope to achieve: (4) improved patientâ€“provider communication; (5) reduced barriers to care; and (6) reduced unmet healthcare needs. We then tested these measures in a survey of 244 autistic adults recruited from 12 primary care clinics in Oregon and California, USA (with 194 participating directly and 50 participating via a proxy reporter). Community partners made sure items were easy to understand and captured what was important about the underlying idea. We found the survey measures worked well in this sample. These measures may help researchers evaluate new healthcare interventions. Future research needs to assess whether interventions improve healthcare outcomes in autistic adults."
"Marine Bile Natural Products as Agonists of the TGR5 Receptor Obeticholic Acid; Bile Acids and Salts; Farnesoid X-Activated Receptor Agonism of the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor ""Takeda G-protein receptor 5""(TGR5) aids in attenuating cholesterol accumulation due to atherosclerotic progression. Although mammalian bile compounds can activate TGR5, they are generally weak agonists, and more effective compounds need to be identified. In this study, two marine bile compounds (5Î²-scymnol and its sulfate) were compared with mammalian bile compounds deoxycholic acid (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) using an in vitro model of TGR5 agonism. The response profiles of human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) transfected to overexpress TGR5 (HEK293-TGR5) and incubated with subcytotoxic concentrations of test compounds were compared to nontransfected HEK293 control cells using the specific calcium-binding fluorophore Fura-2AM to measure intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i release. Scymnol and scymnol sulfate caused a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i within TGR5 cells only, which was abolished by a specific inhibitor for GÎ±q protein (UBO-QIC). Sustained increases in [Ca2+]i were seen in both cell types with DCA exposure; this was unaffected by UBO-QIC, indicating that TGR5 activation was not involved. Exposure to UDCA did not alter [Ca2+]i, suggesting a lack of TGR5 bioactivity. These findings demonstrated that both scymnol and scymnol sulfate are novel agonists of TGR5 receptors, showing therapeutic potential for treating atherosclerosis."
"Selecting pinning nodes to control complex networked systems Complex Dynamical Networks; Time Lag; Exponential Synchronization One of the fundamental problems in pinning control of complex networks is selecting appropriate pinning nodes, such that the whole system is controlled. This is particularly useful for complex networks with huge numbers of nodes. Recent research has yielded several pinning node selection strategies, which may be efficient. However, selecting a set of pinning nodes and identifying the nodes that should be selected first remain challenging problems. In this paper, we present a network control strategy based on left Perron vector. For directed networks where nodes have the same in- and out-degrees, there has so far been no effective pinning node selection strategy, but our method can find suitable nodes. Likewise, our method also performs well for undirected networks where the nodes have the same degree. In addition, we can derive the minimum set of pinning nodes and the order in which they should be selected for given coupling strengths. Our proofs of these results depend on the properties of non-negative matrices and M-matrices. Several examples show that this strategy can effectively select appropriate pinning nodes, and that it can achieve better results for both directed and undirected networks."

The investigations will focus on achieving tunable plasmonic properties across a broad spectrum from UV to infrared light. Targets will be the creation of systems with low propagation losses or ultra-sensitivity towards environmental changes. The research outcomes will serve as a base to establish the next generation plasmonic communication and sensing systems with active on-chip controllability."
"A new framework for assessing the environmental impacts of circular economy friendly soil waste-based geopolymer cements Life Cycle Assessment; Carbon Dioxide; Cradle-To-Gate Portland cement is one of the principal constituents used as a building material and is responsible for high energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Any attempt to reduce cement usage would make savings in energy usage and GHG emissions. A case study of Portland cement (CEM-I) replacement using alkali activated soil filter cake as a geopolymer mortar is presented to demonstrate application of a three-stage GHG emission estimation and comparison methodology using a process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) study, with a focus on benchmarking environmental sustainability. Results indicate that the alkali activated soil filter cake reduced total GHG emissions by 31% compared with CEM-I, which equates to 110 kgCO2-eq/m3. Transportation by rail was found to be more sustainable compared with by road, with an overall higher GHG emission reduction of between 5 and 10%. For road transport, heavy goods vehicles (HGV) of between 3.5t and 5.7t recorded the highest GHG emissions whilst articulated lorries recorded the lowest GHG emissions. Furthermore, the results also demonstrated that a bulk carrier is the most environmentally sustainable option for overseas raw material transportation. Monte-Carlo simulations signified the likelihood of achieving lowered GHG emissions when considering commercial production and inventory changes across different countries varies from 18% to 71%. These results highlight the importance of critical analysis of several factors which contribute towards overall environmental sustainability, prior to decision making on sustainable materials. Further research is encouraged on developing processes and methodologies to prioritize selection of sustainable materials to optimize sustainable benefits."
"Characterisation of the intestinal microbiota of commercially farmed saltwater crocodiles, Crocodylus porosus Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus The Australian saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) industry began commercially in the 1980s, producing skins for export and crocodile meat as a by-product. Industry research has thus far focused on strategies to improve production efficiency. In the current study, we utilised 16S rRNA sequencing to characterise the intestinal microbiome of Australian saltwater crocodiles. Samples were collected from 13 commercially farmed crocodiles from six sample sites along the length of the intestinal tract. The results indicate a similar microbiome composition to that found in the freshwater alligator, with the dominate phyla represented by Firmicutes, primarily Clostridia, and Fusobacteria, which appears to be distinct from mammalian, fish, and other reptile phyla which are generally dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The high abundance of â€˜pathogenicâ€™ bacteria, with no apparent consequence to the hostâ€™s health, is of great interest and warrants further additional investigation. This will enable expansion of the current understanding of host immune function and how it is modified by host and intestinal microbiome interactions."
"Feasibility Study of Scale-up Options for the Production of Nanocrystalline Cellulose from Australian Rice Hulls RMIT and SunRice have been in recent discussions regarding the opportunity to value-add to rice hulls. One potential high value product identified has been nano-crystalline cellulose (NCC). Nanocrystalline cellulose is a fully biodegradable and biocompatible nano-material; as such it has attracted great attention in biomedical related applications. It has also found increasing applications in the areas of personal care, chemicals, foods, paper, medical science, pharmaceuticals, engineering materials, oil drilling, and biodegradable packaging film as well. Therefore, it is expected that the demand of NCC will continue to increase significantly in the near future.
RMIT has recently completed some preliminary studies on the production of NCC from rice hulls and, now in collaboration with SunRice, wishes to further develop an experimental program to collect and collate information to develop a business case for a pilot plant."
"Sustainable criterion selection framework for green building materials – An optimisation based study of fly-ash Geopolymer concrete Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali Green materials are considered as one of the prominent elements in designing an environmentally sustainable construction project. Studies have highlighted cement replacement is a popular method of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and replacing virgin materials in concrete. These options incur cost implications through sophisticated designs and technologies. The importance of maintaining a balance between environmental and economic benefits of a green design is critical for the decision making stakeholders in a construction project. However, designers often lack the resources and tools to initiate informed decision making for the optimum selection of a green material. In order to systemize the optimising process, the current study suggests a multi-objective optimisation based decision making framework for optimising the cement replacement materials in concrete. The study aims to present a sustainable criterion optimisation framework that could well be adopted to assess the sustainability of green materials in concrete production. A case study using fly ash geopolymer concrete in Melbourne demonstrated a reduction of 3.63% to 41.57% and 23.80% to 30.25% can be achieved for GHG emissions and production cost respectively if the developed optimisation based framework is implemented. The scenario results highlighted around 3% to 8% GHG and cost increase if material is not available locally. A similar approach can be utilised to optimise the environmental and cost savings of other cement replacement materials. Further studies are encouraged on comparing environmental and cost savings of other cement replacement materials using the developed framework. The framework will be valuable for designers in making decisions on sustainable cement replacement materials."

"Understanding the Experiences of Vietnamese Women Leaders: Advancing an Existential Philosophical and Psychological Perspective Vietnam; Intimate Partner Violence; Sexual Health The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the value(s) of existential philosophy and psychology for understanding womenâ€™s lives in a cross-cultural context. It focuses on Vietnamese women and the formation of their self-identity in the process of becoming a leader. Theoretically, we draw on the existential philosophy of Martin Heideggerâ€™s fundamental ontology that emphasizes being, temporality and context (thrownness), Simone de Beauvoirâ€™s account of gender and other pertinent existentialists. To illustrate the value of an existential perspective, we offer an empirical example of a Vietnamese womanâ€™s life-story (who was chosen because she is a leader), interpreting her self-identity as it unfolds over the life span. This approach has the potential to capture an individualsâ€™ diverse and complex modes of being, how they take part in shaping their reality through their situatedness in the world. The value of existentialism lies in its view of self-identity as a process of becoming, as opposed to a fixed and stable entity, providing the means for theorizing the possibilities for female agency, which addresses one of the limitations of the existing research on womenâ€™s leadership in Vietnam. Our analysis of the participantâ€™s life-story offers a case illustration of her encounters with the conditions of existence, which serve as important events, milestones, and turning points that promote a critical reflection on the role that culture, choice, and meaning plays in her life and leadership."

"Uptake, depuration and sublethal effects of the neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, exposure in Sydney rock oysters Neonicotinoids; Imidacloprid; Nicotinic Receptors The broad utilisation of imidacloprid (IMI)in agriculture poses an increasing risk to aquatic organisms. However, the potential impacts on commercially important shellfish and chemical residues after exposure, are yet to be assessed. We investigated the levels of IMI in Sydney rock oyster (SRO)tissue during a three-day uptake and four-day depuration cycle using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. IMI was absorbed from the water, with significantly higher concentrations in the adductor muscles than the gills and digestive glands. Depuration was also fast with a significant drop in tissue concentrations after one day in clean water and complete elimination from all tissues except the digestive gland after four days. The distribution of IMI in SRO after direct exposure using mass spectrometry imaging demonstrated uptake and spatially resolved metabolism to hydroxyl-IMI in the digestive gland and IMI-olefin in the gills. We assessed the effects of IMI on filtration rate (FR), acetylcholinesterase (AChE)activity in the gills, and gene expression profiles in the digestive gland using transcriptomics. Exposure to 2 mg/L IMI reduced the FR of oysters on the first day, while exposure to 0.5 and 1 mg/L reduced FR on day four. IMI reduced the gill AChE activity and altered the digestive gland gene expression profile. This study indicates that commercially farmed SRO can uptake IMI from the water, but negative impacts were only detected at concentrations higher than currently detected in estuarine environments and the chemical residues can be effectively eliminated using simple depuration in clean water."
"Bamboo as an alternative bioenergy crop and powerful ally for land restoration in Indonesia Culms; Phyllostachys Edulis; Plantation The energy demand in Indonesia has increased significantly with its population growth, urbanization, and economic development. The growing concern of meeting energy demand while reducing dependency on fossil fuels has resulted in an increasing demand for renewable energy. As a country with a rich biomass base, bioenergy is now an important component of Indonesia's energy agenda. However, a crucial problem in bioenergy production is the selection of species that can provide a sustainable supply of feedstock without having an impact on food security and the environment. In this context, we discuss the characteristics and benefits of using bamboo, a perennial grass, as a potential species for bioenergy feedstock in Indonesia. We describe the fuel characteristics of bamboo along with the possibility to align its cultivation, production, and usage with environmental and developmental agendas which makes it a suitable bioenergy crop in the country. In addition, its ability to grow on degraded lands, fast growth, long root system, and easy maintenance prove it as a powerful ally for the restoration of degraded land. We recommend in-depth research on the social, ecological, and economic feasibility of using this species for bioenergy production."

"Honeycomb-like porous metallic glasses decorated by Cu nanoparticles formed by one-pot electrochemically galvanostatic etching Dealloying; Metallic Glasses; Copper Pitting corrosion is a common localized corrosion phenomenon, which can lead to cracks and mechanical failure in structural metal materials. On the contrary, pitting corrosion could be a beneficial tool for generating large-area porous structures, which holds a great premise in a number of functional services, such as catalysis, sensing, storage, imprint lithography, and membranes. Herein we presents an electrochemical approach for creating a large-area honeycomb-like porous structure in Zr-based metallic glasses. A pitting process followed by subsurface tunnel etching in NaCl solution elicits to characteristic micrometer scale channels and nanometer size amorphous sidewalls decorated by Cu nanoparticles on the metallic glass substrate. A root-shape growing mechanism of tunnels initiated from pits and penetrating into alloy matrix is postulated. In addition, the effect of alloy composition on the microstructure of honeycomb-like porous metallic glasses is also investigated in detail."
"Selection of appropriate dispatch strategies for effective planning and operation of a microgrid Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems The power system responsiveness may be improved by determining the ideal size of each component and performing a reliability analysis. This study evaluated the design and optimization of an islanded hybrid microgrid system with multiple dispatch algorithms. As the penetration of renewable power increases in microgrids, the importance and influence of efficient design and operation of islanded hybrid microgrids grow. The Kangaroo Island in South Australia served as the studyâ€™s test microgrid. The sizing of the Kangaroo Island hybrid microgrid system, which includes solar PV, wind, a diesel engine, and battery storage, was adjusted for four dispatch schemes. In this study, the following dispatch strategies were used: (i) load following, (ii) cycle charging, (iii) generator order, and (iv) combination dispatch. The CO2 emissions, net present cost (NPC), and energy cost of the islanded microgrid were all optimized (COE). The HOMER microgrid software platform was used to build all four dispatch algorithms, and DIgSILENT PowerFactory was used to analyze the power systemâ€™s responsiveness and dependability. The findings give a framework for estimating the generation mix and required resources for an islanded microgridâ€™s optimal functioning under various dispatch scenarios. According to the simulation results, load following is the optimum dispatch technique for an islanded hybrid microgrid that achieves the lowest cost of energy (COE) and net present cost (NPC)."
"Gender Disparity Impacts on Thymus Aging and LHRH Receptor Antagonist-Induced Thymic Reconstitution Following Chemotherapeutic Damage Epithelial Cells; Thymocytes; Central Tolerance One of the main consequences of thymus aging is the decrease in naÃ¯ve T cell output. This condition accelerates at the onset of puberty, and presents as a major clinical complication for cancer patients who require cytoablative therapy. Specifically, the extensive use of chemotherapeutics, such as cyclophosphamide, in such treatments damage thymic structure and eliminate the existing naÃ¯ve T cell repertoire. The resulting immunodeficiency can lead to increased incidence of opportunistic infections, tumor growth relapse and/or autoimmune diseases, particularly in older patients. Thus, strategies aimed at rejuvenating the aged thymus following chemotherapeutic damage are required. Previous studies have revealed that sex hormone deprivation in male mice is capable of regenerating the thymic microenvironment following chemotherapy treatment, however, further investigation is crucial to identify gender-based differences, and the molecular mechanisms involved during thymus regeneration. Through phenotypic analyzes, we identified gender-specific alterations in thymocytes and thymic epithelial cell (TEC) subsets from the onset of puberty. By middle-age, females presented with a higher number of thymocytes in comparison to males, yet a decrease in their Aire+ medullary TEC/thymocyte ratio was observed. This reduction could be associated with an increased risk of autoimmune disease in middle-aged women. Given the concurrent increase in female Aire+ cTEC/thymocyte ratio, we proposed that there may be an impediment in Aire+ mTEChi differentiation, and Aire+ cTEChi as its upstream precursor. The regenerative effects of LHRH receptor antagonist, degarelix, on TEC subsets was also less pronounced in middle-aged females compared to males, possibly due to slower progression of thymic involution in the former, which presented with greater TEChi proportions. Furthermore, following cyclophosphamide treatment, degarelix enhanced thymocyte and mature TEC subset recovery, with faster recovery kinetics observed in females. These events were found to involve both reactivation and proliferation of thymic epithelial progenitor cells. Taken together, the findings from this study portray a relationship between gender disparity and thymus aging, and highlight the potential benefits of LHRH receptor antagonist treatment for thymic regeneration. Further research is required, however, to determine how gender may impact on the mechanisms underpinning these events."

"Anonymous and Confidential Reporting Options for Sexual Assault: An Exploration of their Purpose, Use and Potential in Australia The proposed project seeks to investigate the purpose, use and potential of anonymous and confidential reporting options for survivors of sexual assault. The under-reporting of sexual assault has long been a significant issue for criminal justice policy and practice. According to the latest 2016 Personal Safety Survey (ABS 2017), 9 out of 10 (87%) of female survivors who had experienced sexual assault by a male did not report the most recent incident to police. A substantial body of feminist research has investigated the challenges associated with formally reporting sexual assault to criminal justice agencies that contributes to consistently low reporting rates both nationally and internationally (see Literature Review in the Supporting Materials). To address problems related to formally reporting sexual assault, policing jurisdictions internationally and domestically have begun developing alternative reporting options for sexual assault survivors."
"The making of a climate emergency response: Examining the attributes of climate emergency plans Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Climate emergency declarations are amongst the strongest statement from governments in the face of global warming. At least 1217 local governments have so far declared a climate emergency; however, on a national government level, only seven such declarations have been made, most of which were in 2019. The exponential rise of local governments declaring a climate emergency is significant, and developing an understanding of how these responses are operationalised is critical. Previous studies indicate that local government practitioners conceptualise climate change as a complex emergency but tend to suggest â€˜business as usualâ€™ responses, unfit to deal with this complexity. Since these governments around the world have declared climate emergencies, it is unknown if the newly released climate emergency plans still tend to suggest such â€˜business as usualâ€™ response approaches or if we are now seeing the making of a more complex response to the complex threat of climate change. In this paper, we review two local governments' climate emergency plans: Auckland (New Zealand) and the City of Darebin (Melbourne, Australia). Our research develops a conceptual understanding of climate emergency mode (10 critical key attributes are articulated) and we reveal through the review of our two cases that this understanding is embedded in policy documents to varying degrees but give little explicit attention to processes of prioritisation or economic mobilisation. This research contributes to an initial understanding of a climate emergency mode in governance systems and provides a way forward from business as normal to a complex emergency response for climate change."

"Live-cell systems in real-time biomonitoring of water pollution: Practical considerations and future perspectives Genetic Procedures; Photorhabdus Luminescens; Whole Cell Continuous monitoring and early warning of potential water contamination with toxic chemicals is of paramount importance for human health and sustainable food production. During the last few decades there have been noteworthy advances in technologies for the automated sensing of physicochemical parameters of water. These do not translate well into online monitoring of chemical pollutants since most of them are either incapable of real-time detection or unable to detect impacts on biological organisms. As a result, biological early warning systems have been proposed to supplement conventional water quality test strategies. Such systems can continuously evaluate physiological parameters of suitable aquatic species and alert the user to the presence of toxicants. In this regard, single cellular organisms, such as bacteria, cyanobacteria, micro-algae and vertebrate cell lines, offer promising avenues for development of water biosensors. Historically, only a handful of systems utilising single-cell organisms have been deployed as established online water biomonitoring tools. Recent advances in recombinant microorganisms, cell immobilisation techniques, live-cell microarrays and microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip technologies open new avenues to develop miniaturised systems capable of detecting a broad range of water contaminants. In experimental settings, they have been shown as sensitive and rapid biosensors with capabilities to detect traces of contaminants. In this work, we critically review the recent advances and practical prospects of biological early warning systems based on live-cell biosensors. We demonstrate historical deployment successes, technological innovations, as well as current challenges for the broader deployment of live-cell biosensors in the monitoring of water quality."
"Healthcare service, food security, and sustainable development: Main reasons to grow opium poppy in Myanmar Rohingya (People); Military Government; Junta This chapter aims to analyze discrimination and disadvantage of local farmers in the process of opium eradication in Myanmar based on their specific explanations. The author utilizes some data and information collected from official reports and statements of the Myanmar Opium Farmers' Forum (2013-2018). Some multiple sources from inside and outside Myanmar in terms of human rights of ethnic minorities' opium farmers are also added. The current findings point out that there are a number of concerns and disadvantages with local opium farmers to look for survival livelihood, food security, and sustainable development in ethnic minorities' communities in Myanmar, particularly at Shan and Kachin States. The chapter also calls for further researches with specific recommendations and effective solutions for local opium farmers in the next stages."
"Gender-Technology-Trust: Feminist Reflections on Mobile and Social Media Practices Mobile Phone; Mobile Communication; Ambience This special issue of Australian Feminist Studies aims to make an interdisciplinary contribution to ongoing feminist conversations around gender, technology and trustâ€“with a particular focus on mobile and social media debates, dialogues and empirical examples. We strategically conceptualise the contingent relationality of gender and technology and trust as a hyphenated assemblage of â€˜gender-technology-trustâ€™, and foreground the complex, ambiguous, and nuanced theoretical and empirical development and analysis of what it means to â€˜trustâ€™ in the age of ubiquitous mobile and social media. The five articles and one interview included in this special issue emerge from the global and Australian context (ranging across rural and urban settings), and brings together feminist scholars to critically engage with gender-technology-trust relations that characterise quotidian life."
"A critical review of advanced oxidation processes for emerging trace organic contaminant degradation: Mechanisms, factors, degradation products, and effluent toxicity PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs The persistent nature and low biodegradability of a large number of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) reduce effectiveness of their removal by conventional wastewater treatments. In this context, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as photolysis, photocatalysis, ozonation, Fenton process, anodic oxidation, sonolysis and wet air oxidation, have been studied extensively for the effective degradation of the wide range of TrOCs. All AOPs produce reactive oxygen species (HO2â—, O2â—âˆ’), especially hydroxyl radicals that unselectively attack contaminants and oxidise them. Factors affecting the degradation rates of TrOCs by different AOPs include the concentration and nature of the TrOCs, bulk wastewater characteristics, dose of chemicals or catalysts used, and other reaction parameters. This review critically analyses the overview of already established AOPs, the effect of the structure of TrOCs based on different functional groups such as electron donating groups (EDGs) and electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) on their degradation by each AOP. The overall degradation rates based on data collected from a comprehensive literature review show that ozonation achieves effective degradation for a broad range of TrOCs, but it can lead to the production of toxic degradation by-products. By comparison, photocatalysis shows moderate to high degradation rate for TrOCs. Photolysis and Fenton processes show TrOC-specific suitability. This review also demonstrates that optimum doses of chemicals/catalysts are required for each AOP. This is because excessive concentrations of catalysts or other chemicals (e.g., H2O2: iron dose in Fenton process) may result in low TrOC degradation. Degradation of individual TrOCs can result in a number of degradation by-product that varies in nature. Different AOP has different reaction mechanisms that also affect the number and nature of by-product formation during TrOC degradation."
"Did social protection assist with progress towards the millennium development goals? Aid; Official Development Assistance; International Cooperation In this chapter, the authors advance discussions on the relevance of social protection as discussed in the literature and proceed to examine if social protection has played a role in achieving the progress made towards the MDGs. They argue that despite anecdotal evidence promoting social protection as crucial in assisting the vulnerable and poor manage risk, raise human capital and improve their livelihoods, there is an absence of empirical evidence to substantiate these claims. Using data for 101 developing countries, the authors show that social protection coverage is positively associated with progress towards many of the MDGs."
"Productivity in construction industry Labour Productivity; Construction Industry; Crews Since the late 1990s, the construction industry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has lagged behind the rest of the world in actual levels of productivity and productivity growth. This is despite the KSA Geed for the construction industry and the expectation that, in the coming decades, the KSA construction industry will continue to develop and grow to achieve the targets of Saudi Vision 2030. This paper explores in depth the concept of productivity to gain insights through answering two questions contextualized within the KSA construction industry: 1) How do managers perceive productivity? and 2) How is productivity measured? Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 senior managers with 1027 experience in project management in the KSA construction industry. Qualitative analysis of interview results found that around 40% of interviewees had little or an incorrect understanding of the concept of productivity and its relevance to production processes. This poor understanding of productivity and its measures extends to the lack of clear specific procedures for regular measurement of productivity."
"Energy poverty, temperature and climate change Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort We examine the effect of temperature shocks on the proclivity to be in energy poverty and combine our estimates with simulated weather data to predict the effect of global warming on the incidence of energy poverty over the rest of the century. To do so, we match representative household panel data for Australia with weather data at a geographically localized level. We find that each additional â€˜cold dayâ€™ (average temperature below 15 Â°C) increases the incidence of energy poverty by 0.01%â€“0.03%, compared to if the day had been in the comfortable temperature range (20-24 Â°C). We find that global warming can be expected to result in modest decreases in the extent of energy poverty in the short-medium and long-run. Most studies have emphasized the economic and social costs of climate change. Our findings are important in pointing to a specific outcome for which climate change may be beneficial for a large country with a relatively mild climate."

"Crystal Facet Engineering of Single-Crystalline TiC Nanocubes for Improved Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Photocatalytic Activity; Facet; Titanium Dioxide Single-crystalline {100} faceted TiC is of great significance in theory to a large number of engineering applications owing to its extraordinary catalytic properties. However, the {111} planes are prevalent in conventional TiC powders given their favorable thermodynamic stability during the initial low stoichiometric growth stage. Herein, a disproportionationâ€“decomposition strategy is developed to directly produce Ti and C atoms to synthesize single-crystalline {100} faceted TiC powders. Outstanding electrochemical performance of TiC {100} crystal planes in terms of the hydrogen evolution reaction is evidenced by an overpotential of 392 mV at 10 mA cmâˆ’2, which is 52% lower than that of randomly faceted TiC counterparts (815 mV)."
"Non-simultaneous droplet impingement cooling of a solid heated surface Droplet; Hyaluronate Lyase; Impingement High generation of heat in the electronics industry presents a roadblock for further innovations in higher processing power due to complications associated with overheating. Commonly used air-based systems cannot cool high-performance electronics, mainly due to the relatively poor thermo-physical properties of air. Spray cooling is a technique capable of cooling or quenching objects at very high temperatures and heat fluxes. While there has been considerable research on single droplet impact to study the fundamentals of spray cooling, multiple droplet impingement offers more realistic realisations of the dynamics of spray phenomena. In this paper, we examined the fluid dynamics and heat transfer of multiple droplet impingement using high-speed imaging and fast heat flux measurements to capture droplet-droplet and droplet-surface interactions at constant droplet Weber number. We investigated an individual droplet and two non-simultaneous droplets of water at a constant horizontal droplet spacing and different time separations to analyse the heat transfer at different initial surface temperatures. Although not affected significantly by the surface temperature, the maximum diameter of the combined droplets decreased for increasing time separation due to the kinematic discontinuity from the interaction between droplets moving in opposite direction. For small time separation, the spreading droplet contact line of the first droplet collided with the moving contact line of the second droplet. The receding and the quasi-static contact lines of the first droplet was strongly and mildly impacted by the second spreading droplet diameter, respectively. However, all quasi-static droplet diameters increased for non-simultaneous droplet scenario, following by a small reduction in the droplet diameter when the surface temperature increased due to evaporation. Depending on the surface temperature and time separation between droplets, it was found that the peak heat transfer rates for non-simultaneous droplet impingement scenarios can be increased by 68% to 100% when compared to a single droplet case due to higher combined droplet diameter and fluid volume in contact with the heated solid surface. However, the overall droplet cooling efficiency was higher for the single droplet case, showing that the droplet-droplet interaction can decrease the potential cooling performance of droplets. The present study provides knowledge combining droplet-droplet interaction and heat transfer performance for future spray cooling system design and optimisation."

"A comparison of abundance and distribution model outputs using camera traps and sign surveys for feral pigs Swine; Feral; Crop Damage Species distribution models play a central role in informing wildlife management. For models to be useful, they must be based on data that best represent the presence or abundance of the species. Data used as inputs in the development of these models can be obtained through numerous methods, each subject to different biases and limitations but, to date, few studies have examined whether these biases result in different predictive spatial models, potentially influencing conservation decisions. In this study, we compare distribution model predictions of feral pig (Sus scrofa) relative abundance using the two most common monitoring methods: detections from camera traps and visual surveys of pig sign. These data were collected during the same period using standardised methods at survey sites generated using a random stratified sampling design. We found that although site-level observed sign data were only loosely correlated with observed camera detections (R2 = 0.32-0.45), predicted sign and camera counts from zero-inflated models were well correlated (R2 = 0.78-0.88). In this study we show one example in which fitting two different forms of abundance data using environmental covariates explains most of the variance between datasets. We conclude that, as long as outputs are produced through appropriate modelling techniques, these two common methods of obtaining abundance data may be used interchangeably to produce comparable distribution maps for decision-making purposes. However, for monitoring purposes, sign and camera trap data may not be used interchangeably at the site level."
"Working with men in the human services Child Sexual Abuse; Sexual Crime; Female Sex Offender Men are often invisible in the human services. As clients and as workers, men have largely been ignored in the efforts that have been made to combat sexism in social work and welfare practice. Working with Men in the Human Services argues that addressing gender injustice requires an understanding of men as well as of women. The authors analyse how menâ€™s position in society affects their relationships with women, and with each other. They also examine the influence of masculine culture on menâ€™s self-perception and behaviour. Key practice issues are highlighted with case studies from a variety of contexts. Working with Men in the Human Services marks the beginning of a new agenda for profeminist practice with men, and is essential reading for students and professionals in social work, welfare and counselling. Working with Men in the Human Services challenges all social workers to rethink their assumptions about men, masculinity and menâ€™s issues. It does not negate feminist scholarship and practice, but rather broadens and deepens an appreciation of gender issues. It deserves to be widely read, is a must for any social workerâ€™s library, and will have a profound influence on social work theory and practice in the coming years."

"Privacy-Preserving User Profile Matching in Social Networks Privacy Preserving Data Mining; Secure Multi-Party Computation; Data Mining In this paper, we consider a scenario where a user queries a user profile database, maintained by a social networking service provider, to identify users whose profiles match the profile specified by the querying user. A typical example of this application is online dating. Most recently, an online dating website, Ashley Madison, was hacked, which resulted in a disclosure of a large number of dating user profiles. This data breach has urged researchers to explore practical privacy protection for user profiles in a social network. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving solution for profile matching in social networks by using multiple servers. Our solution is built on homomorphic encryption and allows a user to find out matching users with the help of multiple servers without revealing to anyone the query and the queried user profiles in clear. Our solution achieves user profile privacy and user query privacy as long as at least one of the multiple servers is honest. Our experiments demonstrate that our solution is practical."
"Regional Supply Chains and Natural Disasters This research will examine the supply chain impacts of disaster events, natural and
environmental health disasters. Given their importance to many parts of regional
Australia, the project will focus on the agriculture and tourism sectors, two of the three
major regional export sectors. The outcomes of the research will provide insights into
the impact of major disruptions to production and markets, and thus policy guidance
for the mitigation of such events.
Four questions will provide the focus for the research and the development of the
analytical framework:
What are likely to be the prominent interconnections within regional production systems
for the agriculture and tourism sectors?
Are there ‘pressure points’ in the production systems?
Are these points within or outside of the region and the supply chain?
What are the impacts of and for regulation?
The project will result in a framework, providing the conceptual basis and overarching
connections and relationships that constitute the value chains."
"Scrutinizing the Application of Saline Endophyte to Enhance Salt Tolerance in Rice and Maize Plants Salt Tolerance; Sodium Proton Exchange Protein; Salinity The present study aimed to witness the plantâ€“microbe interaction associated with salt tolerance in crops. We isolated the endophytic microbe from the root zone of halophytic grass. Later, the salt tolerance of the endophyte was tested in the saline medium and was identified using nucleotide sequencing (GenBank under the accession numbers: SUB9030920 AH1_AHK_ITS1 MW570850: SUB9030920 AH1_AHK_ITS4 MW570851). Rice and maize seeds were coated with identified endophyte Aspergillus terreus and were sown in separate plastic pots. Later 21-day-old seedlings were subjected to three NaCl concentrations, including 50, 100, and 150 mM salt stress. Under saline conditions, A. terreus showed a substantial increase in growth, biomass, relative water content, oxidative balance, and photochemical efficiency of rice and maize plants. The data reflected that the stimulation of gibberellic acid (GA) in treated leaves may be the main reason for the upregulation of photosynthesis and the antioxidant defense cascade. The data also depict the downregulation of oxidative damage markers malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide in rice and maize plants. Conclusively, salt-tolerant endophytic fungus A. terreus explicitly displayed the positive plantâ€“microbe interaction by developing salt tolerance in rice and maize plants. Salt tolerance by endophytic fungus coincides with the enhanced GA concentration, which illustrated the stimulated physiological mechanism and gene in response to the extreme environmental crisis, resulting in improved crop productivity."
"Closed Loop Food Production and the ‘Greening’ of Corrections Facilities: Using Composted Kitchen Waste for Fresh Food Production Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste Food represents a large proportion of putrescible waste in landfill in Australia, with very little food waste processed to recover resources. This has environmental impacts in the form of greenhouse gas generation and other externalities. Prisons typically waste high levels of food compared to the general community and, with the exception of a few small-scale and isolated composting examples in Australian prisons, the majority of prison food waste is sent to landfill. Internationally, especially in the U.S.A., the so-called â€˜greening of correctionsâ€™ has gained pace over the past few decades with the movement espousing similar objectives to certain United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. The literature suggests that prisoner participation in sustainability measures, environmental stewardship programs, landscape gardening and or agricultural/horticultural production decreases the chance of recidivism and is likely to improve the chance of post-release employment in the sustainability industry. As part of the greening of corrections, there are a number of examples of large-scale food waste composting operations used as the basis for significant, and often lucrative, fresh food production in prisons. Various U.S.A. prisons have demonstrated substantial waste disposal savings and further savings on fertilizers and fresh produce as a result of food waste composting processes. The types of food waste composting technologies and techniques utilised in these U.S.A. prisons, the savings in waste disposal fees and fertilizer costs, and the consequent food production could have beneficial impacts if modified for Australian conditions."
"P2P Lending platforms in Malaysia: the awareness among young adults Crowdfunding; Lending; Fintech Background - Since 2016, the Securities Commission (SC) in Malaysia has given licenses to only eleven P2P lending platforms. Such lending platforms are expected to disrupt the lending services of traditional lenders in the coming years. However, being still in their infant stages, it is essential to know the extent to which such platforms are made known to potential investors out there. This study examines the extent to which young adults are aware of Malaysia's eleven P2P lending platforms. Methods - A sample of 65 undergraduate students majoring in finance and accounting was used for this pilot study. An online questionnaire was designed with three main parts: demographic, financial literacy, and P2P lending awareness. Results - Findings show that more than half of respondents in the sample are not aware of P2P lending platforms in Malaysia. Most of the respondents are financially literate to certain degrees. Those aware of their presence underestimated the potentially high level of their default rates and misunderstood that investor would be fully protected by such platforms when a loan default. Conclusions -The study's findings have shed light on the current awareness of P2P lending platforms among Malaysian young adults, potential investors of such platforms in the coming years."

"The toxicity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to three freshwater invertebrates with different life strategies: Hydra vulgaris, Daphnia carinata, and Paratya australiensis Nanocrystal; Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticle; Ecotoxicity The toxicity of manufactured nanoparticles varies greatly depending on the test species in consideration and estimates of toxicity may also be confounded by test media in which the organisms are cultured. For a more comprehensive toxicity evaluation, species at different trophic levels or with life strategies, tested in different media should be included. In this study, we examined the toxicity of tyrosine-coated silver nanonparticles (tyr-AgNP) to three Australian freshwater invertebrates: Hydra vulgaris, Daphnia carinata, and Paratya australiensis. Tyr-AgNPs were synthesized, characterized and their behavior was examined in different media used for acute toxicity tests. Additionally, the sensitivity of tested organisms to tyr-AgNPs was compared to ionic silver (Ag+). Based on the LC50 values of both tyr-AgNPs and Ag+ions at different time points, D. carinata was found to be the most sensitive species followed by P. australiensis and H. vulgaris. NP stability studies revealed that tyr-AgNPs were least stable in hydra medium followed by daphnid and shrimp media. This study demonstrates that significant differences in NP toxicity to aquatic organisms exist and the test media and the life strategy of the species play a key role in these differences. Therefore, it is recommended that a multispecies approach is used in predictive risk assessment of NPs and to ensure protection of native species from possible toxic effects from NPs released into aquatic systems. Also recommended is to carefully investigate the fate and behavior of NPs in different media in assessing NP toxicity and emphasize the need to use native species in developing relevant regulatory frameworks."

"Contesting coal and climate change using scale: emergent topologies in the Adani mine controversy Livelihoods; Acquisitions Law; Right to Compensation The Adani mine controversy is a significant new space of contestation in conflicts over coal mining and climate change in Australia. Proposed as one of the largest new coal mines in the world, the Adani (or â€œCarmichaelâ€) mine has become a flashpoint between two broad coalitionsâ€”the pro-mine coalition, consisting of governments, elements of the media, and mining interests, and the anti-mine coalition, consisting of community groups, environmental non-government organisations, activists, Indigenous communities, and farmers. Based on thematic analysis of news media articles and interviews with environmental actors in the Adani mine controversy, this article demonstrates how each coalition employs discursive scale frames and counter-scale frames to represent and contest the controversy. We find that the pro-mine coalition remains situated within a topographical spatiality, with a backwards oriented temporality, that obscures emergent topologies from their view. In contrast, while retaining capacity for operating within traditional scalar topographies, the anti-mine coalition is more adept at negotiating topologies that increasingly define our social worlds. It is oriented towards a deep future horizon in which the Adani mine controversy represents an opportunity to reshape existing social and political orders. The sorts of scalar tactics documented here are likely at work in other resource extraction controversies, highlighting the need to attend to how scale may be being used to obscure irrationalities and injustices in extraction projects, and the potential for counter-scale frames to help destabilise fossil fuel regimes."
"A Review of the Potential Impacts of Wind Turbine Noise in the Australian Context Wind Farms; Wind Power; Social Rejection This manuscript describes a range of technical deliberations undertaken by the authors during their work as members of the Australian Governmentâ€™s Independent Scientific Committee on Wind Turbines. Central to these deliberations was the requirement upon the committee to improve understanding and monitoring of the potential impacts of sound from wind turbines (including low frequency and infrasound) on health and the environment. The paper examines existing wind turbine sound limits, possible perceptual and physiological effects of wind turbine noise, aspects of the effects of wind turbine sound on sleep health and quality of life, low-frequency noise limits, the concept of annoyance including alternative causes of it and the potential for it to be affected by low-frequency noise, the influence of amplitude modulation and tonality, sound measurement and analysis and management strategies. In so doing it provides an objective basis for harmonisation across Australia of provisions for siting and monitoring of wind turbines, which currently vary from state to state, contributing to contention and potential inequities between Australians, depending on their place of residence."
"Art Centres Supporting Our Elders - 'old people, that's where our strength comes from' - results from a national survay of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled art centres Torres Strait; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Indigenous Population Introduction: There are approximately 90 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled art centres across Australia, the majority in geographically remote locations. This survey explored how these centres are supporting older people, including people living with dementia, if and how they are collaborating with aged care services and what challenges and opportunities they identify in these arrangements. Methods: An online survey was developed by a team of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal researchers, art centre staff and art centre consultants. The survey was distributed in 2018 to art centres across Australia via their four art centre peak bodies: Desart; the Association of Northern, Kimberley and Arnhem Aboriginal Artists; the Indigenous Art Centre Alliance â€“ Far North Queensland and Torres Strait Islands; and the Aboriginal Art Centre Hub â€“ Western Australia. The survey was also conducted face-toface with participants at art centre annual events; and on field trips to North Western and Central Australia, conducted as part of an overarching study. Results: There were 53 completed surveys, with the highest proportion of responses (43%) from art centre managers. The survey generated 330 qualitative responses to the 13 questions that provided this option. The results showed that art centres play a wide ranging and vital role in supporting the health and wellbeing of older artists, many of whom are considered Elders within their communities, and that this reaches far beyond the production of art. The results showed that art centres are a safe place providing older people with the purpose and means to generate income, to enact governance, and to share cultural knowledge through intergenerational connection. Additionally, the results indicate that art centres provide a significant amount of direct care for older people, and that relationships are fundamental to delivering this social, emotional, spiritual and physical care. Furthermore, they showed a great deal of collaboration between art centres and aged care services, although little of this is formally documented or resourced. Conclusion: The survey results demonstrate that art centres play a significant and previously unexplored role in supporting the wellbeing of older people and people living with dementia in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities across Australia. Respondents shared diverse examples of providing physical, social, emotional, spiritual and cultural care, assistance with navigating health and aged care systems, as well as examples of collaborations with aged care and health providers. The results demonstrate opportunities to recognise and resource this vital work. These findings are particularly important in the context of Australiaâ€™s recent Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, which found that systemic change is urgently required. Additionally, Indigenous scholars have called for a swell of system reform to address inequities in health and aged care systems. They advocate for a fundamental shift from biomedical and siloed models of care to integrated models that centralise culture, intergenerational connection and the cultural determinants of health. The results show that art centres could bring their expertise to this conversation"
"Moving from the millennium to the sustainable development goals: Lessons and recommendations Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations Introduction With the introduction of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), perhaps the most important questions on the minds of most policymakers is whether the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were successful and what factors may have influenced their achievement. Answering these questions is important for assessing the ongoing progress of the SDGs and identifying key policy areas to focus on. This important edited collection examines various dimensions of the MDGs and development goals more generally, from socioeconomic factors to institutional, financial and more. The authors provide lessons and recommendations for attaining the Sutainable Development Goals that will be relevant to academics, development policymakers and practitioners, as well as NGOs, development agencies and students."
"Wastewater recycling in Antarctica: Performance assessment of an advanced water treatment plant in removing trace organic chemicals Ethinylestradiol; Endocrine Disruptors; Wastewater Treatment The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) operates Australia's Davis Station in the Antarctic. In 2005, Davis Station's wastewater treatment plant failed and since then untreated, macerated effluent has been discharged to the ocean. The objectives of this study were to determine whether an advanced water treatment plant (AWTP) commissioned by the AAD and featuring a multi-barrier process involving ozonation, ceramic microfiltration, biologically activated carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, ultraviolet disinfection and chlorination was capable of producing potable water and a non-toxic brine concentrate that can be discharged with minimal environmental impact. The AWTP was tested using water from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Tasmania, Australia. We used spot water and passive sampling combined with two multi-residue chromatographic-mass spectrometric methods and a range of recombinant receptor-reporter gene bioassays to screen trace organic chemicals (TrOCs), toxicity and receptor activity in the Feed water, in the environmental discharge (reject water), and product water from the AWTP for six months during 2014â€“15, and then again for three months in 2016. Across the two surveys we unambiguously detected 109 different TrOCs in the feed water, 39 chemicals in the reject water, and 34 chemicals in the product water. Sample toxicity and receptor activity in the feed water samples was almost totally removed in both testing periods, confirming that the vast majority of the receptor active TrOCs were removed by the treatment process. All the NDMA entering the AWTP in the feed and/or produced in the plant (typically < 50 ng/L), was retained into the reject water with no NDMA observed in the product water. In conclusion, the AWTP was working to design, and releases of TrOCs at the concentrations observed in this study would be unlikely cause adverse effects on populations of aquatic organisms in the receiving environment or users of the potable product water."

"Mitigating spatial conflict of land use for sustainable wetlands landscape in Li-Xia-river region of central Jiangsu, China Ecosystem Health; China; Ecological Civilisation Li-Xia-river Wetlands make up the biggest freshwater marsh in East China. Over the last decades, social and economic developments have dramatically altered the natural wetlands landscape. Mitigating land use conflict is beneficial to protect wetlands, maintain ecosystem services, and coordinate local socioeconomic development. This study employed multi-source data and GIS-based approaches to construct a composite index model with the purpose of quantitatively evaluating the intensity of land use conflict in Li-Xia-river Wetlands from 1978 to 2018. The results showed that the percentage of the wetlandsâ€™ area declined from 20.3% to 15.6%, with an overall reduction rate of 23.2%. The mean index of land use conflict increased from 0.15 to 0.35, which suggests that the conflict intensity changed from â€œno conflictâ€ to â€œmild conflict.â€ The number of severe conflict units increased by about 25 times. A conspicuous spatial variation of land use conflict was observed across different periods, although taking land for agricultural activities was the overriding reason for wetlands reduction. However, in recent years, urban sprawl has posed the greatest threat to Li-Xia-river Wetlands. Coordinating land use conflict and formulating a practical strategy are the initial imperative steps to mitigate the threat to wetlands."
"Comparative Genome Analysis of Two Heterotrophic Nitrifying Pseudomonas putida Strains Isolated from Freshwater Shrimp Ponds in Soc Trang Province Bacteria; Denitrifying Bacterium; Nitrification Nitrogen compounds, especially ammonia, are widely produced in aquaculture systems during cultivation. Ammonia has been investigated as a model compound for use by heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria. Pseudomonas TT321 and Pseudomonas TT322, isolated from shrimp pond water in Soc Trang province, Vietnam, are identified by comparing them with 31 of the closest genomes sequences from the NCBI nucleotide database. The genome sizes of strains TT321 and TT322 were 5,566,241 bp and 5,563,644 bp, respectively. No plasmids were evident in these strains. Genome analysis revealed that TT321 and TT322 belonged to Pseudomonas putida and shared a common ancestor with 33 genomes. Analysis based on the comparison of genomes showed that three genes, carbamate kinase (arcC), glutamine synthetase (Glul), and aminomethyltransferase (amt), are involved in three metabolic pathways. These pathways are: (i) arginine and proline metabolism, (ii) alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and (iii) glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. These genes may play important roles in ammonia reduction and support bacterial growth via ammonia assimilation."
"The science and politics of climate risk assessment in Australia's Murray Darling Basin Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Climate change has many disruptive consequences, particularly in large river basins experiencing drying trends and declining water availability. With pressure for more adaptive policies, understanding how institutions governing water are adapting to climate risks has broad international relevance. This paper examines the challenges of climate risk assessments in Australia's Murray Darling Basin, an economically and culturally important basin where national legislation mandates a Basin Plan based on the best available science. However, despite repeated scientific warnings about a drying climate, the current Basin Plan does not reduce estimates of water resources available, and its climate risk management relies on a bricolage of policy mechanisms, which appear insufficient for the magnitude of predicted changes. This paper outlines the findings of original research exploring why this occurred. It draws on interviews with 30 senior public policy professionals and researchers with deep experience in climate and water policy. The interview data indicate that minimising political risks were the principal reasons for abandoning proposed reductions in entitlements and for relying on historical averages for estimating water availability. As the reform process evolved, decisions about water-planning techniques became increasingly politicised, and the adoption of explicit climate adaptation measures became problematic. As a result, the Basin Plan neither reflects the broad scientific consensus about climate change nor makes specific allowances for declining water availability. Climate risks are downplayed while concerns about levels of scientific uncertainties appear overstated. Importantly, lessons emerge from this examination that could contribute to the revisions of the Plan, scheduled for 2026. More generally, the research finds that proactive climate adaptation policies for large river basins require sustained and well-designed institutional reforms, particularly the adoption of legally prescribed procedures for utilising science - and accounting for its use - in controversial environmental reforms."
"The potential of marketing communications to protect social workers in times of crisis Persuasion; Storytelling; Messages Socially stigmatized service workers (SSWs) like probation officers, social workers, and even aged care workers are often subject to negative media scrutiny when a crisis occurs, leading to public outrage and subsequent high attrition rates. The primary focus of this study is to examine the potential for marketing communication to generate a state of empathic concern amongst the public towards SSWs because an empathic public is less likely to want to punish, despite media calls to do so. A case is presented for the use of marketing communication explained through the lens of narrative execution and the general theory of emotion. Using a content analysis of public service announcements from representative bodies of social workers, in the US, UK and Australia we find little evidence of strategic intent to use narrative format or elicit empathic concern. A call and direction for further research is made in light of this finding."
"A critical control point approach to the removal of chemicals of concern from water for reuse PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs The reuse of water in a range of potable and non-potable applications is an important factor in the augmentation of water supply and in improving water security and productivity worldwide. A key hindrance to the reuse of water is the cost of compliance testing and process validation associated with ensuring that pathogen and chemicals in the feedwater are removed to a level that ensures no acute or chronic health and/or environmental effects. The critical control point (CCP) approach is well established and widely adopted by water utilities to provide an operational and risk management framework for the removal of pathogens in the treatment system. The application of a CCP approach to barriers in a treatment system for the removal of chemicals is presented. The application exemplar is to a small community wastewater treatment system that aims to produce potable quality water from a secondary treated wastewater effluent, however, the concepts presented are generic. The example used seven treatment barriers, five of which were designed and operated as CCP barriers for pathogens. The work demonstrates a method and risk management framework by which three of the seven barriers could also include a CCP approach for the removal of chemicals. Analogous to a CCP approach for pathogens, the potential is to reduce the use of chemical analysis as a routine determinant of performance criteria. The operational deployment of a CCP approach for chemicals was augmented with the development of a decision tree encompassing the classification of chemicals and the total removal credits across the treatment train in terms of the mechanistic removal of chemicals for each barrier. Validation of the approach is shown for an activated sludge, ozone and reverse osmosis barrier."
"A 30 kDa polyethylene glycol-enfuvirtide complex enhances the exposure of enfuvirtide in lymphatic viral reservoirs in rats Enfuvirtide; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Fusion Inhibitor; Inhibitor HIV therapy with anti-retroviral drugs is limited by the poor exposure of viral reservoirs, such as lymphoid tissue, to these small molecule drugs. We therefore investigated the effect of PEGylation on the anti-retroviral activity and subcutaneous lymphatic pharmacokinetics of the peptide-based fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide in thoracic lymph duct cannulated rats. Both the peptide and the PEG were quantified in plasma and lymph via ELISA. Conjugation to a single 5 kDa linear PEG decreased anti-HIV activity three-fold compared to enfuvirtide. Whilst plasma and lymphatic exposure to peptide mass was moderately increased, the loss of anti-viral activity led to an overall decrease in exposure to enfuvirtide activity. A 20 kDa 4-arm branched PEG conjugated with an average of two enfuvirtide peptides decreased peptide activity by six-fold. Plasma and lymph exposure to enfuvirtide, however, increased significantly such that anti-viral activity was increased two- and six-fold respectively. The results suggest that a multi-enfuvirtide-PEG complex may optimally enhance the anti-retroviral activity of the peptide in plasma and lymph."
"Phytochemical Profiling and Biological Activity of the Australian Carnivorous Plant,Drosera magna Naphthoquinone; Juglone; Drosera Phytochemical profiling was undertaken on the crude extracts ofDrosera magnato determine the nature of the chemical constituents present.

"‘My desire to play was stronger than my fear of re-injury’: athlete perspectives of psychological readiness to return to soccer following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery Sport Injury; Wounds And Injuries; Athletes The aims of this qualitative study were to understand how athletes (a) defined psychological readiness and (b) knew when they were ready to return to soccer following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. Data were collected from a group of 21 (male and female) athletes who had undergone ACL reconstruction surgery and returned to playing soccer. An open-ended, in-depth online survey was created to gather data on athlete understandings of psychological readiness, their experiences of overcoming psychological barriers when returning to sport, and any emotions or complications associated with their return to sport. Two main themes were uncovered in this study: â€˜Having Confidenceâ€™ and â€˜Love of the Gameâ€™. This research offers a greater understanding of how psychological readiness is defined from the perspective of soccer players, (particularly those returning to lower levels of competition, such as local and regional amateur clubs), than has been found in previous research."
"Public transport availability and healthcare use for Australian adults aged 18–60 years, with and without disabilities Physical Disability; Health Services Accessibility; Panel Survey Introduction: Public transport (PT) availability may be more important for people with disabilities (PWD), as typically they have greater healthcare needs and mobility barriers compared with people without disabilities. This paper investigates how PT availability is associated with healthcare use for people aged 18â€“60 years, with and without disabilities in Australia. Method: We used unique Australian healthcare use administrative data linked to the 2016 Census, where individuals report whether they have a disability (severe or profound core activity limitation). These data were merged with detailed information on local area PT availability for Australia's 21 largest cities. We estimated regression models to examine the association between PT availability and different types of healthcare use, while controlling for individual characteristics and larger area attributes. Results: PT availability was positively associated with visits to general practitioners (GP), with a higher magnitude observed for people with disabilities (PWD). While people without disabilities had on average 0.1 more GP visits per year when PT availability was high compared with low, PWD on average visited their GP 0.5 more times per year if they lived in areas with high as opposed to low PT availability. Nervous system prescriptions (which includes antidepressants) were 0.27 per year fewer for PWD living in areas with high compared with low PT availability. Conversely, nervous system scripts were 0.06 higher for people without disability with high compared with low PT availability. Conclusion: We conclude that PT availability is likely to be a key factor of healthcare use. Increasing PT availability may help overcome some barriers to healthcare use for PWD. Our findings are also consistent with PT increasing access to preventive care, which may reduce the severity or better management of illnesses. PT can play an important role in improving health and decreasing health inequalities between those with and without disabilities."

"A proposal for recycling theworld's unused stockpiles of treated wastewater sludge (biosolids) in fired-clay bricks Clay Brick; Brick; Husk Ash Millions of tonnes of leftover biosolids are increasingly stockpiled every year around the globe. Biosolids are a product of the wastewater sludge treatment process. Stockpiles necessitate the use of large areas of increasingly valuable land. Biosolids have many beneficial uses and are currently utilised in agricultural and land rehabilitation applications. However, it is estimated that 30% of biosolids are unused and stockpiled. A second and seemingly unrelated environmental issue is the massive excavation of virgin soil for brick production. The annual production of 1500 billion bricks globally requires over 3.13 billion cubic metres of clay soil-equivalent to over 1000 soccer fields dug 440 m deep or to a depth greater than three times the height of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. This paper investigates and proposes a practical solution for the utilisation of the world's excess biosolids in fired-clay bricks. The physical, chemical and mechanical properties of fired-clay bricks incorporating 25%, 20%, 15% and 10% biosolids have been tested. Bricks were produced from three different biosolids samples collected at Melbourne's Eastern Treatment Plant (ETP 22) and the Western Treatment Plant (WTP 10 & WTP 17-29). Compressive strength testing indicated results ranging between 35.5 MPa and 12.04 MPa for the biosolids-amended bricks. Leachate analysis was conducted on the bricks before and after firing, and the results demonstrate that between 43 and 99% of the heavy metals tested were immobilised inside the fired bricks compared to the heavy metals tested in the raw mixture. All leachate concentrations were found to be insignificant for the biosolids-incorporated bricks tested in this study. Biosolids can have significantly different chemical characteristics depending on the origin of the wastewater and the treatment procedure. Suitable leachate analysis should be undertaken on biosolids and test bricks before large-scale production is approved. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images illustrate that biosolids-amended bricks have a higher porosity than the control bricks, which corresponds to the lower thermal conductivity values recorded for biosolids-amended bricks. In addition, brick firing energy demands are estimated to decrease by up to 48.6% for bricks incorporating 25% WTP 17-29 biosolids due to the higher organic content of the mixture containing biosolids. The emissions study and comparative Life Cycle Assessment results show that the incorporation of biosolids into bricks is a positive and sustainable alternative approach with respect to all environmental impacts arising from the stockpiling of biosolids and brick manufacturing. Based on the results found in this comprehensive study, this paper proposes the inclusion of a minimum of 15% biosolids content into 15% of brick production in order to completely recycle all the approximately 5 million tonnes of annual leftover biosolids production in Australia, New Zealand, the EU, the USA and Canada. This is a practical and sustainable proposal for recycling all the leftover biosolids worldwide. Utilisation of only 15% of biosolids in brick production would reduce the carbon footprint of brick manufacturing whilst satisfying all the environmental and engineering requirements for bricks."
"The Myth of the ‘Ideal Offender’: Challenging persistent human trafficking stereotypes through emerging Australian cases Human Trafficking; Sexual Exploitation; Prostitution Human trafficking and slavery offences are often constructed through prominent stereotypes of the ideal victim and the ideal offender. This article examines four common offender stereotypes created by representations of trafficking seen in the media, popular culture, government reports, and awareness campaigns, and challenges these stereotypes by comparing them with international and Australian research and statistics. This comparison demonstrates that the ideal trafficking offender is a myth that must be broken. To support this argument, the article explores two emerging Australian cases involving sexual exploitation and allegations of slavery and servitude that significantly depart from stereotypical representations of trafficking. This shows the limitations of offender stereotypes in explaining trafficking offences and demonstrates the need for greater emphasis on the role of coercive control in trafficking offences, the impact of trust and changing relationships, and the interrelationship of trafficking with domestic violence."

"Recycled aggregate from wet mix concrete Concrete Aggregates; Construction and Demolition Waste; Mechanical Properties Quarry aggregate reserves are depleting fast, particularly in some desert regions of the world. Worldwide Quarry aggregate production is about 4.5 billion tonnes, and Australia alone consumes about 130 million tonnes of aggregates annually. The process energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions from Quarry aggregate is around 7.4 to 8.0 kg CO2-e per tonne. Aggregate demand is also increasing with the expansion of construction. In contrast, the annual production of premix concrete in Australia is about 30 million cubic meters, and 3â€’5 % of concrete delivered to site remains unused and ends up in the landfills or crushing plants. Thus, manufacturing coarse aggregates using waste concrete is a sustainable approach in terms of environmental and economic aspects. This paper presents the mechanical performance results of concrete produce using a novel manufactured coarse aggregate recycled directly from premix concrete. A series of mixes of were produced using this manufactured coarse aggregate with the replacement by weight of quarry aggregate by 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. The mixes investigated were 100% Ordinary Portland cement and 25% replacement with Fly Ash for a 25 MPa and a 32 MPa concrete. All mixes were tested at 7 and 28 days for the compressive strength, and then compared with the concrete produced with quarry aggregate. Test results demonstrated that concrete produced with the recycled aggregate achieved a mean 28 day compressive strength equivalent to that of natural granite aggregate for the 25 MPa mix and slightly lower (1-3 MPa) for the 32 MPa mix. No effect on compressive strength was observed based on the level of replacement of recycled aggregate added."
"A World Without Bees: simulating important agricultural insect pollinators. Administered by Monash University Insects are essential to agriculture, but their populations are changing in poorly understood ways that are likely to
impact on human food supplies. This Project will construct evolutionary agent-based models of change in croppollinating
insects: honeybees, bumblebees, stingless bees, and flies. It will model how these population changes
affect production, predicting floral traits to breed into crop plants for ongoing pollination success - for economic
viability, and national and global food security. One major practical outcome will be a flexible ""artificial life""
plant/pollinator simulation of insect-specific visual perception, innate and learned foraging behaviour, important
physiological factors, and inter-species interactions."
"Sustainable food waste management model for Bangladesh Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste Excessive food waste (nearly 1.3 billion tons per annum) has exacerbated the world hunger crisis. This comprehensive review focuses on the food waste scenario, adverse effects, food waste management, existing waste management policies, and regulations in Bangladesh. Municipalities and urban centers generate 3.78 million tons of waste each year (15.96% of total food waste). This study utilized the national database to analyze food waste generation and projected growth by the year 2050. Yearly an estimated 17215.2 thousand acres of land and a significant amount of natural resources (water, energy) are being used to produce 23691.15 thousand tons of wasted food (45% of total food production). This study critically analyzed the waste management policy gap of Bangladesh and clearly identified each stage of the food loss production supply chain. The study assessed that yearly 481.6 MW energy could be generated from food waste. Focusing on effective policy and sustainability, a national food waste management model has been proposed for Bangladesh in compliance with sustainable development goals 12.3.1 global food loss. Food accumulates 16.7% to 20% of the world economy; therefore, any measures taken to reduce the food waste will be economically beneficial and environmentally sustainable."
"Macroscale superlubricity of Si-doped diamond-like carbon film enabled by graphene oxide as additives Diamond Like Carbon Films; Amorphous Carbon; Carbon Carbon-based materials including diamond-like carbon (DLC) and graphene have been demonstrated as extraordinary lubricating materials due to its specific structure and weakness of the interlayer interactions. In this work, the extreme coefficient of friction (COF = 0.002) was achieved on the silicon-doped hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H:Si) film by lubrication with graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets as additives in ethylene glycol. The tribochemical reactions occurred on the Si3N4 surface and a-C:H:Si film, leading to the formation of the silica colloid layer on both Si3N4 and a-C:H:Si surfaces. In the meantime, the physical adsorption of GO nanosheets on the friction surfaces makes the shear plane transfer from Si3N4/a-C:H:Si interface to GO/GO interface, which results in a further reduction of shear stress. The mechanism and modelling of a-C:H:Si and GO nanosheets synergistic lubrication effect was finally established to reveal the design principle of superlubricity at macroscale."
"Women Entrepreneurship and Sustainable Development: Bibliometric Analysis and Emerging Research Trends Migrant Workers; Self-Employment; Ethnic Business Women entrepreneurship has attracted the attention of academics and practitioners with a large body of research studies in recent years. Past literature reviews on women entrepreneurship have been criticized for their limited scope, lack of interdisciplinary perspective, and the need for more objective, technology-facilitated analytical methods. Our study provides insights into the development of women entrepreneurship research, including a new analysis through the lens of sustainable development and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bibliometric indicators and a systematic literature review approach are used to analyze literature published between 1991 and 2021 to better map the development of research and related opportunities for enhancing studies on women entrepreneurship. In addition to traditional bibliometric indicators such as publications, citations, etc., we used altmetrics, a new metric to assess the engagement and impact of publications based on social media presence. The Dimensions database has been used to assemble and arrange 3157 publications on women entrepreneurship, of which 843 publications are directly aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and 80 publications related to COVID-19. Our findings indicate that the top three SDG of interest to researchers are: SDG 8, decent work and economic growth; SDG 10, reducing inequalities; and SDG 5, gender equality. Within each SDG, we find concentrated studies on themes relating to the socio-political and small-medium enterprises, including family business management and gender biases, and their implications for sustainable development. Further, studies on the impact of COVID-19 reveal a significant bias towards womenâ€™s empowerment in ICT, digitization, and e-commerce while exposing the need for gender-moderated policies and governmental interventions. We offer suggestions for future studies on enabling and measuring the contributions of womenâ€™s entrepreneurship to sustainable development, including capital investments and the long-term impacts of the pandemic on women-led enterprises."

"Increasing Use of Human-Dominated Habitats as CO2 Emissions Warm and Acidify Oceans Biodiversity; Patellogastropoda; Intertidal Community Urban and artificial structures are increasingly added to the worldâ€™s coasts during a time in which changing climate is forecast to drive shifts in naturally occurring habitats. We ask whether the role of artificial structures as marine habitats will increase in importance relative to their natural counterparts, particularly as natural habitats are negatively affected by ocean warming and acidification. To evaluate this model, we contrasted use of natural (kelp forest and turfing algae) and artificial habitat (plastic pier-piling) by a nest-building amphipod (Cymadusa pemptos) under current and future climate conditions of CO2 and temperature. Under future conditions, amphipod populations in mesocosms increased, but this did not lead to greater proportional colonization of kelp and turf. Instead, colonization doubled in artificial habitats, and there was increasing production and occupation of nests on artificial habitats relative to natural habitats. In an age when human modification of natural substrata is increasingly cited as an agent of wildlife decline, understanding the future role of artificial habitats as replacement dwellings for natural habitats is critical. We pioneer an understanding of the future role of natural and artificial habitats, identifying the possibility that the role of urban structures as marine habitats may only increase."

"Urban Densification and 12-Year Changes in Cardiovascular Risk Markers Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Background: Population densities of many cities are increasing rapidly, with the potential for impacts on cardiovascular health. This longitudinal study examined the potential impact of population-density increases in urban areas (urban densification) on cardiovascular risk markers among Australian adults. Methods and Results: Data were from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study, in which adult participantsâ€™ cardiovascular risk markers were collected in 3 waves (in 1999â€“2000, 2004â€“2005, and 2011â€“2012). We included 2354 participants with a mean age of 51 years at baseline who did not change their residence during the study period. Outcomes were 12-year changes in waist circumference, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting and 2-hour postload plasma glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. The exposure was neighborhood population densification, defined as 12-year change in population density within a 1-km radius buffer around the participantâ€™s home. Multilevel linear growth models, adjusting for potential confounders, were used to examine the relationships. Each 1% annual increase in population density was related with smaller increases in waist circumference (b=âˆ’0.043 cm/y; 95% CI, âˆ’0.065 to âˆ’0.021 [P<0.001]), weight (b=âˆ’0.019 kg/y; 95% CI, âˆ’0.039 to 0.001 [P=0.07]), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (b=âˆ’0.035 mg/dL per year; 95% CI, âˆ’0.067 to âˆ’0.002 [P=0.04]), and greater increases in diastolic blood pressure (b=0.032 mm Hg/y; 95% CI, âˆ’0.004 to 0.069 [P=0.08]). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, at least in the context of Australia, urban densification may be protective against obesity risk but may have adverse effects on blood lipids and blood pressure. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms through which urban densification influences cardiovascular health."
"Does Corruption in Exporter and Importer Country Influence International Trade? Firm; Bribes; Anti-corruption Measures We investigate whether bilateral exports of goods flowing from Vietnam to its 46 top trading partners are affected by corruption over the period 2000â€“2014. We capture the effects of corruption of Vietnam and her trade partners, separately using the corruption perception index (CPI) developed by Transparency International. The CPI captures both bureaucratic and political corruption perceptions. Our key results are as follows. We find that corruption in Vietnam has discouraged its bilateral export flows. The negative effect of corruption is highly significant in the long-run. In driving Vietnamâ€™s exports, perceptions of corruption in Vietnam are found to be more potent than perceptions in importer countries. We find that the sign effects of corruption in Vietnam or trading partner countries (or importers) are not dependent on whether trading partners are developed or developing. However, we do find that corruption discourages developing countries more than developed countries from importing goods from Vietnam. We confirm the robustness of our results using the control of corruption (COC) measure of corruption extracted from the World Bank Database."
"Learning through sharing: Beyond the traditional North-South learning models for a circular built environment Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework There is a general assumption that knowledge sharing takes place in a North-South direction; with North Americans and Europeans providing pearls of wisdom to the global South. At a recent Sustainable Built Environment knowledge sharing workshop this assumption was challenged. The workshop brought together building and circular economy experts from governments, public and private sector, financing organisations and researchers. The aim of this workshop was to share experiences between experts from The Netherlands, actively engaged in promoting and applying circularity principles in the country and the region, and Sustainable Building and Construction (SBC) partners engaged in promoting sustainable building and construction practices, including circularity, internationally. Participants were from Asia, Africa, Latin America, Australia and the EU. The workshop was set up in an interactive, action research format. The key messages arising from the workshop supported that South-North learning was equally valuable as North-South learning, supporting knowledge sharing rather than knowledge transfer. There was a recognition of the imminent danger of global system collapse if current practices were not changed immediately. Urgency was recognised as being a key driver to move to a new paradigm shift both in the North and the global South. There was also a recognition that since the task is complex and there are multifaceted considerations, it is not helpful to wait to align all stakeholders to develop common solutions. Grass roots engagement and development need to be supported and nurtured in alignment with various stakeholders. Governments can support circular processes through a top-down policy platform. Traditional and cultural practices in the global South may provide not only ideas for engagement but also new ways of thinking in a quest for diversity of solutions to be applied to reach our sustainability goals."
"Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 354 Diseases and Injuries for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2017: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 National Burden; Territories; Disease Background: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) includes a comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. Methods: We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68 781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. Findings: Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3Â·9% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3Â·1-4Â·6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7Â·2% (6Â·0-8Â·4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421-723) to 853 million (642-1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7Â·9% (6Â·6-9Â·2) for males and 6Â·5% (5Â·4-7Â·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95% UI 2782-3252] per 100 000 in males vs 1400 [1279-1524] per 100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082-3583] vs 2336 [2154-2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943-3630] vs 5643 [5057-6302]). Interpretation: Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury."

"Building the Evidence for Family Violence Policy Reform: The Work of Specialist Women's Refuges in Victoria, Australia Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Help-Seeking While specialist women's refuges have been central to responses to family violence since the 1970s, their work is under-researched. Little is known outside the family violence sector about the support they provide and how it assists women and children. There have been some critiques of their work but there is limited knowledge of the constraints women's refuges face. Based on interviews and focus groups with 100 professional stakeholders and twenty-two service users, this article analyses the work of women's refuges in the Australian state of Victoria in an effort to inform policy reform. The research found that refuges' underpinning gendered analysis, focus on safety and support and advocacy to ensure women's human rights are met have much to offer further developments in responding to family violence. In doing so, the article contributes to critical debates about the operation of refuges and the need for specialist family violence services."

Triple Zero Kids Challenge GAME CONCEPTS
While three concepts are being presented, only a single game is intended to be fully developed within the context of this budget estimate and proposal. The final selection should be a balance of innovative technology, user engagement and measurable learning outcomes. The final choice to be determined at the conclusion of key stakeholderbplanning and/or workshops, with a functional specification being fully approved before development commences.

The following game concepts all draw upon user participation content, either as a volunteered individual or as multi-player within a group.
The presenter can either be the primary driver or allow the presentation to be more digitally automated. While the first two concepts could be facilitated without any technology requirements, being able to use technology as means of input and output, allows for a fun interactive learning environment and the capture of analytical data to measure reach and effectiveness.

As each school will have access to unique resources, all concepts will have recommendations for fallback options where technology in the school environment may be a challenge. However, it most cases it is assumed that a high percentage of schools will have at least access to a Smartboard and an internet connection. In some cases a mobile device with cellular access to the internet may be sufficient."

"Designing with nature-based solutions to mitigate flooding in mataniko river catchment, honiara Flood Damage; Flooding; Natural Hazards With increasing population and pressure on land resources in the wake of climate change in Oceanic Cities, working locally with ecosystems through nature-based solutions can be a practical approach towards resilient landscapes. Extreme weather conditions and rainfall events as inevitable consequences of the future change require landscape designers to stay abreast of technology in hydrology and hydraulic modelling. This paper illustrates experimental landscape interventions to redesign topographic configurations in Adobe Photoshop that offers unlimited opportunities for developing scenarios for flood mitigation. Through the coupling of GIS with a program that models the hydraulics of water flow, a method to familiarise designers with flood impacts using an iterative and scientifically informed design process is proposed. We conclude through the proposed workflow that the application of nature-based solutions was effective in reducing the water depth in flood events by 6.67 meters in vulnerable areas of the catchment occupied by informal settlements."
"A basis for defining archetypes for non-engineered low-rise unreinforced brick masonry residential buildings of Pakistan Masonry; Clay Brick; Brick The salient characteristics of low-rise unreinforced brick masonry residential buildings of Northern Pakistan are presented, aiming to provide a basis for defining archetypes suitable for seismic vulnerability assessment in this area. Firstly, an overview of the typical geometrical characteristics, the mechanical properties of the commonly used materials, the main structural features, and observed damage patterns of such buildings is given. Available test data on a set of wallets and a single room consistent with the configuration and construction practices in Northern Pakistan are selected. The wall strength reference values and the effect of construction issues that influence the boundary conditions, such as the wall-to-wall and wall-to-slab connections, are studied, too. The consistency between the failure mechanisms activated by the experimental tests and those predicted by analytical strength criteria available in the literature is shown; this is used as a tool to define the most plausible values of mechanical parameters to be adopted as a reference in seismic safety building evaluation. These results constitute the preliminary but necessary step to address structural models for building and class vulnerability assessment of, arguably, one of the most dominant and vulnerable building types in Pakistan, and by extension, of a large part of South Asia."
"The Southern Bluefin Tuna Mucosal Microbiome Is Influenced by Husbandry Method, Net Pen Location, and Anti-parasite Treatment Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus Aquaculture is the fastest growing primary industry worldwide. Marine finfish culture in open ocean net pens, or pontoons, is one of the largest growth areas and is currently the only way to rear high value fish such as bluefin tuna. Ranching involves catching wild juveniles, stocking in floating net pens and fattening for 4 to 8 months. Tuna experience several parasite-induced disease challenges in culture that can be mitigated by application of praziquantel (PZQ) as a therapeutic. In this study, we characterized the microbiome of ranched southern Bluefin Tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, across four anatomic sites (gill, skin, digesta, and anterior kidney) and evaluated environmental and pathological factors that influence microbiome composition, including the impact of PZQ treatment on microbiome stability. Southern bluefin tuna gill, skin, and digesta microbiome communities are unique and potentially influenced by husbandry practices, location of pontoon growout pens, and treatment with the antiparasitic PZQ. There was no significant relationship between the fish mucosal microbiome and incidence or abundance of adult blood fluke in the heart or fluke egg density in the gill. An enhanced understanding of microbiome diversity and function in high-value farmed fish species such as bluefin tuna is needed to optimize fish health and improve aquaculture yield. Comparison of the bluefin tuna microbiome to other fish species, including Seriola lalandi (yellowtail kingfish), a common farmed species from Australia, and Scomber japonicus (Pacific mackerel), a wild caught Scombrid relative of tuna, showed the two Scombrids had more similar microbial communities compared to other families. The finding that mucosal microbial communities are more similar in phylogenetically related fish species exposes an opportunity to develop mackerel as a model for tuna microbiome and parasite research."
"Paid work in cash-for-care: Australia in comparative perspective The provision of social care to vulnerable people is undergoing major change with the introduction of individualised or cash-for-care funding. Under these arrangements money for care is allocated directly to people to purchase their own services. Cash-for-care changes the organisation of paid care work in ways that pose significant risks for workers and for the development of sustainable social care workforces. This project will examine outcomes for care workers under cash-for-care. This will be achieved through a case study of Australia's National Disability Insurance Scheme in a comparative context. The project aims to identify regulatory strategies for creating quality work for paid care workers in flexible, high-quality care systems."

"Enduring silence: racialized news values, white supremacy and a national apology for child sexual abuse Peace; Sexual Abuse; Rape This article examines news coverage of Australia's 2018 National Apology to Victims of Institutional Child Sexual Abuse to reveal how conventional news values and practices produce racialised hierarchies of media attention that routinely position whiteness at the pinnacle. Via content analysis of media coverage, informed by critical discourse analysis, we focus on whether news reporting of the Apology reflected the Royal Commission's stated commitment, care and attention to ensuring First Nations people, who were over-represented among victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, were afforded voice and agency in media. The coverage was remarkable for its failure to connect the 2018 Apology to the 2008 Apology to the Stolen Generations, or to ongoing concerns regarding high rates of Indigenous child removal and over-incarceration. Overall, we argue that news values and routines work to structure media representation through logics of white supremacy and relegating colonial violence to the past."

"Overcoming the social stigma of consuming food waste by dining at the Open Table Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems Stigma is often encountered by recipients who receive food donations from charities, while the consumption of wasted food, also traditionally considered to be a stigmatized practice, has recently become part of a popular food rescue movement that seeks to reduce environmental impacts. These two stigmasâ€”charitable donation and the consumption of wasteâ€”are brought together at the Open Table, a community group in Melbourne, Australia, that serves community meals cooked from surplus food. This paper examines how Open Table de-stigmatizes food donations through food waste discourse to enable greater social inclusion. I draw on the experiences of donors, cooks, volunteers and eaters gathered from diverse Open Table sites. Taking a â€˜follow-the-thingâ€™ approach, I analyze how food â€˜wasteâ€™ becomes re-valued by embracing goals of environmental justice enacted through local processes of care and conviviality. Relying on networks of volunteers and not-for-profit agencies, Open Table provides a simple, effective and adaptable model for possible replication for overcoming drawbacks of traditional charity practices. Critically though, as hunger in society continues to grow, this approach is increasingly threatened by the need to â€˜single outâ€™ disadvantaged recipients to justify continued supply. This paper contributes to food poverty, waste, and Alternative Food Network literature in two important ways: first, by analyzing the outcomes of community food redistribution approaches with regards to stigma and inclusion; and secondly, by arguing that such holistic approaches need to be acknowledged, valued and supported to shift current discourses and practice."
"Sustainable closed-loop supply chain with energy efficiency: Lagrangian relaxation, reformulations and heuristics Closed-Loop Supply Chain; Remanufacturing; Reverse Logistics Research on the development of sustainable supply chain models is highly active nowadays. Merging the concept of supply chain management with sustainable development goals, leads to simultaneous consideration of all economic, environmental and social factors. This paper addresses the design of a sustainable closed-loop supply chain including suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers, customer zones, and disposal centers considering the consumption of energy. In addition, the distribution centers play the roles of warehouse and collection centers. The problem involves three choices of remanufacturing, recycling, and disposing the returned items. The objectives are including the total profit, energy consumption and the number of created job opportunities. As far as we know, these objectives are rarely considered in a sustainable closed-loop supply chain model. The proposed model also responds to the customer demand and also addresses the real-life constraints for location, allocation and inventory decisions in a closed-loop supply chain framework. Another novelty of this research is to develop a set of efficient Lagrangian relaxation reformulations and fast heuristics for solving a real-world numerical example. The results have revealed that the obtained solution is feasible and the developed solution algorithm is highly efficient for solving supply chain models. Finally, a comprehensive discussion is provided to highlight our findings and managerial insights from our results."

"Designing online communication mix for machinery manufacturers Product-service Systems; Service Economy; Value Co-Creation Recent global challenges and the development of digital technologies have caused companies to update their business models to incorporate the variety of existing online communication tools. This enables companies to design their communication with customers and other stakeholders in the most effective way based on the company's business goals. This study provides an approach for planning and assessing online communication mix for machinery manufacturers. The authors conducted a series of expert interviews and used the analytic hierarchy process as well as the method of parametric identification to determine the optimal set of elements for online communication in the market of machinery manufacturing. Based on the research findings, the authors developed and tested the model for planning online communication activities and assessing their effectiveness. The research results detect hidden relationships between the individual elements of online communication activities and the impact of those elements on each other. This approach makes it possible to evaluate online communication in terms of achieving companies' business goals, rather than evaluating individual indicators of separate communication elements. communication activities and the impact of those elements on each other. This approach makes it possible to evaluate online communication in terms of achieving companies' business goals, rather than evaluating individual indicators of separate communication elements."
"Carbon, water and energy fluxes in agricultural systems of Australia and New Zealand Eddy Covariance; Net Ecosystem Exchange; Ecosystem A comprehensive understanding of the effects of agricultural management on climateâ€“crop interactions has yet to emerge. Using a novel waveletâ€“statistics conjunction approach, we analysed the synchronisation amongst fluxes (net ecosystem exchange NEE, evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux) and seven environmental factors (e.g., air temperature, soil water content) on 19 farm sites across Australia and New Zealand. Irrigation and fertilisation practices improved positive coupling between net ecosystem productivity (NEP = âˆ’NEE) and evapotranspiration, as hypothesised. Highly intense management tended to protect against heat stress, especially for irrigated crops in dry climates. By contrast, stress avoidance in the vegetation of tropical and hot desert climates was identified by reverse coupling between NEP and sensible heat flux (i.e., increases in NEP were synchronised with decreases in sensible heat flux). Some environmental factors were found to be under management control, whereas others were fixed as constraints at a given location. Irrigated crops in dry climates (e.g., maize, almonds) showed high predictability of fluxes given only knowledge of fluctuations in climate (R2 > 0.78), and fluxes were nearly as predictable across strongly energy- or water-limited environments (0.60 < R2 < 0.89). However, wavelet regression of environmental conditions on fluxes showed much smaller predictability in response to precipitation pulses (0.15 < R2 < 0.55), where mowing or grazing affected crop phenology (0.28 < R2 < 0.59), and where water and energy limitations were balanced (0.7 < net radiation âˆ• precipitation < 1.3; 0.27 < R2 < 0.36). By incorporating a temporal component to regression, waveletâ€“statistics conjunction provides an important step forward for understanding direct ecosystem responses to environmental change, for modelling that understanding, and for quantifying nonstationary, nonlinear processes such as precipitation pulses, which have previously defied quantitative analysis."
"The environmental effect of trade liberalization: Evidence from China's manufacturing firms Misallocation; China; Firm Heterogeneity While prior literature on trade liberalisation and the environment has mostly focused on the macroeconomic ramifications, this study explores at the firm level whether and how changes of trade barriers brought about by China's accession to the WTO may impact on its manufacturing firmsâ€™ environmental performance. Adopting a difference-in-differences (DID) methodology, we document the effects of tariff reductions on improving firm-level SO2 emission intensity, and the key corporate strategic decisions responsible for delivering the observed results, with robustness tests covering other major pollutants. In response to trade liberalisation, firms are found to increase labour resources for environmental protection and to improve their production processes to reduce emission intensity. This study contributes to the literature by investigating at the level of the operating firm how output and input tariff reductions may impact on environmental performance and uncovering for the first time the specific actions responsible for the results."
"Facade fire failures in buildings: A robust nanocomposite solution The Grenfell tower fire in 2017 resulted in at least 80 fatalities, many injuries and demonstrated how vulnerable modern facades are to fires. This project aims to develop an innovative fire resistant composite facade system which is also strong, lightweight, thermally efficient, environmentally friendly and cost-effective. The project expects to develop new knowledge in areas of fire safety and advanced manufacturing of a nanocomposite facade with advanced computational fluid dynamics simulations to control the external flame spread, through a novel holistic approach. The outcomes will provide unprecedented insight into the mechanism of external fire spread and development of the facade system which is safe, resilient and saves lives."
"High-rise plastic: Socio-material entanglements in apartments Community Participation; Green Product; Environmental Attitudes Plastic is a persistent problem in westernised cities. Yet it is also a key mediator, affording and assisting the everyday. In small apartments, it supports daily life by assisting with waste management, storage, and provisioning of affordable ornaments and furniture. Plastic, in this context, is a mundane and utilitarian substrate to apartment life, as well as being a problematic potential pollutant. Recognising the diverse contributions to research on high-density living, this paper draws on vertical urbanism and relational ideas of home. It explores the socio-material entanglements of plastic in apartments through household interviews across Melbourne, London, Barcelona, and Perth. The research reveals ways in which plastic mediates the material inequalities of high-rise living, typified by entanglements of space constraint, transience, and waste management. The contribution is twofold. Theoretically, our work suggests a direction for socio-materialities research in reframing ideas of home as a static, physical site, to one that is more contingent materially and spatially. As various households adapt and make do, their refuges in the sky are being reconfigured physically and symbolically by and through plastic. Relational approaches can help to reveal the mundane but critical entanglements of plastic and everyday life in apartments. Second, empirically, we show that mundane infrastructures matter; they shape the spaces and places of plastic and apartment inequalities. Thus, policy interventions that target household behaviours can only have a marginal impact on plastic consumption where uneven infrastructures remain. Moreover, they may direct attention away from where change might be more promising, such as wider social rules and meanings around plastic, and the materialities of building design/management for waste infrastructures both inside and outside the apartment."
"Integration of a UAV-LIDAR System for Remote Sensing of CO concentrations in Smart Agriculture Stripe Rust; Plant Leaves; Puccinia Striiformis Precision agriculture is reliant on making timely, effective measurements to optimize workflow and crop yield. Manual inspection techniques are time consuming and do not support a frequent and autonomous monitoring of the field. This paper examines an innovative application of using a bistatic LIDAR sensor integrated into a UAV to monitor in-field CO concentrations. Measuring variations in atmospheric CO concentrations in agriculture can be used to detect plant health through correlation of photosynthesis efficiency and used to determine soil quality. LIDAR systems can maintain highly accurate measurements, particularly of small changes in CO concentrations, from substantial distances, making it ideal for remote UAV monitoring. Integration of such system into the UAV requires resolving mechanical, electrical, communication computing and control aspects, which are addressed in this paper through a feasibility study of the ground station tracking the system to steer the gimbal, on which the sensor is mounted. There is substantial interest in determining the appropriate UAV platform and consequently the hardware and software architecture and integration into the UAS."
"Effective dispatch strategies assortment according to the effect of the operation for an islanded hybrid microgrid Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems The optimized design of a freestanding hybrid microgrid for various distinct dispatch controls is assessed in this paper, which considers the optimal sizes of individual components, system response, and reliability analysis. The effective design and management of stand-alone islanded hybrid smartgrids are getting increasingly importance and influences as the prevalence of renewable energy in microgrids grows. Melville Island, off the coast of eastern Queensland, Australia, is taken as the test microgrid in this study. For the optimal sizing and techno-economic assessment of the intended hybrid microgrid system consist of of solar diesel generator, PV, battery storage, and wind turbine, four dispatch approaches have been unitized: load following, generator order, combined dispatch, and cycle charging strategy. The proposed off-grid microgrid's CO2 emissions, total net present cost (NPC), and the Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) have all been optimized. In HOMER software, all the possible dispatch algorithms were analyzed, and the power system responses and reliability study were carried out using DIgSILENT PowerFactory. The findings of the study are useful for determining the optimum hybrid combination and available resources for the best performance of an off-grid microgrid employing various dispatch mechanisms. Following the simulation data, load-following is the best dispatch mechanism for stand-alone microgrid architecture since it has the lowest LCOE and NPC."
"Are you puffing your Children's future away? Energy poverty and childhood exposure to passive smoking Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort We examine whether having a parent who smoked during one's childhood or adolescence increases the probability of being in energy poverty in adulthood. We find that people who had a parent who smoked when they were young are 0.8â€“1.4 percentage points more likely to be in energy poverty later in life. Various checks suggest that this relationship can be regarded as being plausibly causal. We identify health, human capital, labour market outcomes and non-cognitive traits as channels through which early life exposure to passive smoking increases the likelihood of being in energy poverty. Our results have important implications for early life interventions to address the deficits caused by exposure to passive smoking."
"Dependence and spillover among oil market, China's stock market and exchange rate: new evidence from the Vine-Copula-CoVaR and VAR-BEKK-GARCH frameworks Oil Price Shocks; Oil Markets; Petroleum We first employ the method of multivariate GARCH models and Vine-Copula-CoVaR to analyse relationships between dependence, systematic risk spillover, and volatility spillover between the USD/CNY exchange rate and the returns on WTI crude oil futures and the Chinese stock market since China's 2005 foreign exchange reform. We utilise daily data from 2005 to 2020. We find a more complex dependence of the USD/CNY exchange rate on stock markets and WTI crude oil prices. All have negative risk spillovers among paired markets, with WTI having the most substantial risk spillover. However, the strength of the systematic risk spillover varies across markets. Based on the results of the VAR(1)-BEKK-GARCH (1,1) and Wald tests confirm that there is a substantial mean spillover from the Chinese stock market and the USD/CNY exchange rate to the WTI crude oil price, whereas there is a more significant spillover from the WTI crude oil price to Chinese stock market volatility. The empirical findings extend the systematic understanding of the international crude oil price shocks to the dependence and transmission mechanism between the Chinese stock market and the USD/CNY exchange rate (USD/CNY). Our findings can help investors and policymakers to manage risk better and develop more sensible market rules."
"Involuntary excess reserve and bankers’ remuneration: evidence from Chinese banks Executive Compensation; Firm; Chief Executive Officer This article analyses the effects of involuntary excess reserves (IER) on bankersâ€™ remuneration and the penalty associated with bank risk-taking if discovered. The study finds that IER help conceal tail risks, improves bankersâ€™ performance and remuneration. However, the risks once discovered result in heavy penalties on bankersâ€™ remuneration. The study extends the agency theory to the context where banks hold large IER."
"Design, construction, and operation of the first industrial salinity-gradient solar pond in Europe: An efficiency analysis perspective Solar Ponds; Salinity; Exergy A 500 m2 industrial salinity-gradient solar pond (SGSP) was constructed in a mineral processing plant (Solvay Minerales) in Granada (Spain). This renewable energy technology was designed to supply a low-temperature heat (up to 60 Â°C) to achieve the temperature requirements of the flotation mineral purification stage. The low-temperature source was integrated to partially replace the fuel oil boiler used to heat the water used in the flotation stage. Theoretical calculations based on solar radiation indicated that the use of the SGSP would reduce the annual fuel consumption by more than 50%, thus providing a significant improvement at both economic and environmental levels. Two months after the SGSP was established, in August 2014, the temperature in the storage zone of the SGSP reached approximately 90 Â°C. The overall performance was evaluated in two periods (2014 and 2015) in terms of the retrofitting of mining facility with a solar pond and a new method to assess the thermal efficiency of the solar pond in a long-term perspective has been proposed. The overall efficiencies obtained after the first and second operation periods were 10 and 12%, respectively, with maximum values of 28 and 24% obtained during the first operation months. Regarding the economic savings, the fuel oil cost of the flotation unit was reduced by a higher percentage than the fuel oil consumption, due to the decreasing tendency of fuel oil prices during 2014 and 2015. Reductions of 52 and 68% were obtained in the first and second periods of operation, respectively, when compared to 2013. In addition, not only does the SGSP have considerably reduced operating costs but also the environmental costs are clearly reduced when considering the reduction of CO2 emissions."
"It takes a family to lighten the load! The impact of family-to-business support on the stress and creativity of women micro-entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka Psychological Capital; Work Engagement; Personnel Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether family-to-business support acts as a job resource that attenuates the negative effects of work demands on the stress and creativity of women micro-entrepreneurs in the informal sector in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 359 women micro-entrepreneurs and their respective case officers in local government were used to test the hypothesized relationship between work demands and their creativity through the mediating mechanism of stress and the moderating effect of family-to-business support on the said relationship. Findings: Work demands reduced creativity through heightening the levels of stress faced by women micro-entrepreneurs. However, family-to-business support reduced the negative influence of work demands on creativity through stress. Practical implications: Women micro-entrepreneurs should build strong family ties to obtain support from family members. In addition, government training programs that target women micro-entrepreneurs should be extended to include their immediate family members. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature by examining whether family-to-business support buffers the negative effects of work demands for women micro-entrepreneurs in the informal sector. In doing so it makes a theoretical contribution by testing the key tenets of the JD-R model in entrepreneurial settings."
"Impact of microalgae species and solution salinity on algal treatment of wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Six common microalgal species, including freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus abundans, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Coelastrum microporum, and marine microalgae Nannochloropsis salina and Dunaliella tertiolecta, were tested in batch treatment to identify the most promising species for remediating a municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC). Selected species were then studied at different ROC salinity levels (5, 10, and 15 g TDS/L) in semi-continuous treatment to evaluate their potential for nutrient remediation, and biogas production through anaerobic digestion. S. abundans, C. vulgaris, and N. salina showed higher potential for growth and nutrient remediation under salinity stress. Further tests revealed that N. salina adapted well to ROC conditions, and S. abundans could grow better and had higher tolerance to the elevated salinity than C. vulgaris. S. abundans and N. salina performed better for removing nutrients and organic matter (11.5â€“18 mg/L/d TN, 7.1â€“8.2 mg/L/d TP, and 8.6â€“12.4 mg/L/d DOC). Increasing salinity led to growth inhibition and N uptake reduction for freshwater species but had no significant effect on TP removal. Biochemical methane potential tests showed the algal biomass produced a significant amount of methane (e.g., up to 422 mL CH4/g VS for N. salina), suggesting the algae generated from the ROC treatment could produce significant amounts of energy through anaerobic digestion without the need for pretreatment. This study showed the environmental and economic potential of the algal system for future applications."
"Beyond green facades: integrating ecology and architecture This project aims to develop a novel architectural paradigm that embeds ecological science, working with nature to design cities that are more resilient to environmental upheavals. Methods aim to overcome substantial theoretical and technical challenges to embedding quantitative ecology into architectural design processes, including the development of new approaches for measuring and evaluating biodiversity benefits of alternative urban designs, from the building to landscape scale. Expected outcomes include enhanced capacity for the built form to address biodiversity considerations through nature-based solutions. The case study designs developed in this project should represent a template for more habitable, liveable, sustainable cities."

"The influence of extruded flour on water content and retrogradation process in muffins during storage: NMR relaxation study Frozen Dough; Dough; Glutens A comparative study of the moisture content, mobility of water protons and retrogradation process in muffin samples with the addition of extruded (ME) flour (10%) during storage (14 days) was carried out and compared to control samples without the addition (MO). A significant increase in water content during swelling of the extruded flour was found. The proton magnetic relaxation signal for both ME and MO showed a two-component character for the fast-decay region (free induction decay, FID experiment) and a three-component character for the slow-decay (CPMG experiment) one. The relaxation times T2 characterizing the protons of both water and non-aqueous fraction decreased during the experiment except for the protons of the fat fraction. The values of relaxation times T2 for ME exceeded the values for MO, which reflects the increased water content in ME. The amplitude of the signal of water protons (two components of CPMG) decreased for ME more slowly (by about 3â€“5 days), which can serve as a characterization the shelf life of the muffins. Estimation of the retrogradation rate according to the Avrami model showed a lower value of the rate for ME compared to MO, which may reflect the increased moisture content in ME."
"Microwave hydrothermal carbonization of rice straw: Optimization of process parameters and upgrading of chemical, fuel, structural and thermal properties Hydrothermal Carbonization; Hydrochars; Carbon The process parameters of microwave-induced hydrothermal carbonization (MIHTC) play an important role on the hydrothermal chars (hydrochar) yield. The effect of reaction temperature, reaction time, particle size and biomass to water ratio was optimized for hydrochar yield by modeling using the central composite design (CCD). Further, the rice straw and hydrochar at optimum conditions have been characterized for energy, chemical, structural and thermal properties. The optimum condition for hydrochar synthesis was found to be at a 180 Â°C reaction temperature, a 20 min reaction time, a 1:15 weight per volume (w/v) biomass to water ratio and a 3 mm particle size, yielding 57.9% of hydrochar. The higher heating value (HHV), carbon content and fixed carbon values increased from 12.3 MJ/kg, 37.19% and 14.37% for rice straw to 17.6 MJ/kg, 48.8% and 35.4% for hydrochar. The porosity, crystallinity and thermal stability of the hydrochar were improved remarkably compared to rice straw after MIHTC. Two characteristic peaks from XRD were observed at 2Î¸ of 15Â° and 26Â°, whereas DTG peaks were observed at 50-150 Â°C and 300-350 Â°C for both the materials. Based on the results, it can be suggested that the hydrochar could be potentially used for adsorption, carbon sequestration, energy and agriculture applications."
"An investigation of shippers’ satisfaction and behaviour towards corporate social responsibility in maritime transport Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy Anchoring on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), the current paper investigates the moderating influences of shippersâ€™ corporate social responsibility (CSR) beliefs on their satisfaction and behaviour towards shipping firmsâ€™ involvement in CSR. It also analyses organisational and environmental factors that shape shippersâ€™ CSR beliefs. Survey data were obtained from 276 shippers with business offices located in Singapore, and analysed using multi-sampling approach and linear regression modelling. The results show that shippers with strong CSR beliefs derive greater satisfaction, and exhibit stronger behavioural intentions towards shipping firmsâ€™ involvement in CSR. In addition, shippersâ€™ CSR beliefs are influenced by shippersâ€™ organisational characteristics such as (1) firm's age, (2) firm's size, (3) degree of internationalisation, (4) types of products shipped, and environmental factors such as (5) perceived environmental and social threats, (6) perceived level of competition, and (7) level of CSR practices in headquarters. The results contribute to TPB research application in both B2C and B2B contexts, and motivate changes to the current marketing and communication practices of shipping firms."

"A Bourdieusian analysis of employment services workers in an era of Workfirst Employment Service; Activation; Welfare Reform This article draws on qualitative research which focused on worker experiences of Workfirst activation during the Job Services Australia (JSA) contract of employment services. The Workfirst orientation of Australian labour market programmes created imperatives for activation workers to monitor job seeker compliance with activity tests. As part of the broader cohort interviewed in the study, activation workers were interviewed about the way sanctions were used to discipline job seekers in street-level exchanges. These workers had experienced the transition from the Job Network to JSA and had observed how a shift to Workfirst became institutionalised in organisational practices and culture. Concepts from Bourdieu's field theory are used to situate activation workers in the employment services field that became more managerial during the transition to Workfirst and where sanction-based practice was mainstreamed. Drawing also on Peillon's sociology of welfare, employment services are described as part of the welfare field in which the activation workers experienced the misrecognition associated with Workfirst, which is described as a structure of domination. The analysis employs the concept of intersubjective recognition to draw attention to the subjective and objective co-construction of street-level interactions. This study has implications for understanding how welfare reforms affect activation workers, the contributors to the erosion of employment services capability, and the need for investment in workforce development in the employment services sector."
"Image-Based Sexual Abuse: Online Distribution Channels and Illicit Communities of Support Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica This article investigates the nature and scope of image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) material on 77 high-volume online websites. On the majority of these sites, users appeared to be motivated by sexual gratification and proving masculinity to a sexually deviant peer network, rather than revenge against the person depicted in the image. We argue that nonconsensual image exchanges are contextualized within ever-expanding digital environments, characterized by dislocation of time and space, overvisualization, and hypersexuality. We argue that IBSA is a vehicle for the construction, performativity, and negotiation of hypermasculinity and heteronormativity, within the bounds and structures of existing gendered power relations."

"Relationship between Southern Bluefin Tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, melanomacrophage centres and Cardicola spp. (Trematoda: Aporocotylidae) infection Opecoelidae; Digenea (Trematoda); Animals Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT), Thunnus maccoyii, is ranched off Port Lincoln, South Australia and is Australia's second largest economic finfish aquaculture industry. The biggest threats to SBT health identified by the industry are the blood flukes Cardicola forsteri and C. orientalis (Trematoda: Aporocotylidae). Melanomacrophage centres (MMCs) are aggregations of pigmented macrophage like cells present in spleen, kidney and liver of teleost fish. The aim of this study was to quantify MMCs in SBT anterior kidney, liver and spleen to investigate changes in relation to Cardicola spp. Infection. Samples were collected at the end of ranching from pontoons where SBT were treated with PZQ and pontoons with untreated SBT. SBT MMC percentage of surface area cover was highest in SBT spleen and lowest in the liver. Significant positive correlations were identified between SBT MMC area and SBT size in all three organs (p < 0.05). MMC area and parasite infection showed significant positive correlations in the kidney and spleen for Cardicola spp. gill egg counts, and in the kidney for C. forsteri DNA from SBT hearts and gills (p < 0.05). MMCs area increased with increased intensity of Cardicola spp. Infection and MMCs have the potential to be used as an indicator to assess health effects that Cardicola spp. have on SBT."
"Technological, nutritional and sensory properties of pasta fortified with agro-industrial by-products: a review Noodles; Pasta; Flour Reducing food waste is a priority to move towards more sustainable food systems. Since agro-food by-products are often rich in healthy compounds, such as fibre, phytochemicals, protein, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals, the waste valorisation could move through their transformation into ingredients useful for the formulation of functional foods. Pasta is a staple food widely consumed all over the world representing an optimal carrier for nutrients delivery. The incorporation of ingredients of a high added value obtained by agro-industrial by-products in pasta can improve its nutritional value and provides several health benefits. At the same time, the inclusion of new ingredients could modify the physical, chemical and textural properties determining the change of the organoleptic characteristics of fortified pasta, affecting its acceptability. Thus, the preparation of new pasta formulations with high nutritional properties, good technological and sensory characteristics represents a challenge for the food industry."
"The social practices of hosting P2P social dining events: insights for sustainable tourism Platforms; Collaborative Consumption; Peer to Peer In many ways, the expansion of commercial for-profit, P2P social dining platforms has mirrored those within mobility and accommodation sectors. However its dynamics and impacts have received less consideration to date, with a notable paucity of attention to the hosts of social dining events. The aim of this paper is to address this research lacuna. Through its exploration of the social dining platforms VizEat in Athens and Eatwith in Barcelona, this paper identifies, analyses and compares the social practices of hosts around their social dining events in two key tourist destinations in Europe. Data is gathered through multiple methods from participating in and observing social dining events in each city to interviews with key stakeholders in the P2P social dining process (such as hosts, platform employees and ambassadors). The research reveals how dynamic rules, tools, skills and understandings shape and reshape the performance of hosting social dining events. It exposes tensions and ongoing negotiations between hosts and guests regarding matters of authenticity and privacy, an uneven risk burden between hosts and platforms with regards liability and scant regard for matters of sustainability. As a result there is little alignment between P2P social dining and the goals of sustainable tourism."
"Micropollutant investigation in Diamond Creek The aims of this study are to measure concentrations of soluble organic chemicals in sites upstream and downstream of a township in the Yarra Valley. Passive samplers will be deployed for a set period of time, then analysed for a range of chemicals that may be linked to wastewater pollution. An evidence-based understanding of wastewater-related contaminants and how these impact ecological values will enable a more structured and strategic process for prioritising the investigation and management of sewage inputs.
In addition to the monitoring of the township, additional passive samplers are to be deployed at locations upstream of three YVW treatment plant sites: Craigieburn STP, Brushy Ck STP and Upper Yarra STP. This will complement downstream sampling at those STPs being conducted as part of the RMIT Aquatic Pollution Prevention Partnership with Melbourne Water."
"Understanding Australia's national feral cat control effort Dingoes; Mammals; Vulpes Vulpes Context. Feral cats (Felis catus) pose a significant threat to Australia's native species and feral cat control is, therefore, an important component of threatened species management and policy. Australia's Threatened Species Strategy articulates defined targets for feral cat control. Yet, currently, little is known about who is engaged in feral cat control in Australia, what motivates them, and at what rate they are removing feral cats from the environment. Aims. We aim to document who is engaging in feral cat control in Australia, how many cats they remove and to estimate the number of feral cats killed in a single year. Furthermore, we seek to better understand attitudes towards feral cat control in Australia. Methods. We used a mixed methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative techniques. Feral cat control data were obtained from existing data repositories and via surveys targeting relevant organisations and individuals. A bounded national estimate of the number of feral cats killed was produced by combining estimates obtained from data repositories and surveys with modelled predictions for key audience segments. Attitudes towards feral cat control were assessed by exploring qualitative responses to relevant survey questions. Key results. We received information on feral cat control from three central repositories, 134 organisations and 2618 individuals, together removing more than 35 000 feral cats per year. When including projections to national populations of key groups, the estimated number of feral cats removed from the environment in the 2017-2018 financial year was 316 030 (95% CI: 297 742-334 318). Conclusions. Individuals and organisations make a significant, and largely unrecorded, contribution to feral cat control. Among individuals, there is a strong awareness of the impact of feral cats on Australia's biodiversity. Opposition to feral cat control focussed largely on ethical concerns and doubts about its efficacy. Implications. There is significant interest in, and commitment to, feral cat control among some groups of Australian society, beyond the traditional conservation community. Yet more information is needed about control methods and their effectiveness to better understand how these efforts are linked to threatened species outcomes."

"Processes and institutions for scientific independence: Reflections on land & water Australia Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Independent and impartial scientific research provides critical contributions to many contemporary policy debates, including those about climate adaptation and natural resources. Therefore, institutional arrangements that enable and protect scientific independence are central to resolving environ mental problems in advanced liberal democracies. This paper provides an overview of the research and development (R&D) funding organisation Land & Water Australia (LWA) that, due to its statutory independence, was effective and influential in promoting sustainable natural resource management. Established by legislation that provided structural independence, LWA was insulated from direct interference, enabling it to operate at armâ€™s length from executive government. The paper profiles LWA contributions to changing policies and practices, and explores the features that enabled LWA to co ordinate, organise and fund R&D, until its abolition in 2009. LWA provided a useful precedent of a statutory authority, chartered with a clear legislated purpose and legal mechanisms for ensuring independence. The paper highlights institutional arrangements that protect scientific independence, arguing that LWA provided an important model of public R&D investment directed to sustainability transformations."

"Ladies selling breakfast: COVID-19 disruption of intimate socialities among street-engaged food traders in Ho Chi Minh city Vietnam; Wildcat Strike; Urbanization Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnamâ€™s largest city, supports a vibrant street food culture. Most of the cityâ€™s street-engaged food traders are poor and unskilled women, and there is scant research about how they build social networks and social capital that sustain their micro-businesses. This article focusses on the intimate socialities that street-engaged food traders develop with customers, shop owners and sister-traders in order to stabilise their incomes while their informal street-trading activities are policed and potentially shut down. Recent COVID-19 lockdown and social-distancing measures disrupted the crucial interpersonal relations of street trading and left the traders with no income. This article explores tradersâ€™ strate-gies for achieving economic security, and outlines transformations of intimate socialities into mediated and digital relations after the lockdown."

"Non-coding RNAs in legumes: Their emerging roles in regulating biotic/abiotic stress responses and plant growth and development Argonaute Proteins; Gene; Nicotiana Benthamiana Noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interference RNAs (siRNAs), circular RNA (circRNA), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), control gene expression at the transcription, post-transcription, and translation levels. Apart from protein-coding genes, accumulating evidence supports ncRNAs playing a critical role in shaping plant growth and development and biotic and abiotic stress responses in various species, including legume crops. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) interact with DNA, RNA, and proteins, modulating their target genes. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling these cellular processes are not well understood. Here, we discuss the features of various ncRNAs, including their emerging role in contributing to biotic/abiotic stress response and plant growth and development, in addition to the molecular mechanisms involved, focusing on legume crops. Unravelling the underlying molecular mechanisms and functional implications of ncRNAs will enhance our understanding of the coordinated regulation of plant defences against various biotic and abiotic stresses and for key growth and development processes to better design various legume crops for global food security."

"Towards the spectral mapping of plastic debris on beaches Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Floating and washed ashore marine plastic debris (MPD) is a growing environmental challenge. It has become evident that secluded locations including the Arctic, Antarctic, and remote islands are being impacted by plastic pollution generated thousands of kilometers away. Optical remote sensing of MPD is an emerging field that can aid in monitoring remote environments where in-person observation and data collection is not always feasible. Here we evaluate MPD spectral features in the visible to shortwave infrared regions for detecting varying quantities of MPD that have accumulated on beaches using a spectroradiometer. Measurements were taken from a range of in situ MPD accumulations ranging from 0.08% to 7.94% surface coverage. Our results suggest that spectral absorption features at 1215 nm and 1732 nm are useful for detecting varying abundance levels of MPD in a complex natural environment, however other absorption features at 931 nm, 1045 nm and 2046 nm could not detect in situ MPD. The reflectance of some in situ MPD accumulations was statistically different from samples that only contained organic debris and sand between 1.56% and 7.94% surface cover; however other samples with similar surface cover did not have reflectance that was statistically different from samples containing no MPD. Despite MPD being detectable against a background of sand and organic beach debris, a clear relationship between the surface cover of MPD and the strength of key absorption features could not be established. Additional research is needed to advance our understanding of the factors, such as type of MPD assemblage, that contribute to the bulk reflectance of MPD contaminated landscapes."
"Temporary homes in disaster hit areas Temporary Housing; Disaster; Tsunamis Temporary housing plays a critical role in post disaster recovery efforts but due to their unsustainability, cultural inadequacies, and being expensive they are not seen as a suitable resolution Thus, due to the need of an integrated and more responsive strategy has becomes evident to better utilize the recovery and relief resources.

"Potential of Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis salina for nutrient and organic matter removal from municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) poses health and environmental risks on its disposal as it contains nutrients and harmful organic compounds at elevated concentrations. This study compared a freshwater microalga Chlorella vulgaris and a marine microalga Nannochloropsis salina in suspended and alginate-immobilised cultures for batch and semi-continuous treatment of the ROC. The immobilised algae gave comparable nutrient removal rates to the suspended cells, demonstrating immobilisation had no apparent negative impact on the photosynthetic activity of microalgae. Semi-continuous algal treatment illustrated that the microalgae could remove significant amounts of nutrients (> 50% and > 80% for TN and TP, respectively), predominantly through algal uptake (> 90%), within a short period (48 h) and generate 335â€“360 mg DCW L-1 d-1 of algal biomass. The treatment also removed a significant amount of organic matter (12.7â€“13.3 mg DOC L-1 d-1), primarily (> 65%) through the biotic pathway."
"Technology-Facilitated Domestic Violence Against Immigrant and Refugee Women: A Qualitative Study Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Help-Seeking Digital technologies are increasingly being used as tools for the perpetration of domestic violence. Little empirical research to date has explored the nature and impacts of technology-facilitated domestic violence (TFDV), and even less attention has been paid to the experiences of immigrant and refugee women. This article examines the nature and impacts of TFDV as experienced by immigrant and refugee women. Drawing on interviews with 29 victim-survivors and 20 stakeholders, we argue that although immigrant and refugee women may experience TFDV in similar ways to non-immigrant and refugee women, they face unique challenges, such as language barriers, cultural bias from support services, lack of financial resources, lack of trust in state institutions, and additional challenges with justice and migration systems. Immigrant and refugee women also face multiple structural layers of oppression and social inequality. Accordingly, we argue that a multifaceted approach is required to address TFDV that includes culturally sensitive and specific law reform, education, and training."

"Financial inclusion and its impact on financial efficiency and sustainability: Empirical evidence from Asia Financial Development; Economic Growth; Trade Openness This study examines the trend of financial inclusion in Asia and its impact on financial efficiency and financial sustainability. For this purpose, the study employs a sample of 31 Asian countries during the period spanning from 2004 to 2016. Composite indicators for the three financial dimensions are constructed using principal component analysis (PCA) based on normalized variables. We find that the trends are fluctuating across countries and there is no clear pattern in several cases. The findings are robust to different normalization techniques. Furthermore, the impact of financial inclusion on financial efficiency and sustainability is analysed using Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS). The estimation results indicate that growing financial inclusion negatively affects financial efficiency while favourably influences financial sustainability. The findings hold for the whole sample as well as across the two subsamples of countries with different income levels. This implies that while there are policy synergies between growing financial inclusion and maintaining financial sustainability, proper attention needs to be paid to the side effect of financial inefficiency associated with increasing financial inclusion."
"Exploring blockchain for sustainability in the food supply chain: An affordance approach Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices For sustainable development, supply chains need to simultaneously pursue economic, social, and environmental sustainability goals, collectively known as the triple bottom line (TBL). Touted as a disruptive technology for supply chains to attain sustainability, blockchain had a slow and patchy diffusion. This research-in-progress paper explores how food supply chains (FSCs) can develop affordances from blockchain to address critical challenges and improve the TBL performance. It proposes a conceptual model, based on affordance-actualization theory, linking sustainability critical success factors in the FSC to blockchain-enabled affordances and the resulting TBL improvements. The study offers modest contributions to theory by linking affordances with TBL improvement in the FSC which guides future research in exploring how a blockchain-enabled FSC pursues sustainable development."

"Confined Synthesis: From Layered Titanate to Highly Efficient and Durable Mesoporous Cu/TiO2Hydrogen Evolution Photocatalysts Hydrogen Production; Photocatalysts; Titanium Dioxide Highly efficient, durable, and earth-Abundant photocatalysts are of great interest toward practical photocatalytic conversion reactions, such as hydrogen generation and CO2 reduction. In this work, the intercalation and confinement of ""copper ions""within layered titanate nanosheets enabled preparation of copper-modified TiO2 mesoporous spheres (Cu/TiO2), which contain well-dispersed small copper nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 3-5 nm over the TiO2 mesoporous spheres. Without a cocatalyst (e.g., Pt), the obtained samples exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity (13.45 mmol/g/h) and excellent durability during a cyclic HER testing for 120 h, compared against 2.41 mmol/g/h of Cu-modified P25 TiO2. Computational simulations suggest that the Fermi level of small copper nanoparticles is located between the conduction band of TiO2 and the H+/H2 reduction potential, and if extrapolated to nanoparticles, then this holds for particles up to approximately 9 nm. This would efficiently facilitate electron trapping and then transfer from TiO2 to copper followed by the reduction reaction, leading to excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction."
"Performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine powered by macadamia and grapeseed biodiesels Fuel Tests; Diesel Engines; Biofuel Biodiesel is an alternative, eco-friendly and renewable source of energy. It can be produced from a wide range of feedstocks which can be grown in marginal land use. It has drawn more attention to the researchers. In this study, the oil extraction, biodiesel conversion, and physiochemical properties of Macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia) and Grapeseed (Vitis vinifera) biodiesels are presented. The experimental investigation of diesel engine performance, emissions and combustion characteristics were conducted using B5 (5% biodiesel and 95% diesel by volume) and B10 (10% biodiesel and 90% diesel by volume) blends. The engine performance parameters, such as brake power (BP), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) have been investigated in this experiment. The emission parameters, for example, carbon monoxide (CO), the ratio of CO2/CO, nitrogen oxide (NOx), hydrocarbon (HC), particulate matter (PM) have been measured during the experiment. Finally, the combustion parameters such as cylinder pressure (CP) were recorded, and heat release rate (HRR) was analysed and compared with that of diesel fuel. The study revealed that the Macadamia biodiesel performed better than Grapeseed biodiesel and behaved closely to that of diesel fuel. A significant reduction of engine emissions was found in the case of Macadamia biodiesel with a minimal reduction of engine performance. Further analysis of energy, exergy and tribological characteristics of the Macadamia biodiesel is recommended for assessing its feasibility for commercial application."

"Challenges Inherent in Controlling Prickly Pear Species; a Global Review of the Properties of Opuntia stricta, Opuntia ficus-indica and Opuntia monacantha Dactylopius; Hemiptera; Cactaceae Opuntia species (prickly pear) were deliberately introduced to many countries around the world for fruit, cochineal dye production, living fencing or as ornamentals. They are now some of the worldâ€™s most significant weeds, particularly in regions with warm and or dry climates, as they pose threats to economic and environmental assets. In addition, they can cause considerable health issues for humans and animals. Opuntia spp. have prolific reproduction abilities, being able to reproduce both vegetatively and by seed. They have generalist pollination and dispersal requirements, which promotes their establishment and spread. Opuntia stricta, O. monacantha and O. ficus-indica are the most globally widespread of the Opuntia spp. In many countries, biological control agents, particularly the cactus moth (Cactoblastis cactorum) and various cochineal insects from the Dactylopius genus, have successfully reduced land-scape scale populations. On a smaller scale, controlling these weeds by either injecting or spraying the cladodes with herbicides can provide effective control. Care must be taken during herbicide treatments as any untreated areas will regenerate. While biological control is the most cost and time effective control method for landscape-scale infestations, further research into the combined efficacy of herbicides, fire, grubbing and pre-burial techniques would be beneficial for land managers to control small-scale and establishing populations. It would also be useful to have greater knowledge of the potential seedbank longevity and seed ecology of these species so that integrated management strategies can be developed to not only deal with initial populations but also the subsequent seedling regrowth."

"Assessing a priori acceptance of shared dockless e-scooters in Iran Car Sharing; Bike; Autonomous Vehicles This paper evaluates a priori acceptance of shared dockless e-scooters in Iran using the extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The proposed extended model includes subjective norms, hedonic motivation, and environmental awareness in the acceptance of e-scooters in addition to the original TAM constructs. Also, two open-ended questions were proposed to assess the role of control beliefs. Data were collected from an online survey of 1078 participants. Structural Equation Modeling was used to evaluate the proposed model. Besides the original TAM constructs, subjective norms were found to be the strongest predictor of intention. Environmental awareness was also a significant predictor. Results from open-ended questions revealed that most participants believed using e-scooters instead of motorcycles and private cars on short-distance trips could help the environment, and its positive effects outweigh their disadvantages. On the other hand, the lack of specific rules in their use and safety-related issues are the main barriers."

"Recent Progress, Challenges, and Prospects in Two-Dimensional Photo-Catalyst Materials and Environmental Remediation Cyanogen; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Photocatalysts The successful photo-catalyst library gives significant information on feature that affects photo-catalytic performance and proposes new materials. Competency is considerably significant to form multi-functional photo-catalysts with flexible characteristics. Since recently, two-dimensional materials (2DMs) gained much attention from researchers, due to their unique thickness-dependent uses, mainly for photo-catalytic, outstanding chemical and physical properties. Photo-catalytic water splitting and hydrogen (H2) evolution by plentiful compounds as electron (eâˆ’) donors is estimated to participate in constructing clean method for solar H2-formation. Heterogeneous photo-catalysis received much research attention caused by their applications to tackle numerous energy and environmental issues. This broad review explains progress regarding 2DMs, significance in structure, and catalytic results. We will discuss in detail current progresses of approaches for adjusting 2DMs-based photo-catalysts to assess their photo-activity including doping, hetero-structure scheme, and functional formation assembly. Suggested plans, e.g., doping and sensitization of semiconducting 2DMs, increasing electrical conductance, improving catalytic active sites, strengthening interface coupling in semiconductors (SCs) 2DMs, forming nano-structures, building multi-junction nano-composites, increasing photo-stability of SCs, and using combined results of adapted approaches, are summed up. Hence, to further improve 2DMs photo-catalyst properties, hetero-structure design-based 2DMsâ€™ photo-catalyst basic mechanism is also reviewed.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]"

"Improving drought resilience in Northern Murray-Darling Basin farming communities: Is forecast-based financing suitable? Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China A trend towards drier conditions during the April to October â€˜coolâ€™ season across southern Australia has been observed in the past few decades. Frequent and prolonged droughts have a significant impact on the financial stability of affected farming communities. Forecast-based Financing (FbF) is a novel proactive aid approach that provides support measures to increase resilience during the window between drought early warnings, and the actual onset and intensification of drought. Using the Northern Murray-Darling Basin as a case study, we investigated whether FbF combined with a user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought has the potential to increase the drought resilience of Australian farming communities. This study shows that farming businesses most impacted by drought have three common factors: (i) lower levels of business management skills, (ii) lower levels of pre-drought preparedness during non-drought periods, and (iii) slower responses when the intensity of drought increases. The results suggest that FbF in its current form is not recommended for a market economy such as Australia, as forms of direct assistance may have adverse long-term effects through disrupting the market itself and may not encourage farm operators to regularly assess and adapt their drought management strategies. Results also suggest that providing farmers, service providers, and all levels of government with tools that incorporate a user-centred I-EWS for drought can improve overall decision-making before, during, and even after drought. This change from a reactive to a proactive approach to managing drought impacts can be a highly effective form of increasing the drought resilience of farming communities."
"Nuclear power in emerging economies and human resouce Development: A review Kazakhstan; Latvia; Ukraine Rapid expansion of nuclear technologies and nuclear energy for power generation in emerging (developing) countries necessitate undertaking urgent skills development programs. Skilled human resource is a vital first step in ensuring a sustainable supply of qualified/competent personnel for the safe, responsible and sustainable use of nuclear technologies. This paper highlights the current trend of global nuclear power plant development in new comer countries. It also emphasis the need for skilled human resource development programs that are required for sustainable management of nuclear power plants during construction, operation, maintenance and repair for the safe and secure operation. The national skills development program of a nuclear ambitious country must include human resource development, education and training, knowledge management, and knowledge networks at the national, regional and international level."
"Enhancing voltage regulation in DC microgrids using a price incentive load management approach Microgrid; DC-DC Converter; Electric Potential This paper studies the voltage regulation problem in DC microgrids in the presence of variable loads. DC microgrids generally include several Distributed Generation Units (DGUs), connected to electrical loads through DC power lines. The variable nature of loads at each spot, caused for example by moving electric vehicles, may cause voltage deregulation in the grid. To reduce this undesired effect, this study proposes an incentive-based load management strategy to balance the loads connected to the grid. The electricity price at each node of the grid is considered to be dependent on its voltage. This guide moving customers to connect to cheaper connection points, and ultimately results in even load distribution. Simulations show the improvement in the voltage regulation, power loss, and efficiency of the grid even when only a small portion of customers accept the proposed incentive."
"Mental Ill Health in Homeless Women: A Review Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease Research indicates that homeless women are reported to experience more mental health issues than women who are not homeless and are an increasing proportion of the overall homeless population. In addition, homeless women are more likely to have alcohol and/or other drug use disorders. We provide a comprehensive review of the contemporary literature that revealed homeless women experience a range of mental health problems including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol and other drug use disorders. Studies in this literature review indicate that some women have pre-existing mental health issues which precipitate homelessness while others develop mental illness because of their homelessness; domestic violence was also recognised as an antecedent to homelessness, although further research is needed in this area. The results of this study indicate that the homeless cohort is a complex one with distinct needs. We provide information that can help refine assessment processes and plan appropriate services to address the mental health needs of homeless women. Finally, recommendations for mental health nursing practice in regard to caring for homeless women are made."
"Adaptive governance in carbon farming policies Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework This book discusses a variety of different perspectives involved in biodiversity management and bio-sequestration projects in Australia, working towards achieving adaptive governance in carbon farming. It not only examines landholders' motivation but also the challenges of integrating biodiverse forests into the agricultural landscape. Drawing on the contrast between science and policy stakeholders' views on carbon farming and the practical challenges of achieving adaptive governance, the book discusses the significant gap between theory and practice encountered in this field of study. The book suggests ways of improving the decision-making capacity of government officials and policymakers involved in managing carbon and biodiversity markets, as well as introducing measures to promote adaptive governance by engaging landholders in more effective land conservation. Climate change is a pressing issue on the global political agenda, and this book makes an important contribution to the ongoing debate. This book will be an invaluable reference for practitioners, policymakers and researchers interested in alternative forms of governance in natural resource management."
"Explicating professional boxers' narrative dynamics towards competitive aggressiveness and potential market entry Entrepreneurial Intention; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship Research on subversive entrepreneurship considers the process in which firms outperform rivals when entering the market. Although the research has recognised that firms try to destroy the existing market while creating a new one, it still does not specify the narrative dynamics of subversive market entry. In this study, the market entry was studied in a non-business context (i.e., professional boxing), which widens the view of who could be entrepreneurial individuals. The subversive attributes were measured (applied both in boxing and business) in pre-event narratives that were then related to the competitive aggressiveness in post-event interview narratives. The results show a U-shaped relationship between the optimism and competitive aggressiveness content in these narratives and a negative linear relationship between these same variables. The result of an event moderates this effect into a positive one. These results contribute to the sport management literature by offering a perspective of sportsmen as entrepreneurial narrative generators and potential future entrepreneurs."

"Novel anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) design for wastewater treatment at long HRT and high solid concentration Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling Performance of two novel designed anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBRs) for wastewater treatment at long hydraulic retention time (HRT, 47 days) and high sludge concentration (22 gÂ·Lâˆ’1) was investigated. Results showed steady chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal (>98%) and mean biogas generation of 0.29 LCH4Â·gâˆ’1COD. Average permeates flux of 58.70 LÂ·mâˆ’2Â·hâˆ’1 and 54.00 LÂ·mâˆ’2Â·hâˆ’1 were achieved for reactors A and B, respectively. On top of reactor configuration, long HRT caused biofilm reduction by heterotrophic bacteria Chloroflexi resulting in high membrane flux. Mean total membrane resistances (2.23 Ã— 109 mâˆ’1) and fouling rates (4.00 Ã— 108 mâˆ’1Â·dayâˆ’1) of both reactors were low suggesting better membrane fouling control ability of both AnMBRs. Effluent quality analysis showed the effluent soluble microbial products (SMP) were dominated by proteins compared to carbohydrates, and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) analysis revealed effluent from both reactors had low aromaticity with SUVA < 1 (LÂ·mgâˆ’1Â·mâˆ’1) except for the first ten days."
"Energy poverty and obesity Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Obesity is a major health concern in both developed and developing nations. Yet, evidence on the determinants of obesity is relatively limited. We contribute to the literature on the determinants of obesity by empirically examining the effects of energy poverty on obesity. Using 14 waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, we find energy poverty is positively associated with obesity. Applying linear probability model, our estimates suggest that being energy poor results between 1.4 and 2.5 percentage points increase in the probability of being obese, depending on how energy poverty is measured. Our results are robust to alternative modelling techniques, inclusion of additional control variables and potential influence of unobservable. We also find that amount of sleep, health status and level of psychological distress are important transmission channels through which energy poverty influences the probability of being obese."
"Factors affecting the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices: Findings from panel data for Vietnam Agriculture; Indo-Gangetic Plain; Tillage Conventional farming and climate change are placing considerable stress on agricultural systems around the world, leading to increased hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, particularly in developing countries. Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) can help raise productivity and agricultural incomes while minimising negative environmental impacts. While recognising that sustainability is a contested term, we identify agricultural practices that are generally viewed as sustainable as they minimise impacts on the environment. Despite the benefits of SAPs, adoption rates are still low in developing countries. While previous studies have examined the factors affecting SAP adoption, most have not accounted for issues of heterogeneity and endogeneity inherent in such analysis. In this paper, we address this by employing a random-effects probit model with the Mundlak approach and fixed-effects linear probability models to control for farmer- and plot-level heterogeneities and to avoid the incidental parameters problem. We analyse panel data from Vietnam for approximately 14,000 plots over the period 2008â€“2016 to identify the factors behind SAP adoption. Overall, we find that improved knowledge transferred by extension agents and learning from peers significantly influence adoption. Farmers' knowledge of their land and soil quality are also important factors. We recommend enhancing cooperation between extension agents, farmer groups and peers in order to encourage SAP adoption."

"Beyond Formal Ethics Reviews: Reframing the Potential Harms of Sexual Violence Research Sexual Assault; Participation; Intimate Partner Violence Given the recent surge of research about sexual violence, it is timely to revisit the role of ethics in this field. This article examines two key frameworks which govern ethics in sexual violence research: institutional risk management and trauma discourse. While recognising the importance of these frameworks, we argue that they share a narrow conceptualisation of the potential harms of sexual violence research. Drawing on the legacy of decades of feminist research on sexual violence, we call for a deeper engagement with ethical and epistemological questions of knowledge, positionality and power. We argue that researchers need to consider the broader social and political contexts that shape survivorsâ€™ lives and experiences of disclosure in undertaking ethical research. Sexual violence researchers must also consider the potential harms of their research on marginalised communitiesâ€“from questioning who is included in research, to the implications of the responses to violence advocated for. Utilising insights from feminist, critical and intersectional traditionsâ€“and reflections on our own experiences as sexual violence researchersâ€“we argue for ethical considerations to extend beyond risk management and medicalised trauma frameworks."

"Information systems development as value co-creation Product-service Systems; Service Economy; Value Co-Creation In this research, we investigate information systems development (ISD) as value co-creation and how different actors perform co-creation as an ISD approach. For this purpose, we present a case study of an ISD project that developed a digital game on the topic of climate change in a not-for-profit, intergovernmental context. The project had limited resources. It involved a number of youth and used a social media platform. We apply a taxonomic framework for value co-creation that we derived from a taxonomy of Web-based co-creation. The taxonomy had originally been developed for a commercial context and researchers have not empirically validated it before. Our study shows that the taxonomic framework explains the project as value co-creation especially with regard to co-creatorsâ€™ motivation and the types of value they created. We further discuss our findings in reference to information systems (IS) literature on service innovation. This literature contributes to additionally explaining what value co-creation is and how one can perform it as an instance of ISD practice. Against this background, we offer some propositions for how future ISD research could benefit from adopting a value co-creation perspective. Although we derived our findings from a specific project in a particular setting, we argue that they can be used to 1) prepare any co-creation project, 2) cope with co-creation during the development process by explaining co-creation as an approach to ISD, and 3) reflect and derive lessons learnt. While researchers need to further empirically validate these claims, we develop insight into value co-creation in ISD with respect to participatory approaches to ISD beyond conventional environments, roles, and participant and contributor types."
"Engaging accountants in value based healthcare: Strategic Performance Evaluation This research aims to advance the management accounting role in the movement toward value-based healthcare. Value-based healthcare is underpinned by efficiency and effectiveness in healthcare service delivery, and is positioned from a patient-driven value
perspective. This approach fosters technology and performance improvements which are currently confounded by business models that focus on volume-driven patient care. Fieldwork and interdisciplinary collaborations focus on the following research questions:
RQ 1: How do major healthcare service providers manage cost overruns and budget constraints, while supporting technological innovations that improve patient-centric healthcare journeys? RQ2: How can performance evaluation be improved to better support cost-benefit analysis of digital innovations in healthcare? Outputs of the fieldwork will support the development of a Continuous Professional Education (CPE) training module for emerging and professional accountants as well as healthcare clinician administrators. The training module offers a simulated hospital environment, whereby real data is used to support budgeting and performance evaluation training and engage administrators in strategic debate."
"The impact of terrestrial protected areas on vegetation extent and condition: A systematic review protocol Systematic Review; Collating; Conservation Management Background: Establishing protected areas is a key approach to protecting nature. However, protected areas are often biased towards remote and less productive lands. It is important to evaluate the impacts protected areas have had, or in other words, what changes in outcomes of interest are attributable to protected areas. Studies that evaluate the impact of protected areas on vegetation - the state and processes that support biodiversity - are scarce and published in a range of disciplines. This systematic review will scope, identify, and synthesize studies that quantitatively measure the impact of protected areas on vegetation extent and condition. The findings will be useful for researchers and policy makers and provide important knowledge for setting post 2020 targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity. This review will also identify research gaps in the current evidence base and provide direction for future research. Methods: This review follows the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence guidelines for evidence synthesis and complies with the ROSES (RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Synthesis) reporting framework. We will use a comprehensive search strategy developed through several rounds of scoping review to cover databases; Web of Science, Scopus and CAB Abstracts, 16 organizational websites, google scholar and existing review documents. Our search terms and strategies aim to find impact evaluation studies (both peer-reviewed and grey literature) in English from protected areas globally. The search results will be screened at title, abstract, and then full text by two independent reviewers. A quality appraisal of evidence will be conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) risk of bias tool. Review results will be presented in the form of narrative synthesis, as well as in meta-analysis form, where data quality and amount allow."

"‘Not a trend. It’s a tradition’: Remaking Pacific identity and culture at London Pacific Fashion Week 2019 Papua New Guinea; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Masculinity In recent years, the recognition of creative industries such as art, design, media and fashion has thrust these sectors into the spotlight as valuable tools for economic development and integration into global markets. By establishing themselves as creative hotspots, developing countries grow small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and promote creative entrepreneurs who are involved in transforming culture. While an emphasis on incorporating â€˜cultureâ€™ into design might also be seen as stultifying or essentializing culture, stakeholders working in the region consistently emphasize the significance of incorporating local cultures into their creations. In this article, we draw on interviews with Pacific designers and fashion festival organizers to demonstrate the range of ways in which â€˜cultureâ€™ is woven into the story of Pacific fashion. In doing so, we highlight the ways in which participants are â€˜remakingâ€™ cultural identity and expression by â€˜spinning it into something newâ€™, keeping cultural connections alive and personal for those involved in these industries, while also allowing makers to situate their brand or product in the global market. Furthermore, we suggest that involvement in the world of fashion on a global scale represents an opportunity for participants to explore more inclusive and diverse versions of Pacific identity than those sanctioned or imagined outside the world of fashion."
"Simulating urban expansion in a rapidly changing landscape in eastern Tarai, Nepal Sleuths; Cellular Automaton Model; Urbanization Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of urbanization and predicting future growth is now essential for sustainable urban planning and policy making. This study explores future urban expansion in the rapidly growing region of eastern lowland Nepal. We used the hybrid cellular automata-Markov (CA-Markov) model, which utilizes historical land use and land cover (LULC) maps and several biophysical change driver variables to predict urban expansion for the years 2026 and 2036. Transitional area matrices were generated based on historical LULC data from 1996 to 2006, from 2006 to 2016, and from 1996 to 2016. The approach was validated by cross comparing the actual and simulated maps for 2016. Evaluation gave satisfactory values of Kno (0.89), Kstandard (0.84), and Klocation (0.89) which verifies the accuracy of the model. Hence, the CA-Markov model was utilized to simulate the LULC map for the years 2026 and 2036. The study area experienced rapid peri/urban expansion and sharp decline in area of cultivated land during 1989â€“2016. Built-up area increased by 110.90 km 2 over a period of 27 years at the loss of 87.59 km 2 cultivated land. Simulation analysis indicates that urban expansion will continue with urban cover increasing to 230 km 2 (8.95%) and 318.51 km 2 (12.45%) by 2026 and 2036, respectively, with corresponding declines in cultivated land to 1453.83 km 2 (56.86%) and 1374.93 km 2 (53.77%) for the same years. The alarming increase in urban areas coupled with loss of cultivated land will have negative implications for food security and environmental equilibrium in the region."
"Water Crystallisation of Model Sugar Solutions with Nanobubbles Produced from Dissolved Carbon Dioxide Crystallization; Melting; Supercooling This study was conducted to examine the influence of CO2 nanobubbles on crystallisation behaviour of water during freezing of model sugar (2â€“5%w/v) solutions. CO2 gas was dissolved at 0, 1000, and 2000-ppm concentrations before freezing. Carbonated sugar solutions in 50 mL plastic tubes were immersed in a pre-cooled (âˆ’15 Â°C) ethylene glycol bath and left to freeze at âˆ’15 Â°C for 90 min. When the temperature of the solutions reached 0 Â°C, ultrasound (US; 20 kHz) was emitted in the bath for 20 s duration through a metal horn transducer. The US wave applied in the ethylene glycol bath was expected to propagate to the sugar solutions in the tube and promote gas bubble formation from dissolved CO2, which will trigger the ice nucleation. Obtained freezing curves were analysed for nucleation time and temperature, supercooling degree, and time taken for phase change. In general, the CO2 gas promoted freezing of water, causing a noticeable shift in nucleation parameters. For example, nucleation time of 2000-ppm carbonated water coupled with sonication emission for 20 s (7.8 min) was much shorter than that of controls (pure water without any treatment = 19.1 min and US only = 14.3 min). The former initiated ice nucleation just below sub-zero temperature (âˆ’0.2 Â°C) whereas the onset temperature of controls (pure water without any treatment = âˆ’11.3 Â°C and the US only treatment = âˆ’10.3 Â°C). A similar effect was observed with different model sugar solutions. The current findings can be applied to refine the manufacturing process of ice-cream and frozen desserts by the food industries."
"Research priorities and best practices for managing climate risk and climate change adaptation in Australian agriculture Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience The challenges of climate change adaptation in agriculture are examined through the lens of priorities for research, and the use of best management practices (BMPs) to better manage climate risks. The methods and results have two parts. Firstly, a case study from the northern grains region examines the use of BMPs for managing climate risks associated with both climate variability and climate change. A series of industry workshops developed and tested a suite of 24 BMP standards for growing dryland grain crops, including four BMPs on risk management based on the Australian Standards for Risk Management. Secondly, priorities for research on climate change adaptation in the primary industries sector are described and evaluated to assess needs for updating, in response to industry and environmental changes. The analysis reveals strong reasons for increasing the priority given to education and extension on risk management and for developing BMPs for both incremental and transformative adaptation, and especially for deriving methods to achieve widespread adoption of BMPs for managing extreme climatic events. Collaborative development of BMPs involving farmersâ€™/industry/scientists is the process most likely to derive robust BMPs to withstand the complexities of climate risk and build greater resilience of communities and ecosystems."
"Increasing Use of Human-Dominated Habitats as CO2 Emissions Warm and Acidify Oceans Biodiversity; Patellogastropoda; Intertidal Community Urban and artificial structures are increasingly added to the worldâ€™s coasts during a time in which changing climate is forecast to drive shifts in naturally occurring habitats. We ask whether the role of artificial structures as marine habitats will increase in importance relative to their natural counterparts, particularly as natural habitats are negatively affected by ocean warming and acidification. To evaluate this model, we contrasted use of natural (kelp forest and turfing algae) and artificial habitat (plastic pier-piling) by a nest-building amphipod (Cymadusa pemptos) under current and future climate conditions of CO2 and temperature. Under future conditions, amphipod populations in mesocosms increased, but this did not lead to greater proportional colonization of kelp and turf. Instead, colonization doubled in artificial habitats, and there was increasing production and occupation of nests on artificial habitats relative to natural habitats. In an age when human modification of natural substrata is increasingly cited as an agent of wildlife decline, understanding the future role of artificial habitats as replacement dwellings for natural habitats is critical. We pioneer an understanding of the future role of natural and artificial habitats, identifying the possibility that the role of urban structures as marine habitats may only increase."
"Anaerobic digested effluent phycoremediation by microalgae co-culture and harvesting by Moringa oleifera as natural coagulant Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water In this study, a microalgal co-culture of Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp. was cultivated in a photobioreactor (PBR). The microalgal biomass was then harvested by locally available and inexpensive natural coagulants, Moringa oleifera seed powder. Overall microalgal growth rate, biomass productivity, and nutrient efficiency have been analyzed. The linear correlation among the ammonia-N (NH3â€“N), orthophosphate (PO43), and microalgae concentration demonstrated that nitrogen and phosphorus removal had been dominated by microalgal assimilation. The experimental results suggested that the anaerobic reactor effluent was a useful substrate for microalgae growth. The maximum biomass productivity and growth rate was 0.12 g/L/d and 0.50 dayâˆ’1, respectively, and almost 89 Â± 1% of the nutrient was removed within 5 days. Besides, Moringa oleifera seed powder showed a very high microalgal biomass harvesting efficiency of 85%. Hence, it can be concluded that this cost-effective microalgae cultivation and harvesting method could tailor a promising phycoremediation application worldwide."
"‘Two different worlds’: Papua New Guinean women working in development in Port Moresby Papua New Guinea; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Masculinity This article examines the lives of Port Moresby women who work in the development sector of Papua New Guinea. In particular, it demonstrates how development discourse structures the very fabric of working relationships within this sector in Port Moresby. Underpinned by neocolonial geographies in which those in the global north rescue those in the global south, these discourses produce workplaces in which Papua New Guinean women are seen as lacking the moral and technical capacities to run development projects in their own country. The article argues that the privileges held by expatriates and denied to local women, in conjunction with the workplace discrimination to which they are subjected, ironically undermine the development sector's supposed commitment to promoting gender equality in Papua New Guinea."
"Proteo-Molecular Investigation of Cultivated Rice, Wild Rice, and Barley Provides Clues of Defense Responses against Rhizoctonia solani Infection Leaf Blight; Thanatephorus Cucumeris; Quantitative Trait Loci Rhizoctonia solani is a soil-borne fungus causing sheath blight disease in cereal crops including rice. Genetic resistance to sheath blight disease in cereal crops is not well understood in most of the host(s). Aside from this, a comparative study on the different hosts at the biochemical and proteomic level upon R. solani infection was not reported earlier. Here, we performed proteomic based analysis and studied defense pathways among cultivated rice (cv. Pusa Basmati-1), wild rice accession (Oryza grandiglumis), and barley (cv. NDB-1445) after inoculation with R. solani. Increased levels of phenol, peroxidase, and Î²-1, 3-glucanase were observed in infected tissue as compared to the control in all of the hosts. Wild rice accession O. grandiglumis showed a higher level of biochemical signals than barley cv. NDB 1445 and cultivated rice cv. Pusa Basmati-1. Using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and mass spectrometry (MS), differently expressed proteins were also studied in control and after inoculation with R. solani. Wild rice accession O. grandiglumis induced a cysteine protease inhibitor and zinc finger proteins, which have defense functions and resistance against fungal pathogens. On the other hand, barley cv. NDB-1445 and cultivated rice cv. Pusa Basmati-1 mainly induce energy metabolism-related proteins/signals after inoculation with R. solani in comparison to wild rice accession O. grandiglumis. The present comprehensive study of R. solani interaction using three hosts, namely, Pusa Basmati-1 (cultivated rice), O. grandiglumis (wild rice), and NDB-1445 (barley) would interpret wider possibilities in the dissection of the protein(s) induced during the infection process. These proteins may further be correlated to the gene(s) and other related molecular tools that will help for the marker-assisted breeding and/or gene editing for this distressing disease among the major cereal crops."

"Neighbourhood Liveability Audits for 5 Townships Across the Mitchell Shire (DHHS) The purpose of providing neighbourhood level spatial analyses of liveabi lity for each of the 5 townships is to assist the Mitchell Shire in future planning activities, with particular acknowledgment of the expected rapid increase in population across the Shire over the next decade. Within the Mitchell Shire, the Beveridge North development alone is expected to accommodate more than 25,000 people in the future and Beveridge Central an additional 10,000 people. Seymour is expecting significant regeneration activity and Wallan is currently experiencing complex socia l and economic difficulties following a period of rapid population growth and difficulty accessing social infrastructure and community support services. Providing spatial indicators of liveability will provide evidence and benchmarking of liveability across the 5 towns to assist with future health and council planning needs using relevant indicators that measure the social determinants of health. Global efforts to integrate and map geospatial data from a wide range of sources is still in its infancy. Importantly,
this initiative also wi ll help to identify challenges, issues and opportunities for documenting the liveability of regional cities and rural communities."
"Exploring indigenous employee voice practice: perspectives from Vietnamese public sector organisations Employee Voice; Employment Relations; Workplace This study explores how the implementation of government policy with respect to Indigenous voice practice impacts on the workplace participation of Indigenous employees in Vietnamese public sector organisations. A qualitative case study approach was adopted capturing the perspectives of managers and Indigenous employees in three public sector agencies. The findings showed that, while government policies have led to increased Indigenous workforce participation, there are a range of barriers at the organisational level that limit and undermine workplace participation. These include first, inconsistencies in the interpretation and implementation of these policies at the organisational level due to the reliance on the discretion of individual managers. Second, the lack of awareness and commitment or even underlying racism of non-Indigenous managers which was exacerbated by inconsistency in direct employee voice practices.

Two soilborne biocontrol agents, the fungus Stromatinia cepivora and the bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Pcc) have previously been reported as killing A. triquetrum in gnotobiotic controlled conditions. This study aimed to find why glasshouse pot trials in complex potting media and field trials showed no effect of inoculation with either agent. Bacteria were consistently isolated from inside surface-sterilised bases and bulbs of A. triquetrum. Most bacteria from actively growing plants were closely related to Bacillus but one from dormant bulbs (RPTAtOch1) belonged to Ochrobactrum. Most bacteria reduced soft rot caused by Pcc in vitro by up to 100% when inoculated the day before Pcc. Co-cultivation with Pcc reduced its extracellular pectin lyase and polygalacturonase, which target plant cell walls. RPTAtOch1 was identified as O. quorumnocens by traditional physiological, biochemical and molecular tests, whole genome sequencing and Average Nucleotide Identity comparisons. Its draft genome consisted of 76 contigs, 70% of which were closest to isolate A44 of O. quorumnocens, which antagonises soft rotting of potato by Pcc by destroying its quorum-sensing lactones but, like RPTAtOch1, does not inhibit growth of Pcc. Also, endophytic bacteria inhibited germination of S. cepivora sclerotia and so prevented white rot. Thus, the failure in biocontrol of A. triquetrum by both S. cepivora and Pcc may be due, ironically, to biocontrol of the intended pathogens by endophytic bacteria inside the target weed."
"Remote Sensing of Riparian Vegetation Condition The objective of the project is to attempt to use remote sensing to classify riparian vegetation condition across Melbourne Water's region and across time. The project will cover all riparian areas (24,000 km) throughout Melbourne Water's region. Melbourne Water uses a categorical system of rating riparian vegetation condition, ranging from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Melbourne Water needs to report to our stakeholders, with regard to our progress with implementing the Healthy Waterways Strategy in 2022 and 2026 showing the current riparian vegetation condition and the vegetation condition in comparison to 2018. This is of particular importance in high quality (e.g level 4 and 5) riparian vegetation areas. The focus of year 1 of this research project is to ascertain whether it is likely to be possible to build a model to assess vegetation condition across Melbourne Water's entire waterway network and across time."

"The Performance of Rooftop Solar PV System in SouthEastern Australia: A Case Study Photovoltaic System; Tariffs; Solar The rising greenhouse gas emission caused by fossil fuel burning is a growing concern for sustainable living and the environment. Globally, over 33 billion tonnes of CO2 is generated yearly through fossil fuel burning (44% by coal, 34% by oil, and about 21% by natural gas). The power generation by fossil fuel accounts for a lion's share of this amount. Hence, power generation by renewable energy (especially by solar and wind) is an alternative way to meet the rising electric power demand and reduce CO2 emissions. Australia like many other countries is encouraging power generation by renewable energy. Within a short span of time, Australia has become a global leader for power generation through rooftop solar PV systems. However, limited information on the in-situ performance of solar rooftop systems is available in the public domain. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to investigate the in-situ power generation performance of rooftop solar PV systems and compare it with the predicted performance of such systems. The performance of two solar rooftop PV systems was studied and their performances were benchmarked. The study revealed that there is a significant variation in power generation between the same power generation wattage systems manufactured by different companies. The study also revealed that the power generation can be lower as much as 20% from the predicted performance of a rooftop PV solar system."

"A transformative mission for prioritising nature in Australian cities Cultural Ecosystem Services; China; Natural Capital Australia is experiencing mounting pressures related to processes of urbanisation, biodiversity loss and climate change felt at large in cities. At the same time, it is cities that can take the leading role in pioneering approaches and solutions to respond to those coupling emergencies. In this perspective piece we respond to the following question: What are the required transformations for prioritising, valuing, maintaining and embracing nature in cities in Australia? We adopt the mission framework as an organising framework to present proposed pathways to transform Australian cities as nature-positive places of the future. We propose three interconnected pathways as starting actions to steer urban planning, policy and governance in Australian cities: First, cities need to establish evidence-based planning for nature in cities and mainstream new planning tools that safeguard and foreground urban nature. Second, collaborative planning needs to become a standard practice in cities and inclusive governance for nature in cities needs to prioritise Aboriginal knowledge systems and practices as well as look beyond what local governments can do. Third, for progressing to nature-positive cities, it is paramount to empower communities to innovate with nature across Australian cities. Whilst we focus on Australian cities, the lessons and pathways are broadly applicably globally and can inspire science-policy debates for the post COP15 biodiversity and COP26 climate change implementation processes."
"Feasibility study and optimization of solar-assisted intermittent microwave–convective drying condition for potato Thin-Layer Drying; Drying; Solar Dryers Intermittent microwaveâ€“convective drying (IMCD) is an advanced drying technology that overcomes the shortcomings of microwave, convective, and microwaveâ€“convective drying. Research on the feasibility study of solar-assisted IMCD along with investigating its microstructure change, nutritional analysis, and appearance of dried food materials is inadequate. This research aims to investigate the effects of microwave intermittencyâ€”on quality attributes and structural changes of potato slices. In addition, optimization of pulse ratio has been performed in this study. Drying experiments, namely convective drying (CD) and IMCD, were conducted to assess the quality of dried potato slices. It was found that IMCD took only 12 min to complete the drying process, whereas CD took approximately 300 min. The optical (colour) and nutritional (vitamin C) properties of the IMCD dried potato slices appeared better than those of hot air-dried samples. The overall techno-economic analysis indicates that the proposed solar-assisted IMCD can dry an equal amount of potato while consuming one-tenth of the required energy of CD. Therefore, successful industrial application of the proposed drying system might be a stepping stone in the way to the advancement of energy-efficient food drying systems."
"Review of drivers and threats to coastal groundwater quality in China Nutrients; Submarines; Radon With rapid socio-economic development, China's coastal areas are among the fastest growing and most economically dynamic regions in the world. Under the influence of climate change and human activities, protecting the quality of coastal groundwater has emerged as one of the key environmental and resource management issues for these areas. This paper reviews (for the first time) groundwater quality data for the coastal basins of China, where over 600 million people live, focussing on key inorganic indicators/pollutants; groundwater salinity, nitrate, fluoride, and arsenic. These pollutants present major water quality issues and are also valuable as indicators of wider processes and influences impacting coastal groundwater quality â€“ e.g. saltwater intrusion, agricultural pollution and release of geo-genic contaminants. We discuss the major drivers causing water quality problems in different regions and assess future trajectories and challenges for controlling changes in coastal groundwater quality in China. Multiple processes, including modern and palaeo seawater/brine migration, groundwater pumping for agricultural irrigation, pollution from agrochemical application, rapid development of aquaculture, urban growth, and water transfer projects, may all be responsible (to different degrees) for changes observed in coastal groundwater quality, and associated long-term health and ecological effects. We discuss implications for sustainable coastal aquifer management in China, arguing that groundwater monitoring and contamination control measures require urgent improvement. The evolution and treatment of coastal groundwater quality problems in China will serve as an important warning and example for other countries facing similar pressures, due to climate change, coastal development, and intensification of anthropogenic activity in coming decades."
"Long-term impact of natural disasters on vietnamese income per capita: The case of typhoon durian Synthetic Control Method; Disasters; Cyclonic Storms This study estimates the effect of natural disasters on Vietnamese income per capita in both short and long-term. The analysis also evaluates the effects by sources of income including income from salary; income from agriculture, fishery, forest; and income from industry, construction, trade, and services. Typhoon Durian happened in December 2006 in southern provinces of Vietnam is chosen for the comparative case study. The analysis applies the Synthetic control method (SCM) to construct a counterfactual with respect to two different control groups and conducts a permutation test for the estimated values. The results show that typhoon Durian decreased aggregate income per capita of the affected region and the effect was long lasting. The reduction of monthly income per capita was estimated to be 56,925 VND which accounts for 7.9% of the total income. The most affected source of income is from agriculture, forestry, and fishery."
"Toxicity-removal efficiency of Brassica juncea, Chrysopogon zizanioides and Pistia stratiotes to decontaminate biomedical ash under non-chelating and chelating conditions: A pilot- scale phytoextraction study Soil Washing; Phytoaccumulation; Contaminated Soil The healthcare community acknowledged that bio-medical wastes (BMWs) have reached a colossal level across the globe. The recent pandemic (COVID-19) has brought a deluge of contaminated waste which calls for an urgent need of treatment technology for its safe disposal. BMW generally undergoes a conservative treatment approach of incineration which in turn generates potentially toxic ash known as BMW ash. BMW ash, if directly dumped in landfill, leaches and further pollutes both land and groundwater. The present study deployed Brassica juncea [Indian Mustard (IM)], Chrysopogon zizanioides [Vetiver Grass (VG)], and Pistia stratiotes [Water Lettuce (WL)] to remediate toxicity of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) i.e., Cd, Al, Pb, Cu, Mn, Co and Zn in BMW ash both in the presence and absence of chelate with an increased dosage of toxicity. The phyto-assessment results showed that IM extracted 202.2 Â± 0.1â€“365.5 Â± 0.02, 7.8 Â± 0.03â€“12.5 Â± 0.3, 132.1 Â± 0.1â€“327.3 Â± 0.1 and >100 mg kgâˆ’1 of Al, Cd, Pb and Zn, respectively without the assistance of a chelating agent. The VG accumulated heavy metals in greater concentration up to 10.5 Â± 0.1 and 290.1 Â± 0.05 mg kgâˆ’1 of Cd and Zn, respectively, and similar trends were observed in the WL set-up. However, the application of an ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) had also increased the efficiency on an average by 20â€“30% for IM, 35â€“45% for VG, and 25â€“35% for WL. The experimental set-up shows that the BCF for IM, VG and WL was found to be greater than 1 for most of the PTEs. The higher value of BCF resulted in a better ability to phytoextract the heavy metals from the soil. The results suggested that IM, VG and WL have the potential to phytoextract PTEs both in the absence and presence of chelating agents."
"Pandemic and teacher retention: empirical evidence from expat teachers in Southeast Asia during COVID-19 Teacher Evaluation; Teacher Labor Markets; Teacher Training Purpose: This research aims to explore the influence of expat teachers' attitude about local policies, and their subjective norms of social engagement during COVID-19 over their intention to leave the current country, due to COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses analysis of variance (ANOVA) and structural equation model (SEM) to examine the perception of crisis and the intention to leave among 307 expat teachers in Southeast Asia during COVID-19 and highlights the importance of policy responses and social engagement toward the minimum teacher turnover rate. Findings: The study reveals that, the higher perceived policy responses and community engagement the teachers acknowledge, the lower chance they will move to another country. Also, this paper presents the differences in expat teachers' perceptions and intentions among demographic factors such as teaching qualification, their current country of teaching, experience at the current country, income before, during and expected income after COVID-19. Originality/value: The paper justifies a conceptual framework which provides a hypothetical explanation about the influence of perceived policy responses and community engagement over expat teachers' intention to leave."

"“It just fits my needs better”: Autistic students and parents’ experiences of learning from home during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic Autism; Children with Developmental Disabilities; Caregivers Background and aims: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to people's lives, especially for families, whose children have been taken out of schools during lockdown restrictions and required to learn from home. Little is known, however, about the perceived impact of the lockdown restrictions on the educational experiences of autistic children and young people â€“ a group whose conventional schooling experiences are already often challenging. In this study, we sought to (1) understand these experiences from the perspectives of autistic young people and their parents, and (2) identify the underlying sources of positive experiences at this challenging time, in order to inform the ways in which autistic children might flourish at school in more normal times. Methods: Ninety-one Australian participants, including 16 autistic young people aged 12â€“18 years, 32 autistic parents and 43 non-autistic parents of autistic young people aged 3â€“18 years, took part in semi-structured interviews about their experiences of life during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The interviews were subjected to reflexive, thematic analysis to identify themes and subthemes for each research question. Results: Overall, our participants initially found the transition to learning from home extremely challenging, with parents reporting that the support received from schools was far from adequate. After that initial period of transition, however, many autistic children reported flourishing at home both educationally and personally. For these children and families, we identified three key ingredients essential to this flourishing, including: (i) the importance of connected, trusting relationships (â€˜peopleâ€™); (ii) the sensory and social safety of home (â€˜placeâ€™); and (iii) the flexibility to pace and structure learning to suit the individual child (â€˜timeâ€™). Conclusions: While the initial COVID-19 lockdown presented many challenges to children learning at home, there were aspects of this otherwise-unsettling situation that enabled children to thrive and from which we can learn for the future. Implications: These findings have important implications for understanding how and when autistic children might thrive in institutional educational settings once the pandemic subsides, focusing on the relationships between teachers and students, the nature of the physical learning environment and the need for greater flexibility in planning the school day."

"Phase 2 - Liveability data partnership for the National Cities Performance Framework (NCPF) Data on several aspects of liveability is required as an input to BITRE's annual updates of the NCPF Smart Cities Dashboard.
The Centre for Urban Research will partner with BITRE to develop four indicators for inclusion in the NCPF Smart Cities Dashboard, disaggregated from the existing access to social infrastructure indicator:
• Access to health infrastructure
• Access to education infrastructure
• Access to arts and cultural infrastructure
• Access to community and sport infrastructure
The four indicators will be produced for Australia's 21 largest cities, as well as Western Sydney. The geographic definitions of these cities will match the definitions in the NCPF dashboard. Capital cities will be defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Greater
Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSAs) and the 13 other major cities will be defined by the ABS Significant Urban Areas (SUAs). Western Sydney will be defined by the following eight LGAs: Fairfield (C), Blue Mountains (C), Camden (C), Campbelltown (C) (NSW);
Hawkesbury (C), Liverpool (C), Penrith (C) and Wollondilly (A). The indicators will be constructed in units that can be easily understood by non-technical audiences (such as percentages or index values).
In addition to producing the city-level indicator values, the RMIT Centre for Urban Research will work with BITRE to develop short descriptions of the methodologies underlying the construction of the indicators. These descriptions will be published in the NCPF dashboard data dictionary.
The RMIT Centre for Urban Research and BITRE will also work together to investigate any unusual data values and develop explanations. "
"Diversity of dinoflagellate assemblages in coastal temperate and offshore tropical waters of Australia Cyst (Resting Stage); Peridiniales; Alexandrium Minutum Background: Dinoflagellates are a ubiquitous and ecologically important component of marine phytoplankton communities, with particularly notable species including those associated with harmful algal blooms (HABs) and those that bioluminesce. High-throughput sequencing offers a novel approach compared to traditional microscopy for determining species assemblages and distributions of dinoflagellates, which are poorly known especially in Australian waters. Results: We assessed the composition of dinoflagellate assemblages in two Australian locations: coastal temperate Port Phillip Bay and offshore tropical waters of Davies Reef (Great Barrier Reef). These locations differ in certain environmental parameters reflecting latitude as well as possible anthropogenic influences. Molecular taxonomic assessment revealed more species than traditional microscopy, and it showed statistically significant differences in dinoflagellate assemblages between locations. Bioluminescent species and known associates of HABs were present at both sites. Dinoflagellates in both areas were mainly represented by the order Gymnodiniales (66%â€”82% of total sequence reads). In the warm waters of Davies Reef, Gymnodiniales were equally represented by the two superclades, Gymnodiniales sensu stricto (33%) and Gyrodinium (34%). In contrast, in cooler waters of Port Phillip Bay, Gymnodiniales was mainly represented by Gyrodinium (82%). In both locations, bioluminescent dinoflagellates represented up to 0.24% of the total sequence reads, with Protoperidinium the most abundant genus. HAB-related species, mainly represented by Gyrodinium, were more abundant in Port Phillip Bay (up to 47%) than at Davies Reef (28%), potentially reflecting anthropogenic influence from highly populated and industrial areas surrounding the bay. The entire assemblage of dinoflagellates, as well as the subsets of HAB and bioluminescent species, were strongly correlated with water quality parameters (R2 = 0.56â€“0.92). Significant predictors differed between the subsets: HAB assemblages were explained by salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and total dissolved solids; whereas, bioluminescent assemblages were explained only by salinity and dissolved oxygen, and had greater variability. Conclusion: High-throughput sequencing and genotyping revealed greater diversity of dinoflagellate assemblages than previously known in both subtropical and temperate Australian waters. Significant correlations of assemblage structure with environmental variables suggest the potential for explaining the distribution and composition of both HAB species and bioluminescent species."

"Factors influencing the concentration of fecal coliforms in oysters in the river Blackwater Estuary, UK Bacteroidales; Seashore; Fecal Bacterium Contamination of water systems can not only entail high risks to human health but can also result in economic losses due to closure of beaches and shellfish harvesting areas. Understanding the origin of fecal pollution at locations where shellfish are grown is essential in assessing associated health risks-as well as the determining actions necessary to remedy the problem. The aim of this work is to identify the species-specific source(s) of fecal contamination impacting waters overlying the shellfisheries in the Blackwater Estuary, East Anglia, UK. Over a twelve-month period, water samples were taken from above the oysters and from a variety of upstream points considered to be likely sources of fecal microorganism, together with oyster samples, and the number of fecal streptococci and E. coli were determined. Transition from low to high tide significantly decreased the concentration of fecal streptococci in waters overlying the oyster beds, indicative of a freshwater input of fecal pollution in oyster bed waters. In 12 months, the number of E. coli remained constant throughout, while fecal streptococci numbers were generally higher in the winter months. Analyses of upstream samples identified a sewage outfall to be the main source of E. coli to the oyster beds, with additional fecal streptococci from agricultural sources. The findings may assist in developing approaches for assessing the risks to shellfishery industries of various fecal inputs into an estuary, which could then help local governmental authorities address the problem."

"Inquiry into social impact investment for housing and homelessness outcomes Housing Supply; Suburban Area; Brisbane Project context Australia faces numerous and complex housing and homelessness challenges. The waiting lists for social housing are long and a significant proportion of the social housing stock is no longer fit-for-purpose (194,600 households are on social housing waiting lists (AIHW 2017a)), large proportions of the population are in housing stress because of the unaffordability of housing (between 2001 and 2016, median annual rent increased by 130% and median mortgage repayments by 102%, compared to an 82% increase in median household income (Centre for Social Impact, forthcoming)) and too many people are experiencing homelessness (approximately 1 in 200 people are homeless each night (Centre for Social Impact, forthcoming) and homelessness increased by approximately 14% between 2011 and 2016 (ABS, 2018)). New and scalable solutions are needed, but governments are increasingly fiscally constrained. Long-term trends such as an ageing population will likely exacerbate these fiscal challenges in the future (The Treasury 2015). Further, despite significant investment by governments (and philanthropists), some social policy areas' social outcomes are not markedly improving (Reeve, Marjolin et al. 2016). New solutions and scaled existing effective solutions with the right financial resources are required. Social impact investment (SII) may offer part of the solution. SII is investment intending to generate social and financial returns, while actively measuring both (SIIT 2014; GIIN 2016), and it is a growing mechanism for using capital from investors to finance solutions to complex social problems. There is significant interest in using SII to address problems in social and affordable housing and homelessness in Australia. It potentially provides government with additional policy tools and a promising framework to design and fund more effective solutions to complex social problems, including housing and homelessness, and attract other forms of capital to co-invest alongside it. However, further evidence is required on whether, how, and under what conditions, SII might work in addressing housing and homelessness issues, especially in the Australian fiscal and policy context. This Inquiry aimed to begin to further develop this evidence base. The study This is the final report for the AHURI Inquiry into social impact investment for housing and homelessness outcomes. This report provides an analysis of the overall insights from across the Inquiry's three projects.1 These insights were gathered from a critical analysis of 158 publications, a workshop with 32 expert diverse stakeholders, in-depth interviews with 70 key stakeholders, an online survey with 72 people across the financial, housing and SII sectors, and 3 case studies. Guided by the Inquiry's focus and research questions, this report has been written for a reasonably informed audience of current and potential SII actors, but with the aim of making the information accessible to a broader audience than the underlying project reports. Key Inquiry findings â€¢ SII is an investment that targets a social (or environmental) objective. SIIs can be defined as having four components: 1 Intentionality-it intends to achieve social objectives 2 Return expectations-it expects a financial and a social return 3 Measurement-the social impact can be and is measured 4 Additionality-the outcome from the investment is beyond what would have been achieved without the investment. SII is relatively new, not well understood, and there is not a shared understanding of its definition or when and how it occurs and might be applied. This finding underscores the need to develop and use shared and clear explanations for the core definitional elements of SII when developing policy and/or designing and implementing SII solutions to promote the best possible outcomes."
"Magnetic nanocomposites for sustainable water purification—a comprehensive review Biosorbents; Congo Red; Adsorption Numerous contaminants in huge amounts are discharged to the environment from various anthropogenic activities. Waterbodies are one of the major receivers of these contaminants. The contaminated water can pose serious threats to humans and animals, by distrubing the ecosystem. In treating the contaminated water, adsorption processes have attained significant maturity due to lower cost, easy operation and environmental friendliness. The adsorption process uses various adsorbent materials and some of emerging adsorbent materials include carbon- and polymer-based magnetic nanocomposites. These hybrid magnetic nanocomposites have attained extensive applications in water treatment technologies due to their magnetic properties as well as combination of unique characteristics of organic and inorganic elements. Carbon- and polymer-related magnetic nanocomposites are more adapted materials for the removal of various kinds of contaminants from waterbodies. These nanocomposites can be produced via different approaches such as filling, pulse-laser irradiation, ball milling, and electro-spinning. This comprehensive review is compiled by reviewing published work of last the latest recent 3 years. The review article extensively focuses on different approaches for producing various carbon- and polymer-based magnetic nanocomposites, their merits and demerits and applications for sustainable water purification. More specifically, use of carbon- and polymer-based magnetic nanocomposites for removal of heavy metal ions and dyes is discussed in detail, critically analyzed and compared with other technologies. In addition, commercial viability in terms of regeneration of adsorbents is also reviewed. Furthermore, the future challenges and prospects in employing magnetic nanocomposites for contaminant removal from various water sources are presented."
"Exploring the potential for planning support systems to bridge the research-translation gap between public health and urban planning Planning; GIS; Cartography Background: There is consensus that planning professionals need clearer guidance on the features that are likely to produce optimal community-wide health benefits. However, much of this evidence resides in academic literature and not in tools accessible to the diverse group of professionals shaping our cities. Incorporating health-related metrics into the planning support systems (PSS) provides an opportunity to apply empirical evidence on built environment relationships with health-related outcomes to inform real-world land use and transportation planning decisions. This paper explores the role of planning support systems (PSS) to facilitate the translation and application of health evidence into urban planning and design practices to create healthy, liveable communities. Methods: A review of PSS software and a literature review of studies featuring a PSS modelling built environmental features and health impact assessment for designing and creating healthy urban areas was undertaken. Customising existing software, a health impact PSS (the Urban Health Check) was then piloted with a real-world planning application to evaluate the usefulness and benefits of a health impact PSS for demonstrating and communicating potential health impacts of design scenarios in planning practice. Results: Eleven PSS software applications were identified, of which three were identified as having the capability to undertake health impact analyses. Three studies met the inclusion criteria of presenting a planning support system customised to support health impact assessment with health impacts modelled or estimated due to changes to the built environment. Evaluation results indicated the Urban Health Check PSS helped in four key areas: visualisation of how the neighbourhood would change in response to a proposed plan; understanding how a plan could benefit the community; Communicate and improve understanding health of planning and design decisions that positively impact health outcomes. Conclusions: The use of health-impact PSS have the potential to be transformative for the translation and application of health evidence into planning policy and practice, providing those responsible for the policy and practice of designing and creating our communities with access to quantifiable, evidence-based information about how their decisions might impact community health."
"Labour and regional transition: sex-segregation, the absence of gender and the valorisation of masculinised employment in Gippsland, Australia Gender Mainstreaming; Feminism; European Union This paper explores the place of gender in relation to labour and transition in regional development. A â€˜gendered lensâ€™ is applied to planning documents relating to the region of Gippsland, Australia. While previous research highlights the importance of accounting for gender in regional development, gendered analyses outside Europe are scarce. We argue that an apparent gender neutrality in planning documents in effect privileges masculinised elements of the economy. It means that current approaches to regional development, at best, reproduce the gendered status quo and, at worst, further re-entrench gender inequality in the region, with consequences for regional labour policy. Our findings have flow on effects for gender relations, and specifically for women, and economic policy in regions undergoing transition in Gippsland. We conclude that any regional policy that does not account for gendered realities and the lived experiences of women, ultimately fails the region."
"How do computer scientists use google scholar?: A survey of user interest in elements on SERPs and author profile pages Web Search; Information Retrieval; Learning to Rank In this paper, we explore user interest in elements on Google Scholarâ€™s search engine result pages (SERPs) and author profile pages (APPs) through a survey in order to predict search behavior. We investigate the effects of different query intents (keyword and title) on SERPs and research area familiarities (familiar and less-familiar) on SERPs and APPs. Our findings show that user interest is affected by the respondentsâ€™ research area familiarity, whereas there is no effect due to the different query intents, and that users tend to distribute different levels of interest to elements on SERPs and APPs. We believe that this study provides the basis for understanding search behavior in using Google Scholar."

"MOF-derived ceria-zirconia supported Co3O4 catalysts with enhanced activity in CO2 methanation Methane Production; Catalyst; Synthesis Gas Recent research in catalyst development for CO2 methanation has been focussing on the design of nanostructures with high porosity and better redox properties. Herein, nanostructured Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 mixed oxide support was prepared by a metal organic framework (MOF)-template approach and its properties were well compared with a similar catalyst prepared by a conventional coprecipitation (CP) method. The MOF-template approach resulted in the production of a nanoporous Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 support with improved redox properties compared to the coprecipitated Ce0.8Zr0.2O2. The prepared support was then decorated with Co3O4 nanoparticles and tested in CO2 methanation reaction. At 320 Â°C, 1.5 MPa and GHSV = 15,000 mL gË—1 hË—1, the Co/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst prepared by MOF-template method achieved far better CO2 conversion (81.2%) and improved CH4 selectivity (99%) than the catalyst prepared by CP method (48.7% CO2 conversion and 97% CH4 selectivity). The long-time presence of the MOF-derived Co/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 catalyst on the stream proved its resistance towards sintering, which may be ascribed to the fine dispersion of Co3O4 nanoparticles as well as their excellent integration in the network of nanoporous Ce0.8Zr0.2O2."

"Application of high-frequency ultrasound standing waves for the recovery of lipids from high-fat dairy effluent Acoustic Levitation; Acoustics; Bessel Beam Effect of high-frequency ultrasonication was examined on wastewater of a cheese manufacturing plant. Tests were carried out at two frequencies (500 kHz and 1 MHz) and two temperatures (22 and 40 Â°C). Samples were subjected to different energy densities; 7.5, 30.2, 60.5 and 121.0 J/mL at 500 kHz and 7.9, 31.7, 63.4 and 126.8 J/mL at 1 MHz to observe the creaming and recovery of lipid. These energy densities correspond to 30, 120, 240 and 480 s of sonication. Sonication was performed using a single plate transducer and reflector system at 40 W to create standing wave to coalesce and flocculate lipid globules. Recovery was higher at 40 Â°C after 480 s of sonication at both frequencies (77% at 500 kHz and 75% at 1 MHz). The lowest recovery of 47% was observed at 500 kHz and 22 Â°C at all applied energy densities. Changes in particle size and turbidity in the bottom aliquot indicated that high-frequency ultrasound caused coagulation and aggregation and settling of colloidal particles. Increase in particle size was observed to be highest at 1 MHz, 40 Â°C and 480 s of sonication. These results confirm that high-frequency ultrasound standing wave technology can be used to recover lipid from high-lipid dairy wastewater including that from cheese manufacturing."
"Nitrogen contamination and bioremediation in groundwater and the environment: A review Nitrate Pollution; Denitrification; Isotopes Nitrogen contamination of groundwater and the environment is an increasing problem in today's society. Since the invention of the Haber-Bosh process in 1913, the impacts of N on human health and the environment have become increasingly widespread due to the industrial scale production of reactive N (Nr). As a result, government organisations and the scientific community continue to make advances towards tackling this ongoing problem. The inherent difficulties of accessing, observing and monitoring groundwater, combined with the complexity of interactions between groundwater chemistry, hydrogeology and ecology have resulted in gaps in fundamental knowledge, specifically regarding the understanding and remediation of N contaminated groundwater. As these knowledge gaps are addressed with ongoing research, current and future remediation targets are being consistently updated; this has resulted in past remediation strategies that may no longer be consistent in meeting new regulatory guidelines for water quality. As such, the search for more technically and economically feasible remediation strategies continues. Recent advances in bioremediation technologies have opened up promising avenues for research in the remediation of N contaminated groundwater. This literature review outlines the past, present and future of Nr-contamination and remediation in Nr -contaminated groundwater within the broader context of the larger environment. The literature cited in this review is critically evaluated to determine significant knowledge gaps."

"The impact of state regulation in a sphere of education on sustainable development of national economy Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Education is a core element of the Sustainable Development Concept. It is not only because of the declaration of SDG 4 within the 2030 Agenda but also its embeddedness in other goals, targets, and indicators. Thus, the study aims to generalize approaches to define the relationship between the efficiency of the strategy of sustainable development of the national economy and state regulation of education. The research is accomplished for 14 Central and Eastern European countries (2006-2016) using the combination of principal components method and parametric method of stochastic frontier analysis in the software package STATA 11 and FRONTIER 4.1. As a result, the empirical proofs of the strong and adequate link between the efficiency of the sustainable development strategy of the national economy and state regulation of education are identified. The technical efficiency indexes were also calculated that allowed forming three clusters for Central and Eastern European countries distributed by the level of state regulation of education and efficiency of sustainable development strategy implementation. It helps to distinguish the main measures to reform the state regulation of education in Ukraine considering the experience of Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic, countries that proved to be the leaders in a sphere of sustainable development strategy implementation. The recommendations for further improvements in educational policies were defined. For instance, effective and sustainable state regulation of education should focus on decentralizing education, developing private-public partnerships, stimulating adult education development, etc."
"Computational fluid dynamics comparison of impaired breathing function in French bulldogs with nostril stenosis and an examination of the efficacy of rhinoplasty Tracheoscopy; Craniosynostoses; French Bulldog Background: Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) in dogs indicates a particular set of upper airway abnormalities found in brachycephalic dogs (e.g., French bulldogs). Stenotic nares is one of the primary BOAS-related abnormalities restricting the functional breathing of affected dogs. For severe stenosis, rhinoplasty is required to increase the accessibility of the external nostril to air; however, the specific improvement from surgery in terms of respiratory physiology and uptake of inhaled air has not been fully elucidated Method: This study employed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to evaluate the effects of different stenotic intensities on airflow patterns in a total of eight French bulldog upper airways. A bulldog with severe stenosis after surgery was included to examine the efficacy of the surgical intervention. Results: The results showed homogeneous airflow distributions in healthy and mild stenosis cases and significantly accelerated airstreams at the constricted positions in moderate and severe stenosis bulldogs. The airflow resistance was over 20-fold greater in severe stenosis cases than the healthy cases. After surgery, a decrease in airflow velocity was observed in the surgical region, and the percentage of reduced airflow resistance was approximately 4%. Conclusions: This study suggests impaired breathing function in brachycephalic dogs with moderate and severe stenosis. The results also serve as a reference for veterinarians in surgical planning and monitoring bulldogs' recuperation after surgery."
"Prediction of Field-Scale Wheat Yield Using Machine Learning Method and Multi-Spectral UAV Data Crops; Leaf Area Index; Hyperspectral Data Accurate prediction of food crop yield is of great significance for global food security and regional trade stability. Since remote sensing data collected from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms have the features of flexibility and high resolution, these data can be used as samples to develop regional regression models for accurate prediction of crop yield at a field scale. The primary objective of this study was to construct regional prediction models for winter wheat yield based on multi-spectral UAV data and machine learning methods. Six machine learning methods including Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) were used for the construction of the yield prediction models. Ten vegetation indices (VIs) extracted from canopy spectral images of winter wheat acquired from a multi-spectral UAV at five key growth stages in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, China in 2021 were selected as the variables of the models. In addition, in situ measurements of wheat yield were obtained in a destructive sampling manner for prediction algorithm modeling and validation. Prediction results of single growth stages showed that the optimal model was GPR constructed from extremely strong correlated VIs (ESCVIs) at the filling stage (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 49.22 g/m2, MAE = 42.74 g/m2). The results of multiple stages showed GPR achieved the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 49.18 g/m2, MAE = 42.57 g/m2) when the ESCVIs of the flowering and filling stages were used. Larger sampling plots were adopted to verify the accuracy of yield prediction; the results indicated that the GPR model has strong adaptability at different scales. These findings suggest that using machine learning methods and multi-spectral UAV data can accurately predict crop yield at the field scale and deliver a valuable application reference for farm-scale field crop management."
"Optimizing the energy consumption in a residential building at different climate zones: Towards sustainable decision making Walls (Structural Partitions); Hot Temperature; Insulation Electricity dependent heating-cooling (H/C) system has increased rapidly to provide thermal comfort to the occupants. H/C is a major source of energy consumption in residential buildings around the world. Studies revealed that the thermal properties of building materials are converted into the same unit as thermal resistance (R) in the USA, Canada, The UK, Australia, and other countries. However, none of the previous studies have considered the adaptation of national insulation codes to reduce electricity cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the correlations of energy consumption (Q) to thermal resistances (R) of the building envelop (A). Therefore, this study attempts to review the optimum energy consumption of a selected house due to H/C at different choices of national code standardized R values. Accurate envelop areas (A) of the selected house components are estimated by applying the Autodesk Revit Building Information Model (BIM) to use in the energy model. The case study critically evaluates the variation of electricity cost, GHG emissions, and selection of the optimized thermostat settings for energy savings in different climatic regions and seasons of a year. Different correlations are obtained using risk analysis software on energy consumptions with code recognized arrays of insulations. This sensitivity analysis result shows that the corelation coefficient of energy consumption with medium-low insulated building envelop (r = 0.44) is more significant than improved, maximum, medium-high, and minimum insulations (r = 0.14â€“0.29) which indicates the insulation range where more emphasis should be put to get an optimized solution. Thus the developed analytical framework supports inclusive decision-making by selecting appropriate kinds of insulation for the design of a sustainable house."
"The ambivalent role of institutions in the CO2 emissions: The case of emerging countries Environmental Kuznets Curve; China; Trade Openness The CO2 emission is a very urgent theme for emerging economies that are currently producing 60% of the global emissions. Because these countries generally have a high economic growth, they usually face with environmental issues. This article investigates the relationship between the economic activity, and more precisely economic integration (trade openness and FDI inflow), on CO2 emissions by taking into consideration the potential role played by institutions. Through sys-GMM estimators, our analysis investigates a sample of 36 emerging economies on a period going from 2002 to 2015. Our major findings are the following: (1) The economic integration increases CO2 emissions, supporting the â€œpollution-havenâ€ hypothesis for emerging economies; (2) the improvement of institutional quality also increases CO2 emissions via the increase of economic activities it generates; (3) more interestingly, the improvements of institutions can reduce the positive effect of FDI inflow and trade openness on CO2 emissions. We will explain this observation through the lens of the well-known Environmental Kuznets curve suggesting that an improvement of institutional quality goes hand in hand with financial and trade openness of emerging economies if these countries want to fight against global warming in the long term."
"What Drives Petrol Price Dispersion across Australian Cities? Price Dynamics; Price Dispersion; Asymmetric Pricing Petrol directly impacts the ability of and extent to which households can engage in day-to-day activities and ultimately directly influences the aggregate economic activity. Petrol price increases can lead to major economic disruption, especially among the most vulnerable, such as low-income families. In Australia, petrol prices differ substantially between metropolitan and regional areas, and regional drivers must pay more for purchasing petrol than those in capital cities. This research explored why retail petrol prices vary from one city to another within and between Australian regions. In this study, clustering methods and panel models will be used to identify factors that cause price differences. The findings revealed that a considerable part of the price differences arose from specific characteristics of cities that influence the demand and supply of petrol, thereby causing variations in price decisions. Petrol prices were substantially influenced by wholesale petrol prices, oil prices, petrol and diesel vehicles, population density, station density, and public transport accessibility. These factors are the main determinants that contribute significantly to price variations between Australian cities. The findings provide critical information for economic agents that interact in this market. From a social welfare perspective, government authorities can consider these factors to improve living standards and consumersâ€™ welfare under price pressure in regional cities."
"Bamboo as an alternative bioenergy crop and powerful ally for land restoration in Indonesia Culms; Phyllostachys Edulis; Plantation The energy demand in Indonesia has increased significantly with its population growth, urbanization, and economic development. The growing concern of meeting energy demand while reducing dependency on fossil fuels has resulted in an increasing demand for renewable energy. As a country with a rich biomass base, bioenergy is now an important component of Indonesia's energy agenda. However, a crucial problem in bioenergy production is the selection of species that can provide a sustainable supply of feedstock without having an impact on food security and the environment. In this context, we discuss the characteristics and benefits of using bamboo, a perennial grass, as a potential species for bioenergy feedstock in Indonesia. We describe the fuel characteristics of bamboo along with the possibility to align its cultivation, production, and usage with environmental and developmental agendas which makes it a suitable bioenergy crop in the country. In addition, its ability to grow on degraded lands, fast growth, long root system, and easy maintenance prove it as a powerful ally for the restoration of degraded land. We recommend in-depth research on the social, ecological, and economic feasibility of using this species for bioenergy production."
"Are exports more responsive to clean or dirty energy? The case of Vietnam's exports to 54 countries Consumption Growth; Renewable Energy Consumption; Economic Growth In this paper we examine the influence of clean (hydropower) or dirty (fossil fuel generated) energy on bilateral exports. We focus on bilateral exports from Vietnam, a developing nation with a fast-growing economy propelled by international trade, to her top 54 trading partners over the period 1986-2010. Our key results suggest that there is a significant, positive, and stable long-term relationship between electricity and exports, with some variations across the regional panels of the trading partners and electricity sources. Trading partners of Vietnam are sensitive to how electricity is generated. For trading partners from regions excluding low income Asia, bilateral exports respond more to renewables than fossil fuel generated electricity, which indicates that exports are sensitive to certain qualities of energy sources, namely reliability and price competitiveness."
"Development of SiO2-coumarin fluorescent nanohybrid and its application for Cu(II) sensing in aqueous extracts of roadside soil Fluorescence; Rhodamines; Cupric Ion A SiO2-coumarin nanohybrid was investigated for its Cu(II) sensing performance in aqueous media, and in comparison with the Cu(II)-selective coumarin used alone. Fluorescence of both coumarin itself and the nanohybrid, Î»ex/Î»em 435/481 nm, was selectively quenched by Cu(II) when tested against a range of multivalent cations. The nanohybrid had enhanced Cu(II) sensing properties when compared to the coumarin including (i) improved limit of detection from Î¼M-level (0.48 Î¼M) of Cu(II) using coumarin alone to nM-level (0.033 Î¼M) and (ii) an extended linear detection range of 0.033â€“260 Î¼M (0.0005â€“4.1 mg/mL) Cu(II) compared to 0.48â€“55 Î¼M for the coumarin itself. The lower limit of detection and extended range were achieved with a smaller amount of coumarin and no traces of organic solvents used to help coumarin dissolution. Characterization suggested that under applied test conditions at pH = 5, SiO2 nanoparticles with negative surface charges adsorbed coumarin and then (when present) Cu(II) ions. The SiO2-coumarin nanohybrid was then applied for the determination of Cu(II) levels in aqueous soil extracts reaching over 94% recovery rates when used against the standard soil analysis method by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

"Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Analytics on Medical Time Series Data Network Protocol; Secure Multi-Party Computation; Privacy Preserving Medical time series data analytics based on dynamic time warping (DTW) greatly benefits modern medical research. Driven by the distributed nature of medical data, the collaboration of multiple healthcare institutions is usually necessary for a sound medical conclusion. Among others, a typical use case is disease screening for public health, where multiple healthcare institutions wish to collaboratively detect over their joint datasets the patients whose medical records have similar features to the given query samples. However, sharing the medical data faces critical privacy obstacles with the increasingly strict legal regulations on data privacy. In this article, we present the design of a novel system enabling privacy-preserving DTW-based analytics on distributed medical time series datasets. Our system is built from a delicate synergy of techniques from both cryptography and data mining domains, where the key idea is to leverage observations on the advancements in plaintext DTW analytics (e.g., clustering and pruning) to facilitate the scalable computation in the ciphertext domain, through our tailored security design. Extensive experiments over real medical time series datasets demonstrate the promising performance of our system, e.g., our system is able to process a secure DTW query computation over 15K time series sequences in 34 minutes."
"Preparation and Characterization of a Novel Amidoxime-Modified Polyacrylonitrile/Fly Ash Composite Adsorbent and Its Application to Metal Wastewater Treatment Aqueous Solution; Biosorption; Second-Order Model The polyacrylonitrile/fly ash composite was synthesized through solution polymerization and was modified with NH2 OHÂ·HCl. The amidoxime-modified polyacrylonitrile/fly ash composite demonstrated excellent adsorption capacity for Zn2+ in an aqueous medium. Fourier transform-Infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the prepared materials. The results showed that the resulting amidoxime-modified polyacrylonitrile/fly ash composite was able to effectively remove Zn2+ at pH 4â€“6. Adsorption of Zn2+ was hindered by the coexisting cations. The adsorption kinetics of Zn2+ by Zn2+ followed the pseudo-second order kinetic model. The adsorption process also satisfactorily fit the Langmuir model, and the adsorption process was mainly single layer. The Gibbs free energy âˆ†G0, âˆ†H0, and âˆ†S0 were negative, indicating the adsorption was a spontaneous, exothermic, and high degree of order in solution system."
"Unravelling soil carbon response to warming in fire-affected ecosystems (ext led by Griffith University) This project aims to reveal the Australian and global patterns of soil carbon (C) response to warming in fireaffected ecosystems and to unravel the biogeochemical mechanisms underlying fire’s role in shaping the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. Fire has modified over 40% of the Earth’s land surface and wildfire frequency is predicted to increase under global warming. This project expects to generate new knowledge on how fire influences soil-to-atmosphere C fluxes in a warmer climate using global and multi-disciplinary approaches. Expected outcomes include an enhanced capacity to predict the terrestrial ecosystem-to-atmosphere C fluxes and
their feedbacks to climate under increasing frequency of fire using Earth-system models."

"Criminal record checking and employment: The importance of policy and proximity Criminal Record; Hiring Decisions; Applicant Employment is essential to the rehabilitation of offenders, yet employers routinely check criminal records and rely on them to deny offenders employment. To manage these practices many jurisdictions use spent conviction and anti-discrimination schemes; there have also been recent campaigns aimed at â€˜banning the boxâ€™, requiring that questions about criminal record are deferred to a later point when the person could address them in interview. This article draws on findings from surveys and interviews with human resources personnel about their criminal record checking practices to identify some key concerns of employers and highlight areas for challenging employer practices. The study highlights the influence on employment decisions of external factors â€“ legislation, government policy and industry regulation â€“ and of internal considerations about proximity of the decision maker to the applicant and potential proximity to other staff. The willingness of some employers to engage with applicants opens up the possibilities for people with a criminal record to demonstrate their readiness to desist from offending and to counter stereotypes about offenders. Where there is no scope for, or willingness to attempt, such discretionary engagement, however, it is likely that employers will prioritize a risk-averse approach to employment, pre-emptively excluding potentially productive employees, and putting such ex-offenders at risk of deeper exclusion."

"Sustainable developments and corporate social responsibility in Vietnamese fashion enterprises Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate the status of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility in fashion enterprises in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is qualitative in nature and utilized a multiple case study approach (questionnaires and face-to-face interviews) to achieve the objectives of the research. NVivo was used to analyze the data. Findings: Findings showed that by collaborating with the local artisans to create the unique clothing lines, the fashion brands try to blend and upscale the traditional indigenous clothing styles with modern design concepts to promote the diversity of Vietnamese ethnic culture. The findings also suggest that both the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large enterprises (LEs) should maintain their corporate social responsibility (CSR) concepts to comply with the legal obligations such as salary and welfare benefits for employees, work safety, gender equality and promotions. Further, the CSR activities should address the social issues with their target stakeholders, particularly with the local communities. Originality/value: This study sought to provide a snapshot on the current sustainable practices followed in Vietnamese fashion enterprises."

"Are public open space attributes associated with walking and depression? Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Public open spaces (POS) are key neighbourhood destinations shown to confer numerous physical and mental health benefits. The amount and spatial distribution of POS throughout cities are guided by urban planning policies and standards. However, empirical evidence is not generally used to create POS standards. Developing and testing POS indices associated with positive health outcomes, can inform evidence-based POS urban design and planning standards that support the creation of healthier cities. This study examined associations of urban design policy-derived and empirical measures of POS proximity and density with walking and depression. The 2011â€“12 Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle study (AusDiab) wave data were used. Adults living in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia were included (n = 319). Participants reported walking for recreation and any walking within their neighbourhood during the last week. Depression was calculated using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CESD-10). Informed by Australian urban design policies and empirical evidence, various POS measures were calculated at different street network distances around residential addresses using geographic information systems software. Measures tested included: distance to nearest POS, size of nearest POS, total number of POS, and area of POS at scales of 400, 800, 1000, and 1600 m. Associations of these POS measures with walking and depression were examined using adjusted multilevel logistic regression models. Overall 68% and 77% of participants reported walking for recreation and any walking in the past week, respectively; and about 13% were categorized as depressed. Living within 400 m of POS was not associated with either type of walking, but those whose nearest POS was > 1.5 ha had 1.90 and 2.66 times greater odds of walking for recreation and any walking during the last week, respectively. In Melbourne, the urban design policy standard is that POS be available within 400 m of homes. In our study, this standard was not associated with walking or depression; however having a larger POS nearby supported residentsâ€™ walking. This study highlights the importance of assessing such standards for their potential health impact, and warrants further investigation."

"3D characterization of defects in deep-powder-bed manufactured Ti–6Al–4V and their influence on tensile properties Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Deep-powder-bed additive manufacturing (AM) can lead to distinctive microstructural features. In this study, 300-mm long cylindrical rods (12-mm diameter) of Tiâ€“6Alâ€“4V were vertically built to the limit height of a commercial selective electron beam melting (SEBM) system for quantitative three-dimensional (3D) characterization of the defects by X-ray micro-computed tomography (Î¼-CT). Detailed Î¼-CT data from 18,337 consecutive slices revealed a strong dependence of defect characteristics on build height, including defect volume, population, sphericity, major axis length, depth and orientation angle. The first 100-mm build exhibited the worst presence of defects by each measurement, while the middle and last 100-mm builds contained much fewer defects, especially the last 100-mm build, which was free of lack-of-fusion defects (sphericity < 0.5). As a result, the first 100-mm build displayed 50% lower reduction of area and 20% lower strain-to-fracture than the last 100-mm build, while the tensile strengths varied within just Â±3%. An outer 3-mm thick ring and a central 1.5-mm diameter region were found to contain substantially less defects along the 300-mm build height. The dependence of defect features on build height was attributed to the existence of an upward temperature gradient during SEBM. The 3D defect features revealed by Î¼-CT along the build height provide important implications for deep-powder-bed AM by SEBM."
"Experimental and numerical studies on the thermal performance of ground heat exchangers in a layered subsurface with groundwater Geothermal Heat Pumps; Heat Exchangers; Boreholes Thermal performance of the ground source heat pump (GSHP) system can be significantly affected by the complex geological substructures (such as ground stratification and groundwater advection). This study installed a seepage box inside the two-layered laboratory device to investigate the heat transfer processes of the unsaturated, saturated and infiltrated ground. Various operational and geological conditions were designed to study the temperature distributions at various locations and time experimentally and numerically. The groundwater effect on ground heat exchanger (GHE) thermal performance depends on the thermal properties, flow advection and the relationship between temperatures of the groundwater and ground. If the ground was partially saturated during the heat injection period, the cooling seepage will efficiently remove the heat of GHEs in upper-stream rather than those located in the bottom-stream. Meanwhile, the heat transfer can be enhanced if two legs of the U-tube vertical to the direction of groundwater seepage. The groundwater flow can redistribute the heat within the ground and showed a better recovery performance which advance an even temperature distribution by 3 h. The temperature and carried heat load of the cooler groundwater will increase during the heat injection experiment, and further contributed to various temperature distributions of ground at different locations and time."
"Analytics for awareness in maritime surveillance: from data to tactical insight Safety; Awareness; Accident Investigation Although significant effort has occurred into developing realistic simulation environments for maritime surveillance, relatively little attention has been given to objectively summarizing and providing platforms for querying the mission simulation outputs for post-mission debriefing purposes. In this paper we adopt recently proposed data analytic ideas for this context and illustrate the proposed approach using multi-layered statistical methods from visualization to Bayesian network-based data interpretation models. Analyzing example missions in these terms demonstrates the potential use for such technologies for objective and insightful post-mission analyses."

"Child labour and social exclusion A trade-theoretic analysis Child Labor; Family Characteristic; School Attendance A four-good, four-factor general equilibrium trade-theoretic model is utilised that incorporates social exclusion, consumption disaggregation and child labour. In this framework, trickle-down economics fails and under very plausible conditions, socially excluded families and their children are impoverished by capital accumulation. Policies such as a ban on child labour have differential effects on the economy. Specifically, a ban on child labour in the traded goods sector necessarily improves the welfare of the socially excluded families and their children. However, a ban on child labour in the non-traded goods sector has ambiguous implications for the welfare of the excluded group. Thus, this paper highlights the importance of disaggregation and social exclusion for policymaking."

"A comparative method of air emission impact assessment for building construction activities Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Different construction activities may indicate distinct environmental impacts due to their uniqueness. Ability to assess and compare the environmental impacts from different construction activities can aid the process of minimising emissions at different building construction processes. The study presents a comparative impact assessment methodology to evaluate environmental impacts at different activities during the building construction stage. Significant impact related construction activities for five major impact categories namely global warming potential (GWP 100), acidification potential (AP), Eutrophication potential (EP), Photochemical oxidation formation potential (POFP) and Human toxicity potential (HTP) are compared from the global, regional and local perspectives. A case study of a residential building in Australia is used to demonstrate the application of the functions of the developed method. The results of the case study indicated that the method can be effectively used to compare environmental impacts of different construction activities at different geographical perspectives considered. The method can be used by designers and contractors in comparing impacts of various construction activities to identify the most emission effective construction processes."

"The relationship between fire and weeds in Victorian grasslands: A case study of Terrick Terrick National Park (PhD student: Isabelle Hally) Prescribed burns are often recommended for controlling exotic weeds, but in some cases, fire is known to facilitate weed invasion. The aim of this project is to understand when prescribed burns can successfully suppress weed invasion and facilitate native vegetation recovery. We will combine field surveys of native and exotic plant communities pre- and post-fire, measurements of environmental variables including soil microbial community sampling, and experimental removal of invasive weeds, to understand the mechanisms in which fire constrains or facilitates plant invasion. This project will inform future management of exotic weeds in fire-prone environments."
"Detection of helminth ova in wastewater using recombinase polymerase amplification coupled to lateral flow strips Schistosomiasis Haematobia; Helminthiasis; Period Prevalence Ascaris lumbricoides is a major soil-transmitted helminth that is highly infective to humans. The ova of A. lumbricoides are able to survive wastewater treatment, thus making it an indicator organism for effective water treatment and sanitation. Hence, Ascaris ova must be removed from wastewater matrices for the safe use of recycled water. Current microscopic techniques for identification and enumeration of Ascaris ova are laborious and cumbersome. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques are sensitive and specific, however, major constraints lie in having to transport samples to a centralised laboratory, the requirement for sophisticated instrumentation and skilled personnel. To address this issue, a rapid, highly specific, sensitive, and affordable method for the detection of helminth ova was developed utilising recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) coupled with lateral flow (LF) strips. In this study, Ascaris suum ova were used to demonstrate the potential use of the RPA-LF assay. The method was faster (< 30 min) with optimal temperature at 37 Â°C and greater sensitivity than PCR-based approaches with detection as low as 2 femtograms of DNA. Furthermore, ova from two different helminth genera were able to be detected as a multiplex assay using a single lateral flow strip, which could significantly reduce the time and the cost of helminth identification. The RPA-LF system represents an accurate, rapid, and cost-effective technology that could replace the existing detection methods, which are technically challenged and not ideal for on-site detection in wastewater treatment plants."

"Conditional altruism: Effects of HRM practices on the willingness of host-country nationals to help expatriates Self-initiated Expatriates; International Assignments; Expatriates The assistance of host-country nationals (HCNs) both within the workplace and in the external environment plays a significant role in expatriate adjustment and work performance on international assignments. Extant research exploring antecedents of HCNs' attitudes and behaviors toward expatriates focuses on personal and intrapersonal factors but overlooks organizational contextual effects. In this study, we propose and test a model that HCNs' willingness to help expatriates is influenced by HRM practices in international subsidiaries of multinational enterprises (MNEs). Results of analyzing data collected from Chinese subsidiaries of South Korean MNEs showed that high-commitment HRM practices directly and indirectly influence HCNs' willingness to help expatriates through the mediation of perceived organizational support (POS). Socially responsible HRM indirectly influences the criterion variable through the mediation of organizational identification. Moreover, POS and organizational identification sequentially mediate the effect of high-commitment HRM on HCNs' willingness to help expatriates. These findings shed some light on organizational antecedents that go beyond personal and intrapersonal factors of HCN attitudes and behavior toward expatriates."
"Acute and chronic toxicity of magnesium to the early life stages of two tropical freshwater mussel species Freshwater Mussels; Unionidae; Bivalvia Magnesium (Mg) is a common contaminant in mine water discharges. Although Mg is an essential element in biological processes, increased concentrations from anthropogenic sources can stress aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, studies evaluating the effects of Mg on north Australian freshwater species have indicated that in very soft waters there is a high risk to some species. Freshwater mussels are an ecologically and culturally important taxon in many freshwater environments, but knowledge of their sensitivity to Mg is limited. In the present study, the acute and chronic sensitivity of two freshwater mussel species, Velesunio angasi and an undescribed Velesunio species, to Mg was assessed (using MgSO4) on their early life stages, larval glochidia and post-parasitic juveniles. Acute 24-h exposures with glochidia generated a mean median lethal (LC50) toxicity estimate of 284mg/L for the five tests with V. angasi, and a mean LC50 of 300mg/L for the three tests with Velesunio sp. Mean chronic 14-d toxicity estimates resulting in 50% (EC50) and 10% (EC10) growth rate reductions for juveniles were 241 and 88mg/L respectively for the three tests with V. angasi juveniles, and 232 and 87mg/L respectively for the three tests with Velesunio sp. juveniles. The results represent the first acute and chronic Mg toxicity data for tropical freshwater mussels, and indicated that V. angasi and Velesunio sp. exhibited similar sensitivity and were moderately sensitive to Mg when compared to other tropical species. These results are a valuable contribution to the small existing dataset for Mg toxicity to tropical freshwater species, which can be used to inform water management in areas where Mg is a contaminant of concern, and ensure the protection of these taxa."

"Caretakers' perceptions and willingness-to-pay for complementary food in urban and rural Cambodia Malnutrition; Child Nutrition Disorders; Stunting Inadequate child nutrition during the first â€˜1000 daysâ€™ is widespread in Cambodia, resulting in a high prevalence of child malnutrition. Access to processed complementary food in packages (PCFP) may support caretakers in improving diet of young children. This study aimed to evaluate the caretakers' preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for PCFP in Cambodia. The study was conducted in urban and rural settings, involving 520 caretakers with children aged 7â€“24 months in Phnom Penh (urban) and Prey Veng (rural). Four PCFPs were included: a commercial brand, a social-commercial brand, a worldwide distributed fortified complementary food aid product (CSB++) and an experimental fortified rice-and-fish-based PCFP developed in Cambodia (WF-L). Sensory analysis was conducted for all products, stated WTP was assessed for three products (excluding CSB++) and actual WTP experiment was conducted on WF-L only. Our results show that overall, WF-L was preferred by the rural participants over food aid CSB++. Further improvements in the organoleptic qualities of WF-L should focus on consistency and taste. The participants were, on average, willing to pay 1,667 Cambodian riel (KHR, $0.4) and 1,192 KHR ($0.3) in urban and rural settings, respectively, for 35 g of WF-L. We also found that despite being nutritionally inadequate, most participants considered homemade porridge to be healthier, more practical and preferred by the children. Therefore improving the quality of homemade foods merits urgent consideration. When applying PCFP in nutrition programmes as a supplementary option to homemade complementary foods, locally produced products could be a more viable supplementary option than global food aid."
"A water-based pressure casting method for transtibial prosthetic socket fit in developing countries Amputation; Lower Extremity; Prosthetic Fitting Many challenges are faced by large numbers of people with lower limb amputation in developing countries. Foremost are cost and access to skilled prosthetic services. Attempts have been made to develop socket fabrication techniques that require little or no prosthetic skill. This study investigated a water pressure casting technique (PCAST) to fabricate and fit transtibial (TT) prosthetic sockets. Ethics approval and informed consent were obtained. Fifty-three adults with unilateral TT amputation were recruited from VIETCOT (Hanoi). VIETCOT staff with ISPO category II qualifications fabricated and fitted the prostheses. Firstly, a cotton sock was placed over the residual limb followed by a plaster wrap. The participant stood with the intact limb on a weight-scale and placed the residual limb into a plastic bag-type diaphragm housed in a cylindrical tank filled with water until they stood normally with half body weight supported. Upon hardening a positive plaster model was made and a socket fabricated with a distal pelite cap. A polypropylene socket was then moulded and attached to ICRC prosthetic components and a rubber foot. The same person fabricated, fitted and aligned the prosthesis. Once a participant indicated satisfaction, the following tasks were completed: timed up-and-go (TUG), six-minute walk (6MWT), walking (GAITRite mat) and satisfaction questionnaire (SATPRO). These tasks were also completed after an extended usage period (146 Â± 28 days). Thirty-one of the participants were successfully fitted: fourteen fits failed, eight failed to return, withdrew or became deceased. SATPRO (n = 31) showed high levels of satisfaction (81%) on both test occasions. 6MWT increased by 28 m (p = 0.01) after the usage period. TUG, SATPRO and gait measures remained unchanged. A sub-analysis (n = 21) compared PCAST performance to original socket and prosthesis. No differences were found. In conclusion, the PCAST may assist people with TT amputation in developing countries."

"Sustainability and depth of outreach: Evidence from microfinance institutions in sub-Saharan Africa Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion The feasibility of microfinance institutions (MFIs) to expand outreach to the poorest while remaining financially sustainable has long been debated. Using data from 206 MFIs in 33 African countries, we adopt the three-stage least square technique to assess whether a trade-off exists between sustainability and outreach depth. Our results confirm the existence of a trade-off. The evidence also supports ongoing subsidies for MFIs with the aim of encouraging outreach. In addition, we examine whether there is an inflection point beyond which higher interest rates reduce profitability for MFIs. We find no evidence of a threshold beyond which profitability is reduced."

"Tiny houses and planning regulation for housing alternatives: the context of regional Victoria Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness The emergence of â€˜Tiny Housesâ€™ as a dwelling and cultural phenomenon reveals significant frictions with regulatory systems orientated towards orthodox housing models. In this regard the tiny house movement shares a genealogy with traditions of self-build housing and more recent sustainable and affordable housing alternatives. In each instance, regulatory frameworks have created points of resistance, including a planning system that differentiates between various categories of permanent and temporary accommodation. In regional areas such tensions are apparent in various forms; fluidity between temporary and permanent residential uses, unregulated self-building and the use of non-residential structures for housing. We position Tiny Houses as a category of these conflicts, arguing that the regulatory intent of restricting dwellings has a range of purposes in Victorian planning law, including the protection of farmland, the regulation of wastewater and the maintenance of housing standards. This paper will utilise Victorian planning decisions and definitions to consider the way in which non-conforming housing models have been addressed in rural settings and credibility given to claims of sustainability and innovation in housing provision within the broader decision-making framework. The results suggest that varied housing is enabled by the planning system, however category issues remain regarding mobility, permanence and impact."
"Effect of Long-Term Aging on Polymer Degradation and Fatigue Resistance of Hybrid Polymer-Modified Bitumen Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens Binder aging significantly affects the overall performance of asphalt pavements. For polymer-modified bitumen (PMB), this complex phenomenon is attributed to both polymer degradation and bitumen aging. This study aims to analyze whether the aging of hybrid PMB - combining styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) and recycled linear low-density polyethylene (RLLDPE) from waste plastic - is a result of bitumen aging, polymer degradation, or both aspects simultaneously. To further understand the aging process as a function of time, five different PMBs were subjected to long-term aging simulation using a pressure aging vessel (PAV) at three different durations (20, 40, and 60 h). SBS and RLLDPE (polymers only) were also aged under similar conditions, in order to isolate the polymer degradation from the bitumen aging. Tensile strength tests revealed that SBS is susceptible to polymer degradation and improves its elastic response as a result of aging. However, the tensile test results did not indicate whether RLLDPE underwent degradation. Results from the thermal analysis showed that RLLDPE did not significantly change the thermal events as the aging progressed. Hence, RLLDPE is assumed to have minimal degradation when subjected to long-term aging. Infrared spectroscopy results indicated that SBS underwent degradation, with aging promoting carbonyl formation, which is associated with bitumen hardening. Rheological results indicate that bitumen aging, due to thermal oxidation, is dominant compared to polymer degradation; as such, polymer degradation has minimal effects upon bitumen hardening."

"Selective extraction of polar lipids of mango kernel using Supercritical Carbon dioxide (SC–CO2) extraction: Process optimization of extract yield/phosphorous content and economic evaluation Antioxidant; Mangoes; Mangifera Indica Extract Lipids are biomolecules extracted from plant sources and plant residues and have a beneficial role in various food, nutrition and medical applications. Supercritical carbon-dioxide as an advanced high-pressure technology which increases the productivity and has negligible environmental impact is employed for the selective extraction of polar lipids from the lipid matrix in mango kernel for the first time. The process parameters affecting the extraction such as pressure, temperature and the flow rate of CO2 are ranged in the intervals of 30â€“50 MPa, 40â€“60 Â°C and 10â€“30 g min-1, respectively. Optimization using Box Behnken design obtained the highest yield of 3.38% at 40 Â°C, 50 MPa and 30 g min-1. The phosphorous content was evaluated to understand the behaviour of polar lipids extraction at higher pressures. The study showed the effect of process parameters having significant influence on polarity and solvating capacity of CO2 which enabled for the extraction of polar lipids adding value to the mango kernel converting waste into valuable industrial products. The economic evaluation estimates the return on investment of a plant processing 3000 tons of mango kernel per year to account net present value (NPV) almost five times higher than the investment expenses and the payback period is under 4 years."
"Bipartite Tracking Consensus of Linear Multi-Agent Systems with a Dynamic Leader Consensus Problem; Formation Control; Topology In this brief, the distributed bipartite tracking consensus problem for linear multi-agent systems (MASs) in the presence of a single leader is investigated. Compared with some related works on this topic, the leader's control inputs in the present MAS model are allowed to be nonzero and unknown to each follower. To guarantee bipartite tracking consensus, a new kind of distributed non-smooth protocols based on the relative state information of neighboring agents are proposed and analyzed. With the help of tools from Lyapunov stability theory and graph theory, it is shown that bipartite tracking consensus in the close-loop MAS can be achieved if the gain matrix of protocol is suitably constructed and the control parameters of protocol are, respectively, larger than some positive quantities depending on global information of the considered MAS. To provide some efficient criteria for consensus seeking without involving any global information, some fully distributed protocols with adaptive control parameters are further designed and discussed. Finally, numerical simulations are given for illustration."
"Inclusive health care for LGBTQ+ youth: support, belonging, and inclusivity labour Transgender Persons; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Sexual Behavior Drawing on findings from a study of two social generations of gender and sexuality diverse Australians, this paper offers a critical analysis of expectations and experiences of inclusive health care for LGBTQ+ youth. Data were collected by means of individual and focus group interviews with people from two different social generations who grew up in regional or urban Australia: those born in the 1970s (n = 50) and those born in the 1990s (n = 71). Data were analysed inductively to develop insights into what inclusive health care meant, and what this revealed about the potential for fostering belonging in healthcare settings. Findings raise critical questions about how inclusiveness of care might best be understood in encounters between gender and sexual minorities and health professionals. In particular, forms of â€˜inclusivity labourâ€™ were observed across the social generations, both in terms of the work involved in seeking to locate supportive services, and in assessing the performance of clinicians in healthcare settings, with implications for the continued engagement of LGBTQ+ young people with essential forms of care. Mobilising contemporary forms of inclusivity labour, including attention to the affective dimensions of healthcare engagement, has the potential to promote both better health and more meaningful experiences of belonging for gender and sexual minorities."

"Oil price uncertainty, CSR and institutional quality: A cross-country evidence Oil Price Shocks; Oil Markets; Petroleum This study investigates the relationship between crude oil price uncertainty and corporate social responsibility activities of oil and gas companies around the world. Using a cross-country dataset that consists of 283 oil and gas firms from 27 countries for the period of 2002â€“2017, we reveal three key findings. First, consistent with our hypothesis, the oil price uncertainty statistically significantly and negatively impacts corporate social responsibility engagement. Second, firms in the oil and gas industry reduce activities in the environmental and social pillars of corporate social responsibility more aggressively than those in the corporate governance pillar. Third, the negative effect of crude oil price uncertainty on corporate social responsibility is moderated by the country-level institutional quality. Our main results are consistent using a wide range of robustness tests."
"Trends in bioaccumulation and metabolite profiles in Mediterranean mussels with sub lethal exposure to mixtures of trace metals Zinc Transporter; Znaf-2; Neuron Trace metals are major environmental contaminants, and the accumulation of trace metals could cause changes to the metabolism of marine organisms. In order to understand trends in bioaccumulation and changes in metabolic pathways in marine mussels during short-term and long-term exposure to trace metal mixtures, wild Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were exposed to natural seawater spiked with two sub lethal concentrations of a mixture of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and lead (Pb) for 30 days. Mussels were collected every 5 days and trace metal levels in the whole bodies were measured. The gills of mussels collected on day 5 and day 30 were sampled separately. Trace metal levels in whole bodies of these samples were measured and metabolites in the gill tissue extracted, profiled, identified, and compared between groups with different exposure time and trace metal levels. The results showed continuous increase in body burdens of Cu and Pb in mussels throughout the exposure period, while Zn accumulation reached a plateau after day 10 in the whole body and gills. The metabolomics analysis demonstrated that multiple metabolites were down-regulated and multiple metabolic pathways possibly interrupted by exposure to the mixture of trace metals. This study provides extensive knowledge that the effects of Cu, Zn, and Pb exposure on the metabolic pathways have the potential to result in reduced fitness of Mediterranean mussels and demonstrates potential of GC-MS based untargeted metabolomics to be used as a part of trace metal pollution evaluation and ecosystem health monitoring."

"Engaging with artificial intelligence (AI) with a bottom-up approach for the purpose of sustainability: Victorian farmers market association, Melbourne Australia Machine Ethics; Artificial Intelligence; Roboethics Artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting all aspects of food systems, including production, food processing, distribution, and consumption. AI, if implemented ethically for sustainability, can enhance biodiversity, conserve water and energy resources, provide land-related services, power smart cities, and help mitigate climate change. However, there are significant issues in using AI to transition to sustainable food systems. AIâ€™s own carbon footprint could cancel out any sustainability benefits that it creates. Additionally, the technology could further entrench inequalities between and within countries, and bias against minorities or less powerful groups. This paper draws on findings from a study of the Victorian Farmersâ€™ Markets Association (VFMA) that investigated the complexity of designing AI tools to enhance sustainability and resilience for the benefit of the organisation and its members. Codesign workshops, both synchronous and asynchronous, semi-structured interviews, and design innovation methods led the VFMA to experiment with an AI tool to link sustainable soil practices, nutrient rich produce, and human health. The analysis shows that the codesign process and an agile approach created a co-learning environment where sustainability and ethical questions could be considered iteratively within transdisciplinary engagement. The bottom-up approach developed through this study supports organisations who want to engage with AI while reinforcing fairness, transparency, and sustainability."
"Ultrasonic microencapsulation of oil-soluble vitamins by hen egg white and green tea for fortification of food Drug Delivery Systems; Targeted Drug Delivery; Microcapsule We report the microencapsulation of oil soluble vitamins (A, D and E) using a one pot ultrasonic process and raw egg white proteins as a shell material. Green tea catechin/iron complex coating method was further developed to impart UV filtering property to the microcapsules in order to protect the encapsulated nutrients from photodegradation. The microcapsules showed antibacterial properties and long shelf-life. The encapsulated vitamins were protected from degradation upon heating, UV irradiation, simulated storage/transit and cooking processes. The in-vitro digestion study showed that functional vitamin D can be potentially released in the gastrointestinal tract improving vitamin D availability by more than 2-fold compared to the free vitamin. The vitamin D microcapsules were highly stable and maintained their microstructures once incorporated into staple food products. The low-cost egg white shell encapsulated vitamins can improve the nutritional value of staple food products to combat maternal and child malnutrition."
"Optimizing the energy consumption in a residential building at different climate zones: Towards sustainable decision making Walls (Structural Partitions); Hot Temperature; Insulation Electricity dependent heating-cooling (H/C) system has increased rapidly to provide thermal comfort to the occupants. H/C is a major source of energy consumption in residential buildings around the world. Studies revealed that the thermal properties of building materials are converted into the same unit as thermal resistance (R) in the USA, Canada, The UK, Australia, and other countries. However, none of the previous studies have considered the adaptation of national insulation codes to reduce electricity cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the correlations of energy consumption (Q) to thermal resistances (R) of the building envelop (A). Therefore, this study attempts to review the optimum energy consumption of a selected house due to H/C at different choices of national code standardized R values. Accurate envelop areas (A) of the selected house components are estimated by applying the Autodesk Revit Building Information Model (BIM) to use in the energy model. The case study critically evaluates the variation of electricity cost, GHG emissions, and selection of the optimized thermostat settings for energy savings in different climatic regions and seasons of a year. Different correlations are obtained using risk analysis software on energy consumptions with code recognized arrays of insulations. This sensitivity analysis result shows that the corelation coefficient of energy consumption with medium-low insulated building envelop (r = 0.44) is more significant than improved, maximum, medium-high, and minimum insulations (r = 0.14â€“0.29) which indicates the insulation range where more emphasis should be put to get an optimized solution. Thus the developed analytical framework supports inclusive decision-making by selecting appropriate kinds of insulation for the design of a sustainable house."

"Natural compounds from the marine brown alga caulocystis cephalornithos with potent in vitro-activity against the parasitic nematode haemonchus contortus Haemonchus Contortus; Monepantel; Anthelmintic Agent Eight secondary metabolites (1 to 8) were isolated from a marine sponge, a marine alga and three terrestrial plants collected in Australia and subsequently chemically characterised. Here, these natural product-derived compounds were screened for in vitro-anthelmintic activity against the larvae and adult stages of Haemonchus contortus (barberâ€™s pole worm)â€”a highly pathogenic parasitic nematode of ruminants. Using an optimised, whole-organism screening system, compounds were tested on exsheathed third-stage larvae (xL3s) and fourth-stage larvae (L4s). Anthelmintic activity was initially evaluated on these stages based on the inhibition of motility, development and/or changes in morphology (phenotype). We identified two compounds, 6-undecylsalicylic acid (3) and 6-tridecylsalicylic acid (4) isolated from the marine brown alga, Caulocystis cephalornithos, with inhibitory effects on xL3 and L4 motility and larval development, and the induction of a â€œskinny-straightâ€ phenotype. Subsequent testing showed that these two compounds had an acute nematocidal effect (within 1â€“12 h) on adult males and females of H. contortus. Ultrastructural analysis of adult worms treated with compound 4 revealed significant damage to subcuticular musculature and associated tissues and cellular organelles including mitochondria. In conclusion, the present study has discovered two algal compounds possessing acute anthelmintic effects and with potential for hit-to-lead progression. Future work should focus on undertaking a structure-activity relationship study and on elucidating the mode(s) of action of optimised compounds."

"Prediction of the resilient modulus of compacted subgrade soils using ensemble machine learning methods Unbound; Pavements; Subgrade The accurate estimation of resilient modulus (MR) of compacted subgrade soil is imperative for the safe and sustainable design of flexible pavement systems. The aim of this study is to explore the potential of ensemble machine learning techniques for predicting the MR of pavement subgrade soil. For this, 2813 data points from twelve compacted subgrade soils were collected which consists of the following inputs parameters: dry unit weight, weighted plasticity index, deviator stress, confining stress, number of freezeâ€“thaw cycles, and moisture content. Four commonly used machine learning (ML) methods, namely, gradient boosting regression (GBR), decision tree regression (DTR), K nearest neighbour regression (KNR), and random forest regression (RFR) were developed and implemented for forecasting the MR value. Thereafter, several ensemble ML techniques including voting ensemble (VO-ENSM), voting ensemble with RF as a meta-model (VO-ENSM (RF)), stacking ensemble (ST-ENSM) and bagging ensemble (BG-ENSM) were utilised to amalgamate the outputs from the developed standalone ML models. Additionally, a multiple linear regression model was also developed as a baseline. The predictive veracity, reliability and trustworthiness of the developed ensemble models were corroborated using rigorous statistical testing, ranking technique, and uncertainty analysis. The results as obtained have shown that the BG-ENSM outperformed its counterparts in predicting the MR of subgrade soil. Hence, it can be a part of portfolio of predicting tools utilised by the practitioners in evaluating the strength of the pavement subgrade soil. Finally, the sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the strength of input variables on the MR."

"Potential for sustainable utilisation of agricultural residues for bioenergy production in Pakistan: An overview Pakistan; Renewable Energy Policy; Fossil Fuel Pakistan's current energy portfolio is problematic due to a lack of proper management and implementation of appropriate energy policies. This densely populated country has a high energy demand that rises yearly and is expected to increase three-fold by 2050. However, fossil fuel resources are continuously depleting by global overuse while negatively impacting the environment through increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This study reviewed the potential for agricultural residues to be used as renewable energy sources for bioenergy production in Pakistan to address the energy-related challenges that would also help in addressing the economic and environmental concerns. First, a comparison was made between the current energy situation, potential renewable energy scenarios, and global trends. Second, greenhouse gas (i.e., CO2) emissions in Pakistan were summarised and compared with other regions. Third, the thermochemical properties of different agricultural residues were reviewed along with varying the options of processing to produce renewable energy such as thermochemical conversion approaches (combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and liquefaction) and biochemical conversion options (anaerobic digestion, and fermentation). Pakistan being an agricultural-based economy, produces vast quantities of agricultural residue biomass, which is mostly underutilized as animal feed, conventional fuel substitutes, left to rot in fields or burnt to get rid, resulting in the vast emissions of greenhouse gases causing severe environmental pollution and smog formation. A considerable share of Pakistan's national energy demand can be fulfilled if these feedstocks are adequately managed and exploited through the energy sector and converted into large-scale bioenergy."
"Decision model to integrate community preferences and nudges into the selection of alternatives in infrastructure development Tendering; Project Delivery; Lean Production Selection of alternatives for sustainable infrastructure development is governed by many quantitative and qualitative factors that may be conflicting such as life cycle cost, environmental concerns, expansion feasibility, projected community growth, perception of the communities, lobbying efforts, and regulatory requirements. A framework to integrate these intrinsic factors is the basis of an optimal, sustainable, transparent, and practical decision. In this paper we present a decision model to reflect social and political dynamics in a multi-criteria decision making framework at the early stages of sustainable infrastructure development. The concepts of choosing by advantages (CBA), equilibria of social power between actors, and life cycle cost analysis are used to assess the decision in environmental/technical, social/political, and economic dimensions. Application of the model is discussed for the case of selecting urban/rural wastewater system alternatives. Theoretically, the proposed multi-dimensional decision model aims to integrate the political and social dynamics of the actors including their incentives into the structured decision space of sustainable infrastructure. The proposed model also further extends the existing literature through transparent account of trade-offs across technical, economic, and political dimensions of the selection of alternatives. Policy makers can specifically apply it in the feasibility stage of infrastructure development to facilitate integration of sustainability goals within a network of involved actors, observe the potential trade-offs between sustainability metrics, increase practicality and transparency of the public policy making, and explore the potential impact of nudges to instigate sustainability within infrastructure development."
"Attitudes and behaviors as predictors of service quality in the telecommunications sector context Personnel; Civic Virtue; Transformational Leadership Purpose: Service quality (SQ) is considered an organizational performance indicator that largely depends on employeesâ€™ attitudes and behaviors. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the mediating effect of employeesâ€™ citizenship behavior (OCB) on the relationship between affective commitment (AC) and SQ. Design/methodology/approach: The current study has relied on two questionnaire surveys to gather cross-sectional data from 800 employees and 400 customers of telecommunications companies in Kuwait. Structural equation modeling via AMOS22 was used to build and test the hypothesized model. Findings: The results show that OCB significantly and positively affects SQ dimensions except empathy which demonstrates insignificant association. Also, AC was found to be a strong predictor of OCB. More interestingly, the results show that AC does not show any effect on either responsiveness or empathy, while a partial mediation was found between AC and tangibles, reliability, and assurance. Practical implications: The findings of the current study provide managers and practitioners with empirically validated model of how SQ can be achieved. The model indicates that managers need to increase the level of citizenship behavior through leveraging their employeesâ€™ AC, which in turn can result in a positive perception of SQ. Originality/value: This study is considered among the first to investigate the causal effect of both OCB and AC on achieving high SQ. Also, the findings of this study further support the indirect relationship of AC and SQ. Moreover, this study is unique in its attempt to link both AC and OCB to the dimensions of SQ. Finally, this study is considered the first empirical investigation of SQ in the telecommunication sector in Kuwait."
"Investigating the learning process in job search: A longitudinal study Information Behaviour; Information Retrieval; Web Search We investigated the learning process in search by conducting a log-based study involving registered job seekers of a commercial job search engine. The analysis shows that job search is a complex task: seekers usually submit multiple queries over sessions that can last days or even weeks. We find that querying, clicking, and job application rates change over time: job seekers tend to use more filters and a less diverse set of query terms. In terms of click and application behavior, we observed a significant decrease in click rate and query term diversity, as well as an increase in application rates. These trends are found to largely match information seeking models of learning in a complex search task. However, common behaviors are observed in the logs that suggest the existing models may not be sufficient to describe all of the users' learning and seeking processes."
"Towards zero carbon housing in Victoria, Australia: A policy and incentive framework Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation Zero carbon housing has been forwarded by researchers and policymakers as a way to reduce carbon emissions from the residential sector globally. Although policies promoting zero or low carbon housing have been set in several regions, there has been limited policy development towards this performance outcome in Australia. The research in this paper aims to address this issue through evaluating existing policy and incentives frameworks and proposing adaptations that can be used to promote and increase the delivery of zero carbon housing in the studied region, i.e., Victoria, Australia. The research utilised a systematic qualitative and quantitative research approach across three key phases. In the first phase, a literature review was conducted to provide a depiction of the existing policy framework and incentives in Australia and other representative countries. In the second phase, a workshop with key policymakers and academics was conducted to refine a draft online questionnaire for different stakeholders of zero carbon housing. Additional semi-structured interviews were also conducted with the policy departments of the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP), Victoria. In the third phase of the research, the online survey was finalised and distributed to randomly sampled key stakeholders. The study reveals that builders lack experience in the construction of zero carbon houses, which was identified as a critical factor hindering the adoption of such houses. Financial incentives of state governments were identified as essential to stimulate the adoption of zero carbon houses in order to overcome any additional capital costs. The analysis informs the development of a proposed policy framework that could shape and scale up the development of policies and financial support to deliver zero carbon housing, not only in Australia but also in other jurisdictions, as the residential sector plays an increasing role in the transition to a low carbon future."
"Influence of hydrogen-enhanced plasticity and decohesion mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement on the fracture resistance of steel Hydrogen Embrittlement; Fatigue Crack Growth; Steel Hydrogen gas is a renewable energy source for electrical and transportation fuel for vehicular applications. However, the storage and transportation of hydrogen gas are challenging because of its very nature and impact on pipelines and storage tank/facility materials. This paper investigates the influence of hydrogen on the candidate fracture toughness (KQ) of low carbon steel immersed in acidic hydrogen environments for one year which has limited previous research. Steel specimens were coated from all sides except one surface to accurately quantify the influence of hydrogen diffusing from the environments into the specimens. Specimens were tested for crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) fracture toughness at six- and twelve-month intervals of immersion in acidic environments. Before KQ testing at various intervals, the hydrogen contents of the specimens were determined by an electrochemical approach. Based on test results, models for the degradation of KQ of steel were developed in accordance with the proposed hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) and hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) model (HELP + HEDE model) of hydrogen embrittlement. Furthermore, fractography of the specimens was performed to observe the synergistic action of HELP and HEDE mechanisms (HE), and their subsequent effects on the microstructure and fracture resistance of steel. The significance of the research is highlighted by its practical application for assessing the durability of steel structures and infrastructure against hydrogen environmental assisted cracking (HEAC). Furthermore, this paper highlights the synergistic activity of HELP and HEDE mechanisms of HE in steel and the importance of developing structures for storing hydrogen on a large scale."

"R&D intensity and income inequality in the G7: 1870–2016 Wage Inequality; Wages; Skill Premium We examine how R&D has contributed to income inequality in the Group of Seven countries from 1870 to 2016. Using newly developed panel data models that incorporate interactive fixed effects, we find that R&D is negatively associated with income inequality. Non-parametric models that allow us to capture the time-varying effect of R&D suggest that this average effect has been negative for most of this period. We find that economic growth and trade are important mechanisms through which R&D transmits to income inequality."
"Entrepreneurial Finance: Insights from English Language Training Market in Vietnam Financial Management; Venture Capital; Private Equity Entrepreneurship plays an indispensable role in the economic development and poverty reduction of emerging economies like Vietnam. The rapid development of technologies during the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) has a significant impact on business in every field, especially in the innovation-focused area of entrepreneurship. However, the topic of entrepreneurial activities with technology applications in Vietnam is under-researched. In addition, the body of literature regarding entrepreneurial finance tends to focus on advanced economies, while mostly neglecting the contextual differences in developing nations. Therefore, this research contributes to these topics by investigating the main characteristics of a high potential market for entrepreneurs in Vietnam, which is the English language training market (ELTM). It also aims at indicating the impacts of technology on the entrepreneurial firms within this market, with an emphasis on financing sources. To answer the research questions, this study employs a qualitative analysis and conducts 12 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs and researchers in the field. The key findings in our study highlight the main contributing factors to the growth of the market, both universally and context-specific for a developing nation like Vietnam. It also lists the leaders in each market segment and the industryâ€™s potential profit margin. The results also show that most entrepreneurs in the ELTM utilized private sources of finance rather than external ones, such as bank loans. It again confirms the idea from previous works that even with the rapid development of the economic and technological landscape, entrepreneurial activities in general barely benefit from additional sources of funding. However, it also points out the distinct characteristics of the ELTM that may influence these financing issues; for example, English training services usually collect revenues from customers before delivering their classes. This is of advantage for entrepreneurs in this area and helps significantly reduce the financial barriers. These findings, which are among the first attempts to contribute to a better understanding of entrepreneurial opportunities in the Industry 4.0 in Vietnam, provide valuable insights for policymakers and entrepreneurs, as well as investors."

"Microfinance financial sustainability and outreach: is there a trade-off? Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion The financial sustainability of microfinance institutions (MFIs) is crucial for the continual existence of the microfinance industry. As a result, emphasis has been placed on the financial sustainability of MFIs over the past few years. However, with the primary goal of the industry being the attainment of social outreach, the emphasis on financial sustainability has raised concerns about a potential adverse effect on outreach. Using data on 1595 MFIs in 109 countries, we examine if there is a trade-off between financial sustainability and outreach. The evidence shows that there is a trade-off between sustainability and outreach depth, but complementarity between sustainability and outreach breadth."
"Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol over ZnFe2O4/TiO2 (p–n) heterojunctions under visible light irradiation Carbon Dioxide; Photocatalysts; Artificial Photosynthesis BACKGROUND: The development of visible light photocatalysts for CO2 reduction into methanol is a challenge, as most of the reported photocatalysts can only work in a UV light environment. Slow kinetics and poor selectivity of CO2 towards methanol are currently two significant drawbacks limiting the practical application of CO2 reduction into methanol. RESULTS: A ZnFe2O4/TiO2 heterojunction with a ratio of unity was found to lead to the highest methanol yield of 693.31 Î¼mol (g cat)âˆ’1 under a light intensity of 100 mW cmâˆ’2. This photocatalyst also possessed the highest BET surface area of 6.5211 m2 gâˆ’1 and better morphological structure, as compared with other ratios (1:2, 2:1 w/w). Interestingly, a loading of 1 g Lâˆ’1 of ZnFe2O4/TiO2 (1:1) heterojunction photocatalyst in the pre-annealing treatment of ZnFe2O4 at 900 Â°C and post-annealing treatment of ZnFe2O4/TiO2 (1:1) composite at 500 Â°C revealed that there was an enhancement in the interfacial interaction, and subsequently an efficient photoreduction of CO2 into methanol. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates facile fabrication of pâ€“n heterostructured phototcatalysts for reduction of CO2 with marked improvement in methanol yield under visible light irradiation. It provides a viable route for exploring the effects of composition, hydrothermal treatment, and pre-/post-annealing treatment of hybrid semiconductor composites used to scale up photocatalytic CO2 conversion in solar fuel-based devices."
"Accounting and pseudo spirituality in Islamic financial institutions Accounting History; Double-Entry Bookkeeping; Social Responsibility The global financial crisis was followed by calls for a transformation of conventional finance, towards more ethico-aesthetic models. One avenue was to consider the alternative aesthetic of Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). IFIs offer profit-loss sharing (PLS) schemes as a distinctive spiritual alternative to conventional investment products. IFIs ontotheology clashes with the epistemology of modern banking and finance. The accounting for PLS creates tensions due to practical complexity that militates against implementation of the authentic Islamic financial contracts. This paper seeks to identify the role of accounting in IFIsâ€™ practice of interpretation to resolve the struggles that have taken place around the implementation of PLS schemes as a means of spiritual based financial alternatives. We explore how IFIs use accounting in rendering notions of spiritual/prophetic values applicable to practice or how it colludes against their implementation. Our study adopts a qualitative research methodology, framed around 40 interviews and observations of PLS implementation in IFIs in five Muslim countries in Asia and the Middle East, and one in the United Kingdom. We combine the literature on accounting and religion with the ideas/concepts from the literature on religion in organizations, political economy and Islamic law/finance. These perspectives enable us to better reveal how accounting works to reinvent spirituality. In our context we show how accounting mediates the conflicting interests and intentions that arise within the epistemological clashes that happen as the scared/religious strives to take its place in the capitalistic context of the conventional finance industry."
"Gut Microbial Changes, Interactions, and Their Implications on Human Lifecycle: An Ageing Perspective Intestine Flora; Ruminococcaceae; Microorganisms Gut microbiota is established during birth and evolves with age, mostly maintaining the commensal relationship with the host. A growing body of clinical evidence suggests an intricate relationship between the gut microbiota and the immune system. With ageing, the gut microbiota develops significant imbalances in the major phyla such as the anaerobic Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as well as a diverse range of facultative organisms, resulting in impaired immune responses. Antimicrobial therapy is commonly used for the treatment of infections; however, this may also result in the loss of normal gut flora. Advanced age, antibiotic use, underlying diseases, infections, hormonal differences, circadian rhythm, and malnutrition, either alone or in combination, contribute to the problem. This nonbeneficial gastrointestinal modulation may be reversed by judicious and controlled use of antibiotics and the appropriate use of prebiotics and probiotics. In certain persistent, recurrent settings, the option of faecal microbiota transplantation can be explored. The aim of the current review is to focus on the establishment and alteration of gut microbiota, with ageing. The review also discusses the potential role of gut microbiota in regulating the immune system, together with its function in healthy and diseased state."

"Choice of pyrolysis parameters for urban wastes affects soil enzymes and plant germination in a Mediterranean soil Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon The production of organic waste has steadily increased in recent years, with subsequent impact on the environment. The European Union committed to diminish the volume of biodegradable municipal waste disposed of in landfills by 2016â€“2020. The synthesis of biochar from urban waste and its application to improve soil quality can constitute a novel route for valorization. The aim of this paper was to study the effect of three biochars originated from pyrolysis of the organic fraction of urban waste at two different temperatures (300 Â°C and 500 Â°C) and two residence times (1 h and 5 h) on the biochemical properties of an agricultural soil. Soil was amended with biochars at a rate of 8% and incubated for 74 days. A phytotoxicity assay, using garden cress as the test species, was conducted. CO2 emissions, microbial biomass C and the enzymes dehydrogenase, phosphomonoesterase and Î²-glucosidase were measured in tested soils. Biochars prepared at 300 Â°C resulted in lower germination index values, which could partly be ascribed to a higher bioavailability of heavy metals and higher soluble organic matter, while the biochar prepared as 500 Â°C exhibited a phytostimulant effect. Biochars produced at 300 Â°C (B300-1 h, B300-5 h) augmented soil CO2 emissions while there was no effect on microbial respiration in the soil amended with the biochar prepared at 500 Â°C. Pyrolysis temperature and, for some enzymes, residence time, controlled soil enzymatic activity."
"Relationships between geomorphological features and groundwater geochemistry in the upper and middle basin of Las Peñas stream, Pampean Mountains, Córdoba. Argentina Groundwater Samples; Water Quality; Piper Las PeÃ±as stream basin, located in the Pampean Mountains of Cordoba (Argentina), has specific groundwater features which are of great interest for the local socioeconomic activities. The objective of this work is to define the geomorphological characteristics of the basin and interpret their influence on hydrogeological processes, emphasizing hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemical aspects. Groundwater flow in the unconfined aquifer has developed in both sediments and fractured rocks. The groundwater is fresh with electrical conductivities between 586 ÂµS/cm and 2000 ÂµS/cm, although there are localized samples in the piedmont of brackish type (up to 3900 ÂµS/cm). Sampled groundwaters are almost entirely of calcium and sodium bicarbonate geochemical type, with local occurrence of mixed type (sodium-calcium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate-sulfate) waters. Taking into account geomorphological and lithological features, both groundwater flow and hydrochemical aspects are linked with the main geomorphological environments: a relict paleosurface with a sedimentary cover, a rocky dissected paleosurface with filled valleys and the sedimentary piedmont. It was interpreted that groundwater geochemistry is mainly linked to input from precipitation and weathering of silicates. Dissolution of carbonates and cation exchange processes contribute to the observed groundwater chemistry especially in the relict paleosurface and piedmont."

"Local urban climate governance in Nepal: The interplay between national governments and aid agencies Aid; Official Development Assistance; International Cooperation Multi-lateral aid come from various Bilateral-aid agencies that play a crucial role in supporting developing nations around the world to address climate change issues. Despite significant effort from aid agencies, it is not clear how aid is received and distributed at local level in recipient countries. This paper highlights some of the challenges associated with funding obtained and utilised particularly to address climate change adaptation via case study of Kathmandu, Nepal. This empirical research is funded by the Government of Australia. This research draws on PhD research including a review of the literature and in-depth interviews with governing actors such as local planners in Kathmandu, climate experts, academics, and community members. The study focused on understanding the impacts of international and aid agency investment in climate action at the local urban scale. Key findings reveal that over the past decade significant resources were spent in capacity building programs nationally, but with limited contribution at the level of local adaptation in the urban regions. Local governing agencies and authorities have little capacity to address urban scale needs. Results of the study suggest that the process of distributing aid funding and evaluation of its impact is not transparent. This raised a number of questions around the legitimacy of governing climate change adaptation programs from the top down."

"The impact of gender-role-orientations on subjective career success: A multilevel study of 36 societies Workplace; Sexism; Gender Stereotypes We investigate the relationships between gender-role-orientation (i.e., androgynous, masculine, feminine and undifferentiated) and subjective career success among business professionals from 36 societies. Drawing on the resource management perspective, we predict that androgynous individuals will report the highest subjective career success, followed by masculine, feminine, and undifferentiated individuals. We also postulate that meso-organizational culture and macro-societal values will have moderating effects on gender role's impact on subjective career success. The results of our hierarchical linear models support the hypothesized hierarchy of the relationships between gender-role-orientations and subjective career success. However, we found that ethical achievement values at the societal culture level was the only variable that had a positive moderating impact on the relationship between feminine orientation and subjective career success. Thus, our findings of minimal moderation effect suggest that meso- and macro-level environments may not play a significant role in determining an individual's perception of career success."
"Microglia depletion fails to abrogate inflammation-induced sickness in mice and rats Alzheimer Disease; Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Synapses Background: Production of inflammatory mediators by reactive microglial cells in the brain is generally considered the primary mechanism underlying the development of symptoms of sickness in response to systemic inflammation. Methods: Depletion of microglia was achieved in C57BL/6 mice by chronic oral administration of PLX5622, a specific antagonist of colony stimulating factor-1 receptor, and in rats by a knock-in model in which the diphtheria toxin receptor was expressed under the control of the endogenous fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) promoter sequence. After successful microglia depletion, mice and rats were injected with a sickness-inducing dose of lipopolysaccharide according to a 2 (depletion vs. control) Ã— 2 (LPS vs. saline) factorial design. Sickness was measured by body weight loss and decreased locomotor activity in rats and mice, and reduced voluntary wheel running in mice. Results: Chronic administration of PLX5622 in mice and administration of diphtheria toxin to knock-in rats depleted microglia and peripheral tissue macrophages. However, it did not abrogate the inducible expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain in response to LPS and even exacerbated it for some of the cytokines. In accordance with these neuroimmune effects, LPS-induced sickness was not abrogated, rather it was exacerbated when measured by running wheel activity in mice. Conclusions: These findings reveal that the sickness-inducing effects of acute inflammation can develop independently of microglia activation."

"Women as helpmates: the Japan Self-Defense Forces and gender Flexible Work; Japan; Symbolic Interactionism As the Japan Self-Defense Forces becomes â€˜closerâ€™ to everyday people, discourses surrounding military masculinities and femininities shift. This paper takes a â€˜curious feministâ€™ approach to the shifting significance of the JSDF and asks the question, â€˜What can the changing JSDF tell us about its relationship with women?â€™ I explore representations of women and men in three JSDF-related publicationsâ€“a matchmaking website that caters to male soldiers and women civilians, Jieitai Premium Club; a popular manga series drawn by a woman married to a JSDF man, Totsugeki Jiekan Zuma; and the monthly JSDF publication, Mamorâ€“and suggest that despite the ostensible pursuit of gender equality within the JSDF as evidenced in the increased recruitment of women, and the promoting of women to higher ranks, women continue to be imagined as â€˜helpmatesâ€™, just as they were during Japanâ€™s modernization process. They are discursively constructed as helpmates to men as wives and other female companions, and in being so constructed, become (un/conscious) supporters of the JSDF and thus helpmates to the state."

"Housing for degrowth: Principles, models, challenges and opportunities Degrowth; Environmental Conflict; Aciclovir â€˜Degrowthâ€™, a type of â€˜postgrowthâ€™, is becoming a strong political, practical and cultural movement for downscaling and transforming societies beyond capitalist growth and non-capitalist productivism to achieve global sustainability and satisfy everyoneâ€™s basic needs. This groundbreaking collection on housing for degrowth addresses key challenges of unaffordable, unsustainable and anti-social housing today, including going beyond struggles for a â€˜right to the cityâ€™ to a â€˜right to metabolismâ€™, advocating refurbishment versus demolition, and revealing controversies within the degrowth movement on urbanisation, decentralisation and open localism. International case studies show how housing for degrowth is based on sufficiency and conviviality, living a â€˜one planet lifestyleâ€™ with a common ecological footprint. This book explores environmental, cultural and economic housing and planning issues from interdisciplinary perspectives such as urbanism, ecological economics, environmental justice, housing studies and policy, planning studies and policy, sustainability studies, political ecology, social change and degrowth. It will appeal to students and scholars across a wide range of disciplines."

"Spatial differentiation of non-grain production on cultivated land and its driving factors in coastal China Sleuths; Cellular Automaton Model; Urbanization The rapid development of urbanization and industrialization in coastal China in the past 20 years has exerted a huge squeezing effect on agricultural land use. The phenomenon of non-grain production on cultivated land (NGP) is very common, seriously threatening the protection of high-quality arable land and national food security. In order to find out the overall situation regarding NGP on cultivated land in coastal China, this study revealed the spatial differentiation of NGP and its main driving factors by spatial autocorrelation analysis, multiple linear regression models and geographically weighted regression analysis (GWR). The results show that: (1) in 2018, the non-grain cultivated land area of 11 provinces along the coast of China was about 15.82 Ã— 106 hm2, accounting for 33.65% of the total cultivated land area. (2) The NGP rate in 11 provinces gradually decreased from south to north, but the NGP area showed two peak centers in Guangxi province and Shandong province, then decreased gradually outwards. (3) The low economic benefit of the planting industry (per capita GDP and urban-to-rural disposable income ratio) was the most important driving force, leading to the spatial differentiation of NGP, while the number of rural laborers and land transfer areas also acted as the main driving factors for the spatial differentiation of NGP. However, the influence of each driving factor has obvious spatial heterogeneity. The non-grained area and the non-grain production rate at the municipal level were completely different from those at the provincial level, and the spatial heterogeneity was more prominent. In the future, the local government should control the disorganized spread of NGP, scientifically set the bottom line of NGP, reduce the external pressure of NGP, regulate multi-party land transfer behavior, and strengthen land-use responsibilities. This study can provide a scientific foundation for adjusting land-use planning and cultivated land protection policies in China and other developing countries."
"Writing the Feminist Internet: a Chthonian Feminist Internet Theory for the twenty first century Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work This paper analytically responds to the collaborative performance work Writing the Feminist Internet as a motif of fourth wave feminism. It probes at the edge of Internet dark spaces that are often occupied by those who point to complacency in engagement with networking systems, by drawing auxiliary attention to the apparatus. Further examination sheds light on the valences and anarchy of technopolitics that transpired and reflects on the call for â€˜hybrid of feminist activist effortsâ€™ noted by Emma A. Jane. Positing towards â€˜a recalibrated approach to collectivismâ€™ (2015, 285) Jane continues to give rise to a vast communal realm for the expression of alternative behaviours. In building upon the feminist â€˜waveâ€™ metaphor there is acknowledgement that the undercurrents of nautical lineages come to endure through â€˜debt, or inheritanceâ€™ more often than a confluence of flows. The findings reveal that the potency of a chthonic feminist internet theory lies in its indeterminate stance. In conclusion, it is proposed that ambivalence and prominence in obscurity in such expansive â€˜dark social spacesâ€™ is where new meanings and enunciations can brew and be read as a source of critical and aesthetic ambiguity, amongst the highly revered principles of disarray, pandemonium and incompleteness."
"Indigenous masculinity in sport: the power and pitfalls of rugby league for Australia’s Pacific Island diaspora Fiji; Sports; Methodism Pasifika men are significantly over-represented in Australiaâ€™s National Rugby League and their dramatic influx into the sport over the past 10â€“15 years has often been attributed to their â€˜naturalâ€™ athleticism and other corporeal reasons invoking hyper-masculinity. Coupled with this discourse is the commonly accepted idea that these sporting opportunities are a good thing for Pasifika peoples. This paper considers both the damaging effects of the â€˜hyper-masculine bodyâ€™ and â€˜sport-as-inherently goodâ€™ discourses, and addresses the positive potential rugby league has in transgressing various forms of oppression. Rather than arguing that sport is a positive force in society or outright challenging that assertion, I demonstrate how rugby league in Australia plays a paradoxical role in both reinforcing and challenging social values around race and masculinity. It can be a rare space for positive visibility and upward mobility for Pasifika and other Indigenous men, and a space of exploitation, degradation and racism; it can even save lives and destroy them. I argue that these complexities should be better understood before any moral claim is made about the positives or negatives of sport for marginalised peoples."
"A Case Study of GPS Characteristics of Urban Area in Ho Chi Minh Based on Ride-Sharing Services Traffic Behavior; Accident; Telematics Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) have always been the common goal for the developing countries and for the fast-paced development of ride-sharing services. It is essential to have an accurate traffic profile for the existing infrastructure to predict behaviour of the traffic and its structure for the efficient operation of the ITS. The most common technology, developed nowadays for the traffic monitoring, is Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) which allows detection of the current location, speed and motion direction of the vehicles. This paper presents the case study of Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam using Global Positioning System (GPS) with data collected on both motorbike and car transportation services. The study demonstrates different geographical characteristics of the selected city areas based on the traffic behaviours, surrounding areal infrastructure and GPS signal characteristics, such as strengths, stability, and continuity. The outcome suggests appropriate implementation for GPS-driven application in traffic monitoring, control and potential benefits for network distribution in expanding urban areas. This research also provides a persistence methodology applicable for other cities with similar transportation profile within South East Asia countries."
"Adaptive governance in carbon farming policies Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework This book discusses a variety of different perspectives involved in biodiversity management and bio-sequestration projects in Australia, working towards achieving adaptive governance in carbon farming. It not only examines landholders' motivation but also the challenges of integrating biodiverse forests into the agricultural landscape. Drawing on the contrast between science and policy stakeholders' views on carbon farming and the practical challenges of achieving adaptive governance, the book discusses the significant gap between theory and practice encountered in this field of study. The book suggests ways of improving the decision-making capacity of government officials and policymakers involved in managing carbon and biodiversity markets, as well as introducing measures to promote adaptive governance by engaging landholders in more effective land conservation. Climate change is a pressing issue on the global political agenda, and this book makes an important contribution to the ongoing debate. This book will be an invaluable reference for practitioners, policymakers and researchers interested in alternative forms of governance in natural resource management."
"Governing youth politics in the age of surveillance Medical Ethics; Protestant Work Ethic; Islamic This book explores a contemporary paradox: Young people are at the forefront of global campaigns promoting social justice, sustainability and rights yet governments repress and regulate this political project using everything from surveillance to violent repression. The book provides a global overview of the relationship between democracy, dissent and repression. This groundbreaking book explores how, especially since 9/11, governments and state agencies and other traditional power holders globally have reacted to political dissent engaged in by young people. Using rich and detailed case studies from many continents, the book explores a major contemporary paradox: Young people are at the forefront of global campaigns promoting social justice, sustainability and rights, yet governments that consistently claim they want to promote youth participation do all they can to control and repress this political activity."
"Review of drivers and threats to coastal groundwater quality in China Nutrients; Submarines; Radon With rapid socio-economic development, China's coastal areas are among the fastest growing and most economically dynamic regions in the world. Under the influence of climate change and human activities, protecting the quality of coastal groundwater has emerged as one of the key environmental and resource management issues for these areas. This paper reviews (for the first time) groundwater quality data for the coastal basins of China, where over 600 million people live, focussing on key inorganic indicators/pollutants; groundwater salinity, nitrate, fluoride, and arsenic. These pollutants present major water quality issues and are also valuable as indicators of wider processes and influences impacting coastal groundwater quality â€“ e.g. saltwater intrusion, agricultural pollution and release of geo-genic contaminants. We discuss the major drivers causing water quality problems in different regions and assess future trajectories and challenges for controlling changes in coastal groundwater quality in China. Multiple processes, including modern and palaeo seawater/brine migration, groundwater pumping for agricultural irrigation, pollution from agrochemical application, rapid development of aquaculture, urban growth, and water transfer projects, may all be responsible (to different degrees) for changes observed in coastal groundwater quality, and associated long-term health and ecological effects. We discuss implications for sustainable coastal aquifer management in China, arguing that groundwater monitoring and contamination control measures require urgent improvement. The evolution and treatment of coastal groundwater quality problems in China will serve as an important warning and example for other countries facing similar pressures, due to climate change, coastal development, and intensification of anthropogenic activity in coming decades."

"Factors affecting the intrusiveness and selection of real-site data collection methods in hot and humid climates: critical review Wet-Bulb Temperature; Heat-Shock Response; Threshold Limit Values Purpose: Hot and humid climates (HHCs) are potential environmental hazards that directly affect construction workers' health and safety (HS) and negatively impact workers' productivity. Extensive research efforts have addressed the effects of HHCs. However, these efforts have been inconsistent in their approach for selecting factors influencing workers in such conditions. There are also increasing concerns about the drop-off in research interest to follow through intrusive and non-real-time measurements. This review aims to identify the major research gaps in measurements applied in previous research with careful attention paid to the factors that influence the intrusiveness and selection of the applied data collection methods. Design/methodology/approach: This research integrates a manual subjective discussion with a thematic analysis of Leximancer software and an elaborating chronological, geographical and methodological review that yielded 701 articles and 76 peer-reviewed most related articles. Findings: The literature included the physiological parameters as influencing factors and useful indicators for HHC effects and identified site activity intensity as the most influencing work-related factor. In total, three main gaps were identified: (1) the role of substantial individual and work-related factors; (2) managerial interventions and the application of the right time against the right symptoms, sample size and measurement intervals and (3) applied methods of data collection; particularly, the intrusiveness of the utilised sensors. Practical implications: The focus of researchers and practitioners should be in applying nonintrusive, innovative and real-time methods that can provide crew-level measurements. In particular, methods that can represent the actual effects of allocated tasks are aligned with real-time weather measurements, so proactive HHC-related preventions can be enforced on time. Originality/value: This review contributes to the field of construction workers' safety in HHCs and enables researchers and practitioners to identify the most influential individual and work-related factors in HHCs. This review also proposes a framework for future research with suggestions to cover the highlighted research gaps and contributes to a critical research area in the construction industry."

"Utilization of distillery effluent as substrate for power generation with optimized parametric conditions using microbial fuel cell Bioenergy; Regenerative Fuel Cells; Bioelectricity Distillery effluents create many environmental problems via their direct disposal in open ponds. There is a need to explore the technology for treating such wastes and making useful energy from it. In the modern era, Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) are gaining popularity regarding working mechanism for treating wastewater as well as electricity generation. Current study primarily focuses to utilize distillery effluent as valuable substrate in microbial fuel cell coupled with a parametric effect. Saccharomyces cerevisiae were utilized as biocatalyst in MFC with different organic loads in the form of substrate concentration followed by various aeration rate, and pH for power generation. With numerous changes in aeration rate, substrate concentration, and pH values automatically effect on power generation. The maximum power generation was observed at 175 mg/l about power density 69 mW/m 2 , current density 82.48 mA/m 2 , voltage 770 mv, power 0.6391 mW and current 0.83 mA. It is concluded that by utilizing microbial fuel cell we can handle the problem associated with distillery wastewater.

"An end-user-focused building energy audit: A high-density multi-residential development in Melbourne, Australia Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Office Buildings This chapter aims to demonstrate a building energy audit process using a case study of high-density multi-residential modular development in inner Melbourne, Australia. An energy audit is essential to understand where and how energy is used in buildings and consequently to identify those areas where improvements can be made. It includes a series of activities such as pre-survey data collection, walk-through inspection, data collection, analysis of the data collected and formulation of energy efficiency solutions. Extensive data were collected including indoor condition monitoring, occupant feedback and utility usage. The occupant survey identified thermal discomfort in summer, reporting overheating, dry and stuffy conditions. Energy consumption in the case study building was found to be significantly less than the average consumption in the same suburb. Surprisingly, energy consumption was found to be more likely to be affected by housing tenure types than physical building conditions such as orientation and height. The impact of building materials on occupants and the provision of air conditioning systems in the individual unit need to be further researched to resolve overheating problems. It is recommended that not only the design and physical conditions of buildings but also the socio-economic status of building residents could be main factors to achieve a high level of energy efficiency in multi-residential buildings."

"Heatwaves, cooling and young children at home: Integrating energy and health objectives Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort This paper examines the practices advised by health authorities and performed by parents to cool infants during hot weather. The aim is to explore how health and energy efficiency imperatives can be better integrated for households. Consumption of home air conditioning is increasing around the world alongside policy concerns about energy poverty, climate change and peak demand. This paper analyses online sources containing advice to parents about temperature, hot weather and infant health. The content of this â€˜know-whatâ€™ for parents was considered alongside experience-based â€˜know-howâ€™ (Royston, 2014) as described by parents in 44 interviews and home tours in Australia. Air conditioning is frequently positioned by health authorities as superior to low or no energy practices. However, understandings of infant care during hot weather are diverse and unsettled âˆ’ both amongst parents and authorities. The absence of health sector consensus leaves space for energy policymakers to engage with the health sector to develop integrated cross-sectoral policy approaches. Continued circulation of adaptive, less energy-intensive hot weather practices is needed. Arresting the trajectory towards widespread reliance on air conditioning can help household finances, reduce electricity demand during hot weather, and avoid leaving parents ill-equipped when high demand or unexpected events compromise electricity supply."
"Hydrogenolysis of Lignin-Derived Aromatic Ethers over Heterogeneous Catalysts Bio-Oil; Catalyst; Guaiacol Global temperature has risen >1 Â°C since the preindustrial era, resulting in well-documented adverse climate impacts including extreme weather (floods, droughts, storms, and heat waves), a rise in sea level accompanying melting polar and glacial ice, and disrupted crop growth. These changes are closely correlated with anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, predominantly arising from the combustion of nonrenewable fossil fuels. Lignin derived from lignocellulose is the second most abundant biopolymer on Earth, and a rich source of renewable aromatic hydrocarbons to replace those currently obtained from fossil resources. Lignin depolymerization by cleavage of C-O and C-C linkages in the biopolymer can be achieved by direct pyrolysis or catalytic transformations, involving oxidation, hydrolysis, or hydrogenolysis reactions. Hydrogenolysis, in which H2 gas (or in-situ generated reactive H species) is supplied to lignin under relatively mild conditions, has attracted significant attention. This Perspective summarizes recent progress in the development of heterogeneous catalysts for the cleavage of C-O linkages in lignin-derived aromatic ethers by hydrogenolysis: It encompasses strategies using H2, hydrogen transfer, and photocatalysis for aromatic monomers production, and the determination of structure-activity relationships and underlying reaction mechanisms."

"The Australian energy transition as a federalism challenge: (Un)cooperative energy federalism? Renewable Portfolio Standard; Solar Energy Conversion; Green Certificates The law and regulation of the energy sector in Australia is subject to overlapping responsibilities of both federal and state governments. Crucially for energy transition efforts, neither energy, environment nor climate is mentioned in the Australian Constitution. Australia has a tradition of creative cooperative federalism solutions for responding to problems of national importance. In the energy sector this has resulted in an intricate national framework for energy markets, which relies on mirror legislation passed by participating states, with oversight by state and federal executive governments. Independently of these frameworks, both federal and state governments have passed climate change legislation, which crucially includes renewable energy support mechanisms. At a time when a rapid transition to a decarbonized energy system is essential, legal frameworks struggle to respond in a timely fashion. The political discourse around energy has become increasingly toxic â€“ reflecting a dysfunctional stateâ€“federal relationship in energy and climate law. Australia needs to consider whether its cooperative federalism solutions are sufficient to support the energy transition and how climate law at the state and federal levels interacts with energy market legal frameworks."
"Technology-Facilitated Domestic Violence Against Immigrant and Refugee Women: A Qualitative Study Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Help-Seeking Digital technologies are increasingly being used as tools for the perpetration of domestic violence. Little empirical research to date has explored the nature and impacts of technology-facilitated domestic violence (TFDV), and even less attention has been paid to the experiences of immigrant and refugee women. This article examines the nature and impacts of TFDV as experienced by immigrant and refugee women. Drawing on interviews with 29 victim-survivors and 20 stakeholders, we argue that although immigrant and refugee women may experience TFDV in similar ways to non-immigrant and refugee women, they face unique challenges, such as language barriers, cultural bias from support services, lack of financial resources, lack of trust in state institutions, and additional challenges with justice and migration systems. Immigrant and refugee women also face multiple structural layers of oppression and social inequality. Accordingly, we argue that a multifaceted approach is required to address TFDV that includes culturally sensitive and specific law reform, education, and training."

The survey on representative latest trends is presented."
"Indonesia in the spotlight: Combating corruption through ICT enabled governance Open Government; Transparency; E-Governance This paper puts Indonesia in the spotlight assessing the country's ability to combat corruption through ICT enabled governance. The research firstly tries to define governance through the different lens of intergovernmental organisations. This is followed by a comparative analysis of different situational characteristics of governance in developing and developed countries. The paper then explores the role of governance in Indonesia, highlighting the existing barriers, and potential drivers to the implementation of ICT in Indonesia. It is concluded that ICT enabled good governance needs to be in place to support the eradication of corruption in Indonesia. Corruption in Indonesia is considered systematic as the practice is prevalent across public organisations in the country. This study contributes to the information systems discipline by offering new insights into the issues of implementing ICT enabled open governance in developing countries such as Indonesia."

"Invasive weed species’ threats to global biodiversity: Future scenarios of changes in the number of invasive species in a changing climate Maximum Entropy; Ecosystem; Environmental Space Invasive weed species (IWS) threaten ecosystems, the distribution of specific plant species, as well as agricultural productivity. Predicting the impact of climate change on the current and future distributions of these unwanted species forms an important category of ecological research. Our study investigated 32 globally important IWS to assess whether climate alteration may lead to spatial changes in the overlapping of specific IWS globally. We utilized the versatile species distribution model MaxEnt, coupled with Geographic Information Systems, to evaluate the potential alterations (gain/loss/static) in the number of potential ecoregion invasions by IWS, under four Representative Concentration Pathways, which differ in terms of predicted year of peak greenhouse gas emission. We based our projection on a forecast of climatic variables (extracted from WorldClim) from two global circulation models (CCSM4 and MIROC-ESM). Initially, we modeled current climatic suitability of habitat, individually for each of the 32 IWS, identifying those with a common spatial range of suitability. Thereafter, we modeled the suitability of all 32 species under the projected climate for 2050, incorporating each of the four Representative Concentration Pathways (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) in separate models, again examining the common spatial overlaps. The discrimination capacity and accuracy of the model were assessed for all 32 IWS individually, using the area under the curve and true skill statistic rate, with results averaging 0.87 and 0.75 respectively, indicating a high level of accuracy. Our final methodological step compared the extent of the overlaps and alterations under the current and future projected climates. Our results mainly predicted decrease on a global scale, in areas of habitat suitable for most IWS, under future climatic conditions, excluding European countries, northern Brazil, eastern US, and south-eastern Australia. The following should be considered when interpreting these results: there are many inherent assumptions and limitations in presence-only data of this type, as well as with the modeling techniques projecting climate conditions, and the envelopes themselves, such as scale and resolution mismatches, dispersal barriers, lack of documentation on potential disturbances, and unknown or unforeseen biotic interactions."
"From me to us: Strengthening our Financial Capabilities Subjective Well-Being; Happiness; Life Satisfaction For low-income or precariously employed households in Australia, the re-allocation of risk over the past forty years has four crucial economic dimensions: the fraying of the social security net; changes in labour market dynamics; heightened uncertainty arising from income volatilities; and new hazards generated by the financialisation of daily life. Household financial capabilities are negatively influenced by the compounding impacts of each of these risks. Case examples from a BSL study illustrate each impact and their interactions. The dominant idea that individual capabilities are malleable (and thus can be optimised) whilst circumstances and norms are fixed is countered by an expanded view of Senâ€™s/Nussbaumâ€™s capability approach (CA) that includes collective capabilities. Collective capabilities can change norms, and so, the concept provides a needed link between the political and macroeconomic movement of risk re-allocation and individual or household financial capabilities. The Australian Unemployed Workersâ€™ Union is used as an example to show how collective action can challenge structural conditions, and expand or protect the capabilities of individuals."
"Bodies of/at Work: How Women of Colour Experienced Their Workplaces and Have Been Expected to ‘Perform’ During the COVID-19 Pandemic Intersectionality; Feminism; Social Location Almost 50 years ago, Edward Said wrote on â€˜the otherâ€™ in relation to race and gender in his path-breaking book Orientalism (1978). While much has evolved around notions of gendered and racialised otherness since then, Saidâ€™s conceptualisation still resonates today. Our paper reports on a 2020/2021 survey of Women of Colour in the Australian workplace. The survey was conducted during the pandemic by Women of Colour Australia, a not-for-profit group, working with the lead author. We focus on the qualitative answers from participants, many of which detail sometimes painful and extremely personal workplace experiences. More than 500 Women of Colour, including seven per cent who were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, completed the survey. Sixty per cent said they had experienced discrimination in the workplace, despite 59 per cent of participants saying their workplace had a Diversity and Inclusion policy. Participants had to â€˜performâ€™ their identities whilst being subjected to intersectional issues of racism and sexism, some of which the pandemic exacerbated. Our paper describes the harmful ramifications of gendered othering of Women of Colour for Australian organisations and society in the years of the pandemic."

"Metagenomics study in aquatic resource management: Recent trends, applied methodologies and future needs Metagenome; Binning; Bacteria Due to continuous anthropogenic activities and other natural changes, aquatic ecosystems are under increasing stress. Metagenomics aided by next-generation sequencing techniques provides in-depth insights into microbiome dynamics from multitude of aquatic resources thus contributes in understanding the physiological, metabolic, and ecological roles of microbial assemblies. Monitoring of diverse aquatic resources using metagenomics has the potential to efficiently characterize diverse range of microbiomes with relevant functional pathways. Contributions made by high-throughput second and third generation sequencing platforms are noteworthy in monitoring aquatic microbial biodiversity through characterization of genetic variations which is indicative of changing environmental adaptations. Analysis of sequence and function driven metagenomics enable elucidation of enzymatic pathways leading to the discovery of novel gene sequences with desired functions having ecological, industrial and pharmaceutical importance. This review seeks to define the role of metagenomics in exploring aquatic microbiota in terms of toxicological exposure, genome heterogeneity, assessment, and the management of aquatic ecosystem by utilizing microbial bio-indicators. We have also enlisted various high-throughput computational biology packages and tools exclusively used to handle metagenomic data along with the challenges and future perspectives. Owing to global climate change and massive human-induced alterations in aquatic ecosystems, we expect that the on-going whole-genome metagenomics studies in combination with â€œmeta-OMICSâ€ approaches would transform our comprehension of microbiome community structure, function and ecology at high resolution."

"Benevolent and hostile sexism differentially predicted by facets of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation Social Dominance Orientation; Authoritarianism; Political Attitudes Despite progress towards equality on many fronts, sexism remains a problem. If sexism is to be combatted, an understanding of the attitudes underlying its various expressions is required. Previous research has strongly linked sexism to right-wing authoritarianism (a preference for collective security) and social dominance orientation (a preference for group-based hierarchy). Both are often considered unitary constructs, however recent attention to their facets has revealed finer details. This study breaks ground by utilising these facets to predict benevolent sexism (paternalistic attitudes towards women) and hostile sexism (antipathy towards women) in an Australian sample (N = 229). Both sexism variables were significantly predicted by two of the five attitude facets. For benevolent sexism, these were traditionalism and dominance, and for hostile sexism, they were conservatism and anti-egalitarianism. Hostile sexism was also predicted by gender. These findings add to the theoretical understanding of ambivalent sexism, have implications for addressing sexism in society, and support calls for future research to utilise the facets of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation."

"Global research on carbon emissions: A scientometric review Structural Decomposition Analysis; Carbon Emissions; Material Flow Analysis Greenhouse gases such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon dioxide have been recognized as the prime cause of global climate change, which has received significant global attention. Among these gases, carbon dioxide is considered as the prominent gas which motivated researchers to explore carbon reduction and mitigation strategies. Research work on this domain expands from carbon emission reporting to identifying and implementing carbon mitigation and reduction strategies. A comprehensive study to map global research on carbon emissions is, however, not available. Therefore, based on a scientometric analysis method, this study reviewed the global literature on carbon emissions. A total of 2945 bibliographic records, from 1981 to 2019, were extracted from theWeb of Science core collection database and analyzed using techniques such as co-author and co-citation analysis. Findings revealed an increasing trend of publications in the carbon emission research domain, which has been more visible in the past few years, especially during 2016-2018. The most significant contribution to the domain was reported from China, the United States, and England. While most prolific authors and institutions of the domain were from China, authors and institutions from the United States reported the best connection links. It was revealed that evaluating greenhouse gas emissions and estimating the carbon footprint was popular among the researchers. Moreover, climate change and environmental effects of carbon emissions were also significant points of concern in carbon emission research. The key findings of this study will be beneficial for the policymakers, academics, and institutions to determine the future research directions as well as to identify with whom they can consult to assist in developing carbon emission control policies and future carbon reduction targets."

"Fire safety of composites in prefabricated buildings: From fibre reinforced polymer to textile reinforced concrete Fiberglass; Reinforced Concrete; Polymers Fibre reinforced composites (FRCs) have been increasingly used in the prefabricated building (PB) industry owing to its high strength-to-weight ratio, ease of application and flexibility in manufacturing. FRCs can be used in PBs for both structural and non-structural applications. The major hindrance for composite elements in PB is their fire performance. Depending on applications, there will be different requirements for FRCs on the fire resistance and vertical flame spread. There is limited information available to structural and faÃ§ade engineers/designers on fire safety of FRCs especially for PBs. Therefore, this paper provides the overview on the fire performance FRCs in PBs with a special focus on fibre reinforced polymer and textile reinforced concrete."

"An Anthropocene species of trouble? Negative synergies between earth system change and geological destratification Anthropocene; Climate Change; Environment Crisis It is already well understood that unbinding materials and energy from their lithic reservoirs impacts upon Earth systems. But that is just the first stage of a cycle of â€˜Anthropocene troubleâ€™. This paper tracks the multiple ways in which subsequent Earth system change reacts back upon the social infrastructures of subsurface exploitation and the landscapes they produce. Shifting fire regimes, intensifying hydrometeorological events and sea level rise impact upon the infrastructures of hydrocarbon extraction, hydroclimatic change impacts upon infrastructures and landscapes of mineral extraction, and both pyroclimatic and hydroclimatic change impact upon nuclear infrastructures and on landscapes already contaminated by radioactive materials. To make sense of these â€˜negative synergiesâ€™ we draw upon social science diagnoses of late modern hazards as well Anthropocene scienceâ€™s deepening collaboration between â€˜hard rockâ€™ geology and Earth system science."

"Nutrient removal by alginate-immobilized Chlorella vulgaris: response to different wastewater matrices Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water BACKGROUND: Immobilized algae are a promising tool to treat wastewater within a short time (<12 h) and simplify biomass harvesting compared with suspended algae. The potential of alginate-entrapped Chlorella vulgaris to bioremediate secondary (with and without nutrient supplementation), primary and two lagoon municipal wastewaters was investigated. The capability of the system to adapt to these wastewaters was analysed by determining biotic and abiotic nutrient removal, and further evaluated by comparison with suspended cells. RESULTS: The algal nitrogen (N) content (4.6â€“7.8 wt%) was closely related to the wastewater ammonium concentration (R2 = 0.97). The algal cells did not adapt N uptake as effectively to wastewater nitrate concentration because both abiotic N and phosphorus (P) removal increased. The algal P content (1.2â€“3.2 wt%) varied in response to the wastewater P and was inversely related to the initial cellular P content. The algae thus adapted nutrient uptake to the wastewater N:P level and ratio when ammonium predominated. Biomass production (35â€“73 mg L-1 d-1) increased with dissolved organic and inorganic carbon with little impact from other wastewater characteristics. Immobilization did not affect N and P uptake per cell compared with suspended algae. CONCLUSION: Decoupling biotic and abiotic removal showed adaptation to the N:P of the wastewater and luxury P uptake had significant impact during treatment of different wastewater matrices, these traits were not affected by immobilization. Immobilization enables increased N and P removal rates compared with suspended algal systems as nutrient uptake per cell is not affected and higher concentrations of algal biomass within the reactor are facilitated.

"Interactive arts and disability: A conceptual model toward understanding participation Education; Tabletop; Multi-Touch In this paper we explore how social aspects of group interaction and the physical affordances of interactive technology may be exploited to enhance the participation of people with a disability in creative, artistic activity. Participation per se is conceptualized using a current framework known as the family of Participation Related Constructsâ€”fPRC, an ecological approach derived from a biopsychosocial health model. Taking an integrative approach, we blend current theory on participation, interaction design and community art to explore how group play and performance can foster inclusive participation in the arts and contribute to a positive change in personal (and collective) wellbeing. We describe two interactive arts projects called Resonance and Wheelchair DJ that provide examples of participation and performance in communities with a disability and reflect upon the workshop models that facilitate the creative expression of individuals and the group. We conclude with a discussion on the potentially transformative effects of participation in the arts by people with a disability and our gaps in our understanding of how to evaluate the notion of participation as a meansâ€”a medium through which person-related attributes and creative activity are developed in the longer-term."
"Persistence of gender inequality: the role of ethnic divisions China; Institutional Quality; Multicultural Diversity Gender inequality remains a fundamental challenge for global policymakers given that it has detrimental implications for growth and human capital formation. However, studies examining the roots of gender inequality, and what determines the level of inequality are relatively scant. In this study, we seek to contribute to the literature that examines the roots of gender inequality and thus, our objective is to examine the impact of ethnic diversity on gender inequality. We argue that the level of ethnic diversity within a country plays a role in either deepening or bridging gender gaps. Using indices of ethnic fractionalization, we examine the effects of ethnic diversity on measures of gender inequality such as the gender inequality index, and its associated dimensions of empowerment, educational attainment and labour market outcomes. Our evidence suggests that ethnic diversity widens existing gender gaps. We discuss several mechanisms through which ethnic diversity may lead to the increase of existing gender gaps, and lay out various policy approaches to address gender inequality."

"Treatment of Industrial Wastewater in a Floating Treatment Wetland: A Case Study of Sialkot Tannery Constructed Wetlands; Waste Water; Nitrogen Removal The city of Sialkot in Pakistan is a hub of leather tanneries, with approximately 260 tanneries in operation and, while producing millions of leather products per day, the city discharges millions of gallons of untreated effluent into drains each day. In order to devise a cost-effective system for the treatment of tannery wastewater, a floating treatment wetland (FTW) was established to treat the effluent using local plant species through phytoremediation. The efficiency of the FTW was tested with three different plant species, each grown separately and operating for three months in the FTW tank. Two of the plant species introduced, water hyacinth and water lettuce, were floating and vascular; the third plant species Typha latifolia was vegetated on a floating mat of styrofoam while the roots extended down to the contaminated water. Wastewater from a tannery drain was pumped into the FTW tank with a flow of 0.5 L per minute and was given a retention time of six days. The influent and effluent from the FTW were periodically tested to determine the percentage removal of contaminants, primarily the total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and chromium. After two months with each species, a significant change in the quality of wastewater was measured: chromium was removed by up to 95 percent by the water hyacinth and water lettuce and 33 percent by the Typha latifolia. The pilot model indicates that FTWs are an effective system to treat effluent from tanneries in a cost-effective way as an alternative to establishing an expensive treatment system with high associated operational costs. It can help in achieving the circular economy concept of conventional wastewater schemes towards more sustainable ones. Moreover, to achieve the principles of circular economy and environmentally friendly development, it is crucial that the substances used for a wetland foundation have the capacity to be recycled, are available at a cheap price, and are locally available."
"A review of the use of radiocarbon to estimate groundwater residence times in semi-arid and arid areas Noble Gases; Tracers; Groundwater Groundwater is an important resource in arid and semi-arid regions and determining its residence times is critical for sustainable use. Radiocarbon (14C) is currently the primary geochemical tracer for determining residence times of regional groundwater systems. The analysis of 14C contents of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) became more straightforward following the development of accelerator mass spectrometry, which has led to an increase in the number of studies using 14C. However, the interpretation of 14C data is not always straightforward and many studies consider relatively few of the multiple processes that may affect the 14C contents of DIC in groundwater. Commonly, studies have focussed on correcting 14C contents for closed-system dissolution of 14C-free calcite, which is a near-ubiquitous process. However, especially in semi-arid and arid areas, uncertainties in the initial 14C contents and Î´13C values of recharge due to the presence of low-14C soil CO2 in the deep unsaturated zone, recharge by rivers, or open-system calcite dissolution pose problems for mass balance calculations. Additionally, processes such as methanogenesis and mineralisation of organic carbon may be locally important. Most studies also assume a constant atmospheric 14C content and non-dispersive piston flow in aquifers, which results in residence times being underestimated and makes it difficult to compare the groundwater archive to other palaeoclimate or palaeoenvironment records. Additionally, mixing of water within aquifers, diffusion of 14C between low and high permeability layers, and sampling from multiple units in long-screen wells may limit whether a meaningful residence time can be determined. Overall, while it is relatively straightforward to estimate broad ranges of residence times or determine general patterns of groundwater flow, the quest to quantify residence times, flow rates, and recharge remains a challenge. The use of multiple radioactive tracers, better characterisation of Î´13C values and 14C contents of the potential sources of DIC, and more critical assessment of flow systems will improve the utilisation of this important tracer."
"Botswana teachers: competencies perceived as important for inclusive education Inclusive Education; Special Educational Needs; Psychological Practice The implementation of inclusive education continues to pose challenges to teachers world-wide and Botswana is no exception. This study aimed to explore the teaching competencies general education teachers in Botswana primary schools perceived as important to their teaching in inclusive classrooms. Using a quantitative research approach, 116 general education primary school teachers completed a 14-Item questionnaire titled Perceived Competencies for Inclusive Teaching Scale, and an open-ended question about the supportive resources they required to be effective in their classrooms. Descriptive statistics, ANOVA and t-tests were used to analyse the data. The results of this study showed that participants identified adaptive instructional competencies (including setting curricula goals, modifying learning content and teaching to the different learning styles of students) as most important. Human resources (teacher aides, specialist teachers,) followed by material resources were seen to be key support resources required for them to be able to implement IE. This study could be used as a baseline for future research on key competencies and resources for primary school teachers for inclusive education."
"Combining phytoextraction by Brassica napus and biochar amendment for the remediation of a mining soil in Riotinto (Spain) Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Soil contamination in mining areas is an important environmental concern. In these areas, phytoremediation is often impeded because of the low fertility and pH. Assisted phytoremediation is increasingly being used in polluted areas. Biochar could assist plant growth via enhanced soil fertility. An experiment was performed in a mining soil (RIII) from the mining area of Riotinto (Spain) contaminated with Cu, Pb, Zn and As in order to study: (i) The effects of biochar on soil fertility; (ii) Biochar temperature of preparation effect and (iii) Effect of biochar on phytoremediation potential. A mesocosm experiment was designed using Brassica napus as test specie. Soil (RIII) was treated with rabbit manure biochars prepared at 450 Â°C (BM450) and 600 Â°C (BM600) at a rate of 10% in mass and incubated for 60 days with or without Brassica napus. Results showed that the combination of BM450 or BM600 with Brassica napus growth decreased the amount of As, Cu, Co, Cr, Se and Pb in the soil. Values of bioaccumulation factor (BAF) for Cd were particularly elevated (>10) in the unamended soil and reached values higher than 1 for other elements, indicating the potential of Brassica napus to accumulate several heavy metals. Translocation Factor (TF) was reduced for Co, Cr, Cd, Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb and As after biochar addition indicating root accumulation of these metals. In all cases, biochar addition increased biomass production. Finally, the addition of BM450 increased GMea index indicating also an improvement on soil quality."
"Development of Evacuation Management Tool for Rail Transport (student: Alejandro Tamani) The aim of this project is to develop an evacuation management tool for underground railway transportation systems, which include underground stations, tunnels and railway carriages. The safe and efficient movement of passengers during an evacuation in underground railway transportation systems is a major public safety concern as s light delays can have very adverse effects on the number of deaths and injuries in a real emergency. The tool that will be developed in this study will enable to develop appropriate strategy and design solutions to minimise the delays in the evacuation process, thereby reducing injury and improving chances of survival in an emergency. Previous studies on evacuation in underground railway transportation systems have shown that there is a lack of evacuation management tool that replicates passengers' likely behaviour, aids way-finding and directs people to safe locations in an emergency situation in an integrated way by considering the complex and confusing layout of underground train station, train carriages and train tunnel. The development of an evacuation management tool in this project will address these issues by understanding passengers' perceptions and awareness of the emergency signs and communication tools, way finding tools and cues, and their likely behaviours at underground station, train carriages and tunnel in an integrated way. This information will then be used to develop an evacuation simulation model that is specific to underground rail transport. "

restriction due to placental insufficiency. EPE has life-threatening and lifelong consequences for both the mother and baby. Despite its severity
and long term impacts, there is still no effective way to treat EPE other than premature delivery. The reason for the lack of therapies is partly due
to the complexity of the syndrome, and partly because the underlying causes are not well understood."

"Handling complexity in animal and plant science research—From single to functional traits: Are we there yet? Biomarkers; Hippuric Acid; Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy The current knowledge of the main factors governing livestock, crop and plant quality as well as yield in different species is incomplete. For example, this can be evidenced by the persistence of benchmark crop varieties for many decades in spite of the gains achieved over the same period. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that molecular breeding based on DNA markers has led to advances in breeding (animal and crops). However, these advances are not in the way that it was anticipated initially by the researcher in the field. According to several scientists, one of the main reasons for this was related to the evidence that complex target traits such as grain yield, composition or nutritional quality depend on multiple factors in addition to genetics. Therefore, some questions need to be asked: are the current approaches in molecular genetics the most appropriate to deal with complex traits such as yield or quality? Are the current tools for phenotyping complex traits enough to differentiate among genotypes? Do we need to change the way that data is collected and analysed?"

"Varied Magnetic Phases in a van der Waals Easy-Plane Antiferromagnet Revealed by Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Microscopy Ferromagnetic Material; Ferromagnetism; Magnets Interest in van der Waals materials often stems from a desire to miniaturize existing technologies by exploiting their intrinsic layered structures to create near-atomically thin components that do not suffer from surface defects. One appealing property is an easily switchable yet robust magnetic order, which is only sparsely demonstrated in the case of in-plane anisotropy. In this work, we use widefield nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetic imaging to measure the properties of individual flakes of CuCrP2S6, a multiferroic van der Waals magnet known to exhibit weak easy-plane anisotropy in the bulk. We chart the crossover between the in-plane ferromagnetism in thin flakes down to the trilayer and the bulk behavior dominated by a low-field spin-flop transition. Further, by exploiting the directional dependence of NV center magnetometry, we are able to observe an instance of a predominantly out-of-plane ferromagetic phase near zero field, in contrast with our expectation and previous experiments on the bulk material. We attribute this to the presence of surface anisotropies caused by the sample preparation process or exposure to the ambient environment, which is expected to have more general implications for a broader class of weakly anisotropic van der Waals magnets."
"Ordered intracrystalline pores in planar molybdenum oxide for enhanced alkaline hydrogen evolution Catalyst; Cobalt Phosphide; Water Splitting Molybdenum based compounds are an emerging class of non-metallic catalytic materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. However, most of them lose considerable catalytic performance and exhibit poor long-term stability in alkaline media. Here, planar molybdenum oxide, with high alkaline stability and ordered intracrystalline pores, is developed as the HER candidate. The pores with diameters in the order of âˆ¼5-7 Ã… are HER-active, and appear after an NH 4 + doping-driven phase transition from the orthorhombic to hexagonal phase. Such a unique structure facilitates the diffusion of ionic entities and water molecules to the HER sites and helps in the removal of gaseous products, therefore improving the surface active area and reaction kinetics. These intracrystalline pores also reduce the long term stress on electrodes. The corresponding HER activity is extremely stable for >40 h in an alkaline medium at an overpotential of 138 mV with a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec -1 . Such properties offer a superior combination compared to those of other reported molybdenum based nanostructures, hence providing a great opportunity for developing high-performance alkaline non-metal HER catalysts."

"How positive service experiences contribute to service captivity Debt; Personal Finance; Credit Cards Purpose: Service captivity is described as the experience of constrained choice whereby a consumer has no power and feels unable to exit a service relationship. This study aims to explore how positive service experiences can contribute to service captivity in the alternative financial services (AFS) sector for consumers experiencing financial vulnerability. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 31 interviews were undertaken with Australian consumers of payday loans and/or consumer leases. Findings: The authors reveal a typology of consumers based on their financial vulnerability and their experience with AFS providers. Then they present three themes relating to how the marketing practices of these providers create a positive service experience, and, in doing so, can contribute to service captivity for consumers experiencing financial vulnerability. Research limitations/implications: The benefits derived from positive service experiences, including accessible solutions, self-esteem, and a sense of control over their financial situation, contribute to the service captivity of some consumers, rendering alternative avenues less attractive. Practical implications: AFS providers must ensure a socially responsible approach to their marketing practices to minimize potentially harmful outcomes for consumers. However, a systems-level approach is needed to tackle the wider issue of financial precarity. Policymakers need to address the marketplace gaps, regulatory frameworks and social welfare policies that contribute to both vulnerability and captivity. Originality/value: This research extends the understanding of service captivity by demonstrating how positive service experiences can perpetuate this situation. Further, specific solutions are proposed at each level of the service system to address service captivity in the AFS sector."
"Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid Enhanced Membrane Bioreactor (eMBR) System Treating Synthetic Textile Effluent Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling The textile industry produces a high volume of wastewater rich in toxic and harmful chemicals. Therefore, it is necessary to apply wastewater treatment methods such as membrane bioreactor (MBR) to achieve high efficiency, process stability, small footprint, and low maintenance costs. This work performed a study on a synthetic textile wastewater treatment using an enhanced membrane bioreactor (eMBR) equipped with two anoxic and one aerobic reactor and a UV disinfection unit. The results showed 100% removal of total suspended solids, 81.8% removal of chemical oxygen demand, and 96% removal of color. The SEM analysis indicated that the pores of the membrane were blocked by a compact and dense gel layer, as observed by the presence of the fouling layer. According to these results, an eMBR hybrid system is a suitable option for treating synthetic textile wastewater. Opportunities to increase the efficiencies in the removal of some pollutants, as well as stabilizing and standardizing the process are the improvements which require further investigations."

"Marine Protists and Rhodotorula Yeast as Bio-Convertors of Marine Waste into Nutrient-Rich Deposits for Mangrove Ecosystems Schizochytrium; Labyrinthulida; Docosahexaenoic Acid This paper represents a comprehensive study of two new thraustochytrids and a marine Rhodotorula red yeast isolated from Australian coastal waters for their abilities to be a potential renewable feedstock for the nutraceutical, food, fishery and bioenergy industries. Mixotrophic growth of these species was assessed in the presence of different carbon sources: glycerol, glucose, fructose, galactose, xylose, and sucrose, starch, cellulose, malt extract, and potato peels. Up to 14 g DW/L (4.6 gDW/L-day and 2.8 gDW/L-day) of biomass were produced by Aurantiochytrium and Thraustochytrium species, respectively. Thraustochytrids biomass contained up to 33% DW of lipids, rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6, 124 mg/g DW); up to 10.2 mg/gDW of squalene and up to 61 Î¼g/gDW of total carotenoids, composed of astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, echinenone, and Î²-carotene. Along with the accumulation of these added-value chemicals in biomass, thraustochytrid representatives showed the ability to secrete extracellular polysaccharide matrixes containing lipids and proteins. Rhodotorula sp lipids (26% DW) were enriched in palmitic acid (C16:0, 18 mg/gDW) and oleic acid (C18:1, 41 mg/gDW). Carotenoids (87 Î¼g/gDW) were mainly represented by Î²-carotene (up to 54 Î¼g/gDW). Efficient growth on organic and inorganic sources of carbon and nitrogen from natural and anthropogenic wastewater pollutants along with intracellular and extracellular production of valuable nutrients makes the production of valuable chemicals from isolated species economical and sustainable."

"Application of COVID-19 single-use shredded nitrile gloves in structural concrete: Case study from Australia Rubber Waste; Vulcanized Elastomers; Rubber The use of single-use nitrile gloves has been on a sharp incline since the Coronavirus pandemic first started in late 2019. This led to a significant increase in the generation of this clinical waste that requires various recycling solutions to reduce its environmental impact from disposal or incineration. This paper explores its application in structural concrete by adding shredded nitrile gloves at 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% of the volume of concrete. The compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and SEM-EDS analysis were undertaken to ascertain the effect of different concentrations of shredded nitrile gloves on the mechanical properties, quality of concrete, and its bond performance with the cement matrix. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of up to 0.2% of shredded nitrile gloves can provide ~22% improvement in the compressive strength of blended concrete composites at 28-days of curing. In comparison, the inclusion of 0.3% of shredded nitrile gloves shows improvements of ~20% in compressive strength at 28-days. The SEM-EDS analysis shows a very good bond formation between the nitrile rubber and the cement matrix with no gap identified in the interfacial transition zone (ITZ)."
"Managing bullying in the workplace: a model of servant leadership, employee resilience and proactive personality Mobbing; Incivility; Nurses Purpose: This paper develops and tests a model for managing workplace bullying by integrating employee perceived servant leadership, resilience and proactive personality. Specifically, this paper explores servant leadership as an inhibitive factor for workplace bullying, both directly and indirectly in the presence of employee resilience as a mediator. It further explores whether proactive personality moderates the indirect relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This is an empirical study based on analysis of survey data collected from 408 employees working in services and manufacturing sector organisations in Pakistan. Structural equation modelling was used to test the research model. Findings: Structural equation modelling results support the proposition that servant leadership helps in discouraging workplace bullying, both directly and indirectly, in the presence of employee resilience as a mediator. However, employee proactive personality moderates this process, such that the association between resilience and workplace bullying is stronger for individuals with high proactive personality. Research limitations/implications: This study's findings illuminate the strong potential of servant leadership for managing workplace bullying. This potential is attributed to positive role modelling in the workplace, which may assist in building followers' resilience. This study provides evidence to support the importance of leadership in the process by which employees develop better psychological resources to combat bullying at work. Originality/value: This is the first study that examines the direct relationship between servant leadership and bullying at work. In addition, this study introduced the mediating effect of resilience and the moderating effect of proactive personality on this relationship."
"Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic cuttlebone with an inherent lamellar structure for continuous and effective oil spill cleanup Water; Hydrophobicity; Aerogels Oil wastes pose an enormous threat to aquatic ecosystems, and environmental and economic demands emphasize the importance of affordable and sustainable oil absorbents. To tackle this issue, we propose the repurposing of abundant and low-cost cuttlebone from the ocean to address oil spills for the ocean. By the simple, successive deposition of polydopamine and a mixture of fluorinated silica nanoparticles and polydimethylsiloxane, the ultralight, porous, and mechanically stable cuttlebone is endowed with excellent superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity. The as-obtained cuttlebone exhibits high absorption performance for various hydrocarbons and is successfully applied in a series of oil/water mixture separations. On this basis, an oil-collecting â€œcephalopodâ€ electric device is designed by combining superhydrophobic/superoleophilic cuttlebone with a pumping system, and demonstrates excellent collection efficiency and recyclability for oil spill cleanup. This work provides a valuable perspective on the development of high-performance oil absorbents derived from sustainable natural marine products."

Roads were evaluated and sorted using the utility function. The paper achieved a hierarchical division of road network using the sample clustering analysis method, showed the basic process of the hierarchical division method through an example, and provided the basis for the identification of the critical points of the road network in future."
"Distributed, privacy-enhancing technologies in the 2017 Catalan referendum on independence: New tactics and models of participatory democracy Social Movements; Protest; Austerity This paper ex amines new civic engagement practices unfolding during the 2017 referendum on independence in Catalonia. These practices constitute one of the first signs of some emerging trends in the use of the Internet for civic and political action: the adoption of horizontal, distributed, and privacy-enhancing technologies that rely on P2P networks and advanced cryptographic tools. In this regard, the case of the 2017 Catalan referendum, framed within conflicting political dynamics, can be considered a first-of-its kind in participatory democracy. The case also offers an opportunity to reflect on an interesting paradox that twenty-first century activism will face: the more it will rely on private-friendly, secured, and encrypted networks, the more open, inclusive, ethical, and transparent it will need to be."
"Low-energy housing as a means of improved social housing: Benefits, challenges and opportunities Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Rising energy costs are significantly impacting low-income households. These households can struggle to pay their utility bills, and/or self-ration how much energy they consume which impacts on liveability within the home, such as the provision of appropriate thermal comfort. While incremental progress is being made in terms of improving the energy efficiency of housing in many developed countries, such improvements are typically inaccessible to low-income or social housing tenants. This chapter presents outcomes of a multi-year evaluation of a cohort of low-energy social housing from Horsham in regional Victoria, Australia. The analysis includes technical performance data and is supplemented with the occupantsâ€™ own stories about improved liveability outcomes. It is clear that the evidence supports aspirations by the state housing agency, which owns and maintains the housing, to move beyond their current minimum housing standards for new construction. A combination approach, whereby the thermal performance of the dwelling is improved, in addition to including renewable energy generation, will address several goals of social (or public) housing providersâ€”namely improving quality of life, health outcomes, finances and poverty. In addition, such housing will help them achieve organisational or broader government sustainability goals such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel energy consumption."
"Banking in the Shadows: A Comparative Study of China and India Shadow Economy; Informality; Informal Sector In recent years there has been increasing interest in the rise of shadow banking in China and India. In this paper, we aim to get a better understanding of the differences in trends and investigate the factors leading to the increase of shadow banking in these two major emerging economies. We find that financial exclusion is a common factor leading to the growth of shadow banking in both countries. While financial reform has taken place in India, financially repressive policies still prevail in China. Although several regulatory measures have been adopted in India and China, the size of the shadow banking sector in these two countries remains underestimated. Thus, streamlining and enhancing data collection is a key priority for both nations. We argue that regulation in both countries should be more activity focused (specific field in which a shadow bank is focused on) rather than sector or entity based, and it should be at par with banks. The shadow banks provide last mile connectivity to remote, distant, and ignored segments of the population not serviced by the formal financial sector. As this enhances financial inclusion, a balanced approach is required keeping in view both costs and benefits of the shadow banking system."
"The politics of biodiversity offsetting across time and institutional scales Conservation Banking; Environmental Protection; Compensatory Measure Biodiversity offsettingâ€”actions aimed to produce biodiversity gains to compensate for development impactsâ€”has become an important but controversial instrument of sustainability governance. To understand how this occurred, we conducted a discourse analysis, iteratively applying a qualitative coding system to 197 policy documents produced between 1958 and 2019 across four institutional scales. We show that offsetting has historically been promoted by reformist approaches, which encourage economic growth without consideration of biocultural limits. More recently, those promoting more transformative approaches have reinterpreted offsetting as an instrument to transition towards sustainable economies respectful of planetary boundaries. However, we show that enacting this approach requires major structural governance changes that challenge the dominance of reformist coalitions across scales. Such changes would need to include a commitment by institutions to renounce non-essential projects and avoid damage and for offset stakeholders to become aware of how their contributions become enrolled in the service of specific discourses. Without such changes, offsetting risks structurally encouraging conservationists to produce natures compatible with a status quo development, rather than to advance transformative practices for biocultural diversity."

"Naturopathy in Australia: Where are we now? Where are we heading? Complementary and Alternative Medicine; Alternative Medicine; Mind-Body Therapies Naturopathy is the general practice of natural therapies. It emphasizes prevention, treatment, and promotion of optimal health through therapeutic modalities which encourage the self-healing process of the body. Formalized in the 19th century by the hydrotherapy and nature cure movement in Austria and Germany, naturopathy was introduced to Australia at the turn of the 20th century. It became popular since the 1970s due to social and cultural change characterized by the post-modern philosophy, as well as government policies highlighting individual responsibility and freedom of choice. Naturopathy is one of the most popular forms of complementary medicine in Australia today with naturopaths received 4.9 million consultations annually. Naturopathic consultations are sought for a variety of conditions and, in some areas, as a form of primary care, especially by middle-aged women who have a higher education level and a higher annual income. The number of Australian naturopaths was estimated to be over 4000 in 2017 and expects to grow to over 4600 by 2022, although this number is likely to be an underestimation. Australian naturopaths, as a predominantly female profession, work mainly in private clinical practice with nutritional medicine, herbal medicine, homeopathy, as well as massage therapies being the most common modalities used. There are also signs of greater integration with community pharmacies and integrative medicine clinics in major cities. The Bachelor's degree programs in Naturopathy has just become the only accredited entry-level qualification since late 2015. Currently, there are only 5 private colleges offering naturopathic education, a far cry from the 40 over in mid-2000. The profession continues to be self-regulated. There is no barrier of entry to practice and unqualified practitioners of naturopathy can potentially do harm to the public. The registration of naturopaths remains unresolved due to fragmented representation under many professional associations, disunity among the profession, and objections by certain health care lobbyists. There is a dearth of research demonstrating efficacy of the whole practice of naturopathy in Australia, which has directed the government's decision to withdraw it from private health insurance coverage from 2019. Moving forward, the whole system research of naturopathy in Australia will be in focus with the recent establishment of a practice-based research network and an international research consortium. With increasing scrutiny from evidence-based medicine, the present and future challenge to Australian naturopaths is centered on the integration of both scientific and traditional evidence to form the foundation of a person-centered, evidence-informed practice."
"The uneven distribution of futurity: Slow emergencies and the event of COVID-19 Biopolitics; Governmentality; Disaster The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic strains conventional temporal imaginaries through which emergencies are typically understood and governed. Rather than a transparent and linear temporality, a smooth transition across the series event/disruptionâ€“responseâ€“post-event recovery, the pandemic moves in fits and starts, blurring the boundary between normalcy and emergency. This distended temporality brings into sharp relief other slow emergencies such as racism, poverty, biodiversity loss, and climate change, which inflect how the pandemic is known and governed as an emergency. In this article, we reflect on COVID-19 responses in two settler colonial societiesâ€”Australia and the United Statesâ€”to consider how distinct styles of pandemic responses in each context resonate and dissonate across the racially uneven distribution of futurity that structures liberal order. In each case, the event of COVID-19 has indeed opened a window that reveals multiple slow emergencies; yet in these and other responses this revelation is not leading to meaningful changes to address underlying forms of structural violence. In Australia and the United States, we see how specific slow emergenciesâ€”human-induced climate change and anti-Black violence in White supremacist societies, respectivelyâ€”become intensified as liberal order recalibrates itself in response to the event of COVID-19."
"It takes a family to lighten the load! The impact of family-to-business support on the stress and creativity of women micro-entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka Psychological Capital; Work Engagement; Personnel Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether family-to-business support acts as a job resource that attenuates the negative effects of work demands on the stress and creativity of women micro-entrepreneurs in the informal sector in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 359 women micro-entrepreneurs and their respective case officers in local government were used to test the hypothesized relationship between work demands and their creativity through the mediating mechanism of stress and the moderating effect of family-to-business support on the said relationship. Findings: Work demands reduced creativity through heightening the levels of stress faced by women micro-entrepreneurs. However, family-to-business support reduced the negative influence of work demands on creativity through stress. Practical implications: Women micro-entrepreneurs should build strong family ties to obtain support from family members. In addition, government training programs that target women micro-entrepreneurs should be extended to include their immediate family members. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature by examining whether family-to-business support buffers the negative effects of work demands for women micro-entrepreneurs in the informal sector. In doing so it makes a theoretical contribution by testing the key tenets of the JD-R model in entrepreneurial settings."

"Experience learning from low-carbon pilot provinces in China: Pathways towards carbon neutrality Divisia Index; Logarithmic Mean; Carbon Emissions As one of the largest carbon emitters worldwide, China has promised to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve national carbon neutrality by 2060. In order to achieve the carbon reduction goal, the low-carbon pilot (LCP) program has been implemented in China since 2010. It is particularly significant to recognise the effectiveness of the LCP program and learn valuable experience from these LCP provinces. Therefore, this study develops a systemic experience learning approach by analysing the evolution of carbon footprint (CF) and net carbon footprint (NCF) and investigating the impact factors in representative LCP provinces. The results demonstrated that the CF of nine LCP provinces showed an upward trend from 2006 to 2015, and the NCF of eight provinces was larger than 0 except for Yunnan province, with a negative NCF. The implementation of the LCP program is effective since the average annual growth rates of CF and NCF in pilot provinces were significantly lower after they were selected as LCP provinces. Based on the identified four impact factors of CF (i.e., population, GDP per capita, industrial structure, and technology), the low-carbon experience with regional characteristics can be summarised and shared with other regions throughout the country. Accordingly, targeted guidelines are put forward from the perspectives of policy, industry structure, population, and carbon uptake. This study not only develops a new experience learning approach incorporating the regional characteristics but also provides effective pathways towards carbon neutrality."

"Improving drought resilience in Northern Murray-Darling Basin farming communities: Is forecast-based financing suitable? Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China A trend towards drier conditions during the April to October â€˜coolâ€™ season across southern Australia has been observed in the past few decades. Frequent and prolonged droughts have a significant impact on the financial stability of affected farming communities. Forecast-based Financing (FbF) is a novel proactive aid approach that provides support measures to increase resilience during the window between drought early warnings, and the actual onset and intensification of drought. Using the Northern Murray-Darling Basin as a case study, we investigated whether FbF combined with a user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought has the potential to increase the drought resilience of Australian farming communities. This study shows that farming businesses most impacted by drought have three common factors: (i) lower levels of business management skills, (ii) lower levels of pre-drought preparedness during non-drought periods, and (iii) slower responses when the intensity of drought increases. The results suggest that FbF in its current form is not recommended for a market economy such as Australia, as forms of direct assistance may have adverse long-term effects through disrupting the market itself and may not encourage farm operators to regularly assess and adapt their drought management strategies. Results also suggest that providing farmers, service providers, and all levels of government with tools that incorporate a user-centred I-EWS for drought can improve overall decision-making before, during, and even after drought. This change from a reactive to a proactive approach to managing drought impacts can be a highly effective form of increasing the drought resilience of farming communities."
"Sustainable development goals and indicators for circular built environment: regional comparison based on a global survey Industrial Symbiosis; Sustainable Development; Circular Economy This paper presents results from an empirical study about the interplay between circular built environment (CBE) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

"Gelatin/β–Cyclodextrin Bio–Nanofibers as respiratory filter media for filtration of aerosols and volatile organic compounds at low air resistance Air Filters; Electrospinning; Nanofibers Air pollution is a universal concern. The suspended solid/liquid particles in the air and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are ubiquitous. Synthetic polymer-based air filter media not only has disposal issues but also is a source of air and water pollution at the end of their life cycle. It has been a challenge to filter both particulate matter and VOC pollutants by a common biodegradable filter media having low air resistance. This study reports gelatin/Î²â€“cyclodextrin composite nanofiber mats with dual function air filtration ability at reduced air resistance (148 Pa) and low basis weight (1 g/mÂ²). Gelatin/Î²â€“cyclodextrin nanofibers captured aerosols (0.3â€“5 Î¼m) with < 95% filtration efficiency at 0.029/Pa quality factor. They adsorbed great amount of xylene (287 mg/g), benzene (242 mg/g), and formaldehyde (0.75 mg/g) VOCs. VOC adsorption of gelatin/Î²â€“cyclodextrin nanofibers is found several times higher than a commercial face mask and pristine powder samples. This study provides a solution for a â€˜greenâ€™ dual function respiratory air filtration at low resistance. Gelatin/Î²â€“cyclodextrin nanofibers also have the potential to filter nano-sized viruses."
"The health of Victoria's marine mammals: ecotoxicology and biomarker
assessment (Lead CI: PhD student Ms Chantel Foord) Marine ecosystems are under major threat from the anthropogenic release of chemical pollutants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and trace metals. Marine mammals are used globally as sentinels for ecosystem health and function, as top-order predators with long life-cycles they provide information on the bio-accumulation and magnification of toxicants within the ecosystems in which they live. Further, elevated levels of contaminants such as POPs and trace metals have been linked to adverse effects on the reproduction, endocrine and immune systems in marine mammals world-wide. "
"Highly Selective CO2 Gas Sensing Properties of CaO-BaTiO3 Heterostructures Effectuated through Discretely Created n-n Nanointerfaces Carbon Dioxide; Work Functions; Gas Globally recognized for its role as an occupational hazard, carbon dioxide (CO2) detection and monitoring is essential in agriculture, chemical manufacturing, and healthcare/clinical-oriented applications. Although, optical and chemical gas sensors are available commercially, current gas sensing technologies involving selective monitoring of CO2 at lower detection limits specifically for industrial conditions still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a simple strategy for highly selective CO2 detection using an inexpensive transducer platform based on reversible chemisorbed carbonation between CO2 and CaO-BaTiO3 heterostructures. Microsensors showed an optimum sensitivity of 65% toward 1000 ppm of CO2 gas and superior selectivity when operated at 160 Â°C. Such a remarkable sensing performance originates from the discretely created n-n nanointerfaces and conveniently actualized staggered energy band positions that promote favorable charge transfer upon exposure to CO2 gas molecules even at parts per million levels. Reversible sensing phenomenon is demonstrated using operando time-resolved diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and correlated with energy band alignment determined from the ultraviolet diffuse reflectance (UV-DRS) spectra to propose the sensing mechanism."
"Measuring the inequality of accessible trams in Melbourne Public Transport; Accessibility; Transit In Melbourne, public policy has recently been enacted to improve access to the tram service with an emphasis upon people with a disability. Achieving that objective requires two elements. One is a low-floor tram and two is an elevated tram stop platform that facilitates boarding the tram. Currently the fleet of trams in Melbourne is made up of high-floor and low-floor designs, thus accessible services are unevenly distributed. In addition, construction of new tram stop platforms has been uneven. This suggests a form of inequality in accessible tram services for the disabled. Several studies of transport services have addressed this issue using the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve calculations as seen in studies of disadvantaged groups such as the elderly. This research utilizes those approaches to estimate the current access of the disabled population to trams services in Melbourne. The approach compares the geography of the total and accessible tram services with the geography of the total and disabled population using the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve. The results show that there is inequality in the accessible trams amongst people with a disability in Melbourne (Gini = 0.66) as 70% of the disabled population has access to only 22% of the accessible tram supply. In comparison, considering the total tram supply and the entire population, (Gini = 0.48) 70% of the population shares 40% of the tram supply. Hence, at this stage the provision of accessible tram services for people with a disability falls well below that of the general population. These results provide an insight into the current tram service inequality and can be used as a reference for future tram system investment. Further, the approach could be used to increase awareness of this matter and encourage an inclusive and sustainable public transport planning and development in both local and global contexts."

"Novel magnetically induced healing in road pavements Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Self-Healing Around the globe, maintenance costs to repair asphalt roads during their service life often exceed the available budget of road authorities and municipalities.This chapter explores novel approaches to generate engineered healing capabilities through induction heating of ferrous material-asphalt composites. These include ferromagnetic fillers, ferrous fibers, mixed-metal alloy fibers, and recycled fibers from shredded vehicle tires, among others.This approach is expected to contribute in decreasing the amount of maintenance needed for road pavements by extending their service life and promoting microcracks closure (healing).Experimental results showed that the temperature of the composite samples increased under the alternative magnetic field, reaching high-temperature values in a very small amount of time, hence promoting a rapid closure of microcracks in asphalt."
"The Intergenerational Impacts of War: Bombings and Child Labour in Vietnam Infant Health; War Exposure; Child Health While adverse consequences of war for the generation who lived through the conflict have been well documented in the literature, the intergenerational impacts of war have received far less attention. We provide causal evidence on the impact of bombings during the Vietnam War on the prevalence of child labour among second-generation Vietnamese, defined as those born after the Vietnam War. Our preferred results, which instrument for bombing intensity using distance to the 17th parallel north latitude, suggest that a 10% increase in the intensity of bombings generates a 1.9 percentage point increase in the probability that a child worked in the last 12 months. This result is robust to several checks. We examine several potential channels and find that this relationship is mediated through household poverty."

"Developing the resilient project professional: examining the student experience Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management Purpose: Resilience development during university can increase the likelihood of positive employment outcomes for project management graduates in what is known as a stressful profession where the prevalence of project failure, job insecurity, and burnout is high. However, a focus on student resilience in project management education is scarce. The purpose of this paper is to address this gap by establishing a baseline profile of resilience for project management students, identifying priority areas of resilience development and exploring the relationship between resilience and well-being. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 292 Australian students undertaking project management studies completed a survey comprising of the Resilience at University scale, the Short Warwickâ€“Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale and an item assessing sleep adequacy. Findings: A resilience profile for undergraduate, postgraduate, male and female project management students was calculated. The resilience profile identified differences according to gender, and between undergraduate and postgraduate students. Mental well-being and adequate sleep were found to be significantly related to resilience. Practical implications: Findings support the call for a greater emphasis on resilience development in the project management curriculum for undergraduates and postgraduates. One priority area likely to facilitate resilience is the ability to maintain perspective. As well as supporting academic achievement, it will assist graduates to navigate through complex, uncertain and challenging project environments. Originality/value: This is the first known study of resilience for students undertaking project management studies in higher education."

"Women as helpmates: the Japan Self-Defense Forces and gender Flexible Work; Japan; Symbolic Interactionism As the Japan Self-Defense Forces becomes â€˜closerâ€™ to everyday people, discourses surrounding military masculinities and femininities shift. This paper takes a â€˜curious feministâ€™ approach to the shifting significance of the JSDF and asks the question, â€˜What can the changing JSDF tell us about its relationship with women?â€™ I explore representations of women and men in three JSDF-related publicationsâ€“a matchmaking website that caters to male soldiers and women civilians, Jieitai Premium Club; a popular manga series drawn by a woman married to a JSDF man, Totsugeki Jiekan Zuma; and the monthly JSDF publication, Mamorâ€“and suggest that despite the ostensible pursuit of gender equality within the JSDF as evidenced in the increased recruitment of women, and the promoting of women to higher ranks, women continue to be imagined as â€˜helpmatesâ€™, just as they were during Japanâ€™s modernization process. They are discursively constructed as helpmates to men as wives and other female companions, and in being so constructed, become (un/conscious) supporters of the JSDF and thus helpmates to the state."
"Chances and Challenges of Vietnam's Garment Industry in the new Trend of Sustainable Development Medium Enterprises; Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME); Access to Finance To remain internationally competitive, Vietnam's garment industry aims to build upon low production costs with the target of taking available advantages from reasonable pricing, the improvement of product quality, and an increase in labor productivity. However, despite export growth, the added value of the industry is still not as worthy as its potential. This leads to the significance of the study to explore underlying reasons for what hindered the development of Vietnam's garment industry. The study was done following a two-phase study. Phase I was a qualitative exploration through in-depth interviews with eight companies' executives, and Phase II was quantitative research through an online survey from selected leading professors and company executives representing different aspects of Vietnam's garment industry. Six main themes emerging from this study reveal two different viewpoints of Vietnam's garment industry, including both chances and challenges that Vietnam's garment industry will be facing in the current trend of deepening and widening international integration."

"Exploring indigenous employee voice practice: perspectives from Vietnamese public sector organisations Employee Voice; Employment Relations; Workplace This study explores how the implementation of government policy with respect to Indigenous voice practice impacts on the workplace participation of Indigenous employees in Vietnamese public sector organisations. A qualitative case study approach was adopted capturing the perspectives of managers and Indigenous employees in three public sector agencies. The findings showed that, while government policies have led to increased Indigenous workforce participation, there are a range of barriers at the organisational level that limit and undermine workplace participation. These include first, inconsistencies in the interpretation and implementation of these policies at the organisational level due to the reliance on the discretion of individual managers. Second, the lack of awareness and commitment or even underlying racism of non-Indigenous managers which was exacerbated by inconsistency in direct employee voice practices. Third, trade unions played a minor role in integrating Indigenous voice with collective voice. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

"Tropical forest canopies and their relationships with climate and disturbance: results from a global dataset of consistent field-based measurements Leaf Area Index; Canopies; Canopy Reflectance Background: Canopy structure, defined by leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FCover) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), regulates a wide range of forest functions and ecosystem services. Spatially consistent field-measurements of canopy structure are however lacking, particularly for the tropics. Methods: Here, we introduce the Global LAI database: a global dataset of field-based canopy structure measurements spanning tropical forests in four continents (Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas). We use these measurements to test for climate dependencies within and across continents, and to test for the potential of anthropogenic disturbance and forest protection to modulate those dependences. Results: Using data collected from 887 tropical forest plots, we show that maximum water deficit, defined across the most arid months of the year, is an important predictor of canopy structure, with all three canopy attributes declining significantly with increasing water deficit. Canopy attributes also increase with minimum temperature, and with the protection of forests according to both active (within protected areas) and passive measures (through topography). Once protection and continent effects are accounted for, other anthropogenic measures (e.g. human population) do not improve the model. Conclusions: We conclude that canopy structure in the tropics is primarily a consequence of forest adaptation to the maximum water deficits historically experienced within a given region. Climate change, and in particular changes in drought regimes may thus affect forest structure and function, but forest protection may offer some resilience against this effect."
"Self-regulated, glucose-responsive nanomaterials for smart insulin delivery (administered by Monash University) Type 1 diabetes affects over 120,000 Australians and is associated with an up to a 4-fold increase in mortality. It is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Insulin injections are required for survival in type 1 diabetes. The major hurdle to achieving good glycaemic control with insulin is hypoglycaemia. Glucose lowering without the risk of hypoglycaemia would revolutionise the management of type 1 and possibly type 2 diabetes. This goal can be achieved with glucose-responsive insulin which would function in a similar manner as a β-cell.

"Volatility impacts on the European banking sector: GFC and COVID-19 Implied Volatility; Stochastic Volatility Model; Option Pricing This paper analyses the volatility transmission between European Global Systematically Important Banks (GSIBs) and implied stock market volatility. A Dynamic Conditional Correlation Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model is applied to determine the dynamic correlation between returns of Europeâ€™s GSIBs and the worldâ€™s most prominent measure of market â€œfearâ€, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). The results identify a higher negative co-relationship between the VIX and GSIB returns during the COVID-19 period compared with the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), with one-day lagged changes in the VIX negatively Granger-causing bank returns. The asymmetric impact of changes in implied volatility is examined by quantile regressions, with the findings showing that in the lower quartileâ€“where extreme negative bank returns are presentâ€“jumps in the VIX are highly significant. This effect is more pronounced during COVID-19 than during the GFC. Additional robustness analysis shows that these findings are consistent during the periods of the Swine Flu and Zika virus epidemics."
"Study on the Carbon Footprint Reduction Through Recycling Activities in UTHM: Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic ARIMA; Mathematical Modeling; COVID-19 Recycling is an excellent method to manage institutional solid waste and reduce the environmental carbon footprint. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented chaos and affected recycling activities in UTHM. Therefore, the trend of carbon reduction through recycling activities in UTHM was determined to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the trend of carbon reduction. The data was collected from the recycling center in UTHM and the carbon reduction was further calculated to compare the difference before and after the pandemic outbreak. The weight of paper products collected was the highest, accounting for more than 75%, while the weight of aluminium collected was the lowest, accounting for less than 1%. Furthermore, it was found that the trend of carbon reduction increased steadily in 2019. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused the trend to plunge and approach zero in March 2020. Nevertheless, once the COVID-19 pandemic was under control, the carbon reduction trend improved and peaked again in 2021. In addition, paper products achieved the highest of the total carbon reduction at 5143.072 tCO2e while aluminium was the lowest at 0.357 tCO2e. The highest total carbon reduction was achieved in 2019 with 1980.168 tCO2e while the lowest was recorded in 2020 with 1220.932 tCO2e. As a result, the Covid-19 Pandemic had a significant impact on the recycling rate in UTHM, which resulted in a reduction in the total amount of carbon reduction."
"R2P and Counter-Terrorism: Where Sovereignties Collide Humanitarian Intervention; First International; Ethnic Cleansing States play the lead role in implementing the norms of the international system. They interpret norms through the lens of their sovereignty, refining and revising them until they are suitable to local interests and context. The complex nature of sovereignty and its diverse manifestations across states means that norms will be interpreted and implemented in different ways. This article argues that R2P and counter-Terrorism are complex norm regimes which are susceptible to modification as they are interpreted through diverse conceptions of state sovereignty. Using the cases of China's response to the Uyghurs and Sri Lanka's response to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, this article shows that the malleable prescriptive norms of R2P and counter-Terrorism can be reinterpreted by states in ways contingent on their sovereignty that deeply impact, and may even violate, the original intent of the norm.

"Regulated and emerging disinfection by-products in recycled waters Disinfection; Haloacetic Acids; Chlorodibromomethane Disinfection is an integral component of water treatment performed daily on large volumes of water worldwide. Chemical disinfection may result in the unintended production of disinfectant by-products (DBPs) due to reactions between disinfectants and natural organic matter present in the source water. Due to their potential toxicity, levels of DBPs have been strictly regulated in drinking waters for many years. With water reuse now becoming more common around the world DBPs are increasingly becoming a concern in recycled waters, where a much larger amount and variety of compounds may be formed due to a higher abundance and diversity of organic material in the source waters. Regulation of DBPs in recycled waters is limited; generally, drinking water regulations are applied in place of specific guidelines for recycled waters. Such regulations are set for only 11, commonly observed, compounds of the 600+ that may, potentially, be found. In this review an overview of current research in this area is provided, the types of compounds that have been observed, methods for their analysis and possible regulation are also discussed. Through this review it is evident that there is a knowledge gap for the occurrence of DBPs in recycled waters, especially when comparing this information to that available for drinking waters. The concentrations of DBPs observed in recycled waters are seen to be higher than those in drinking water, though still within potable threshold limits. It is clear that there is a need for the analysis and understanding of a larger suite of compounds in recycled waters, as these will most likely be the source of future, global renewable water."
"The politics of urban greening: an introduction Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Global enthusiasm for nature in cities is at high point. Australia is no exception, where there is a great deal of policy momentum and research interest in urban greening. The challenges presented by increasing urban heat associated with climate change, greater awareness of the potential social, physical and psychological benefits of exposure to ecologies for people, and recognition of cities as vital habitats for more-than-humans are central tenants of urban greening enthusiasm. Yet, there is a need for a more critical lens on urban greening in Australia. One that interrogates the purported normative, apolitical and instrumental benefits of greening, to position greening within a trajectory of the power relations, settler-colonialism, socio-ecological processes and capital flows that constitute the urban. This editorial introducing the special issue on urban greening politics explores how different conceptions of urban naturesâ€“green space, urban forestry and green infrastructureâ€“have been put to work, before outlining the potential of â€˜urban greeningâ€™ as the terminology for a more politically sensitive and process-orientated framing. The editorial concludes with a summary of the contributions to the special issue."

"Microplastics in an anadromous national fish, Hilsa shad Tenualosa ilisha from the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Hilsa shad is one of the most important fisheries, contributing about 12.9% of the country's (Bangladesh) total fish production. There was no previous study on microplastic contamination of this important commercial fish. This study aims to identify, classify, and quantify microplastics (MPs) ingested by the national fish of Bangladesh, Hilsa shad, Tenualosa ilisha. A total of 287 MPs were recovered from the gastrointestinal tracts. All the fishes analyzed were contaminated with MPs. The mean (Â±SD) of the number of MPs was 19.13 Â± 10.77 particles/fish, ranging from 7 to 51 particles/fish. Significant correlation was not found between the fish body length and MP abundance (rs = 0.287, p = 0.299), and between the fish body weight and MPs abundance (rs = 0.261, p = 0.347). The most dominant color was transparent (30%), followed by gray and black, contributing to 26% and 23%, respectively. The maximum number of MPs accounted for in the 300â€“1500 Î¼m size class where fiber was the most dominant (50%) shape of observed MPs. These results provide a baseline of MP contamination in seafood from Bangladesh that should be useful for future monitoring efforts. The present study is the first research on MP contamination of Hilsa shad."
"The Contested Politics of Drought, Water Security and Climate Adaptation in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Droughts are intensifying in many mid-latitude river basins due to climate change; therefore understanding the influence of droughts on water policy is crucial. This study of the politics of water reforms in Australiaâ€™s Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) analyses contrasting discourses of water security during the Millennium Drought (1996-2010). The paper traces the historical evolution, mobilisation and effects of three discourses defined as 'drought-proofing', 'higher value use' and 'river restoration'. These are broadly aligned with engineering, economics and ecological perspectives, and while all discourses were integrated into government responses to the drought, the resurgence of drought-proofing significantly altered policy settings intended to shift MDB water management onto a more sustainable path. The paper illustrates the political and physical conditioning of water policy, placing drought responses in their historical context. The analysis demonstrates how policy actors used discourses of water security to define normative goals and legitimise policies, particularly when climatic extremes provide opportunities to influence policy outcomes. The paper provides three key insights for water governance and climate adaptation: first, drought responses can have far-reaching effects for water governance and policy trajectories; second, droughts pose challenges to positive climate adaptation when they revitalise heroic drought-proofing initiatives; and third, understanding the historical roots of contemporary drought responses is vital for effective climate adaptation"

"Ecotoxicology Goes on a Chip: Embracing Miniaturized Bioanalysis in Aquatic Risk Assessment Cancer; Lab-On-A-Chip Technology; Xenotransplantation Biological and environmental sciences are, more than ever, becoming highly dependent on technological and multidisciplinary approaches that warrant advanced analytical capabilities. Microfluidic lab-on-a-chip technologies are perhaps one the most groundbreaking offshoots of bioengineering, enabling design of an entirely new generation of bioanalytical instrumentation. They represent a unique approach to combine microscale engineering and physics with specific biological questions, providing technological advances that allow for fundamentally new capabilities in the spatiotemporal analysis of molecules, cells, tissues, and even small metazoan organisms. While these miniaturized analytical technologies experience an explosive growth worldwide, with a substantial promise of a direct impact on biosciences, it seems that lab-on-a-chip systems have so far escaped the attention of aquatic ecotoxicologists. In this Critical Review, potential applications of the currently existing and emerging chip-based technologies for aquatic ecotoxicology and water quality monitoring are highlighted. We also offer suggestions on how aquatic ecotoxicology can benefit from adoption of microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices for accelerated bioanalysis."

"Selection and survival in the field of cultural production: a longitudinal study of the Australian census Cultural Economy; Freelancer; Art Research on work in the Creative and Cultural Industries (CCI) often combines macro-level accounts of political economy with small-scale studies, often qualitative, of work in specific organisations and/or sectors. While rich in both the theory and qualitative detail of creative labour, and especially useful for the study of precarious and informal work, such studies cannot capture population movements within cultural employment over time, nor the factors associated with continuing employment. The Australian Census Longitudinal Dataset (ACLD) provides a unique opportunity to track a national sample of workers in a broad range of cultural occupations across two waves of the Australian census, 2006 and 2016. This provides an opportunity to consider the factors associated with both selection into, and continuity within, cultural production employment. The study of factors associated with primary employment in cultural occupations is significant, as such positions are a relatively privileged resource within a broader field characterised by temporary and informal work arrangements, including casual, contract and unpaid work, that are not captured in the Census. The question of who holds these positions is a question of social distribution. We examine the key factors such as gender, age, qualifications, geography and household dynamics, to compare their relative importance in determining the employment and continuity of work in the field of cultural production."

"Does the Reserve Bank of Australia follow a forward-looking nonlinear monetary policy rule? DSGE Model; Interest Rates; Monetary Policy The conventional monetary policy rule describes a simple linear relationship between the domestic interest rate, inflation rate and output gap. An important extension to this rule is to incorporate the forward-looking behaviour of central banks, where it is assumed that they target an expected level of inflation instead of its current realised value. Using quarterly observations for the period 1993:1-2018:2, this paper investigates whether the conduct of monetary policy in Australia can be described by a forward-looking linear monetary policy rule, or by a nonlinear forward-looking monetary policy rule. In particular, the nonlinear forward-looking monetary policy rule is analysed in a regime-switching framework using a smooth logistic transition regression model. While the results show that the conventional forward-looking linear monetary policy rule describes the application of monetary policy in Australia reasonably well, the interest rate setting behaviour of the RBA is best described by a nonlinear forward-looking monetary policy rule."
"Vernacular human security and moris diak in timor-leste: A social contract between the living and spirit actants Timor-Leste; Post-Independence; Peacebuilding The concept of human security argues that the improvement of peopleâ€™s wellbeing and livelihoods is a vital component in the stability of the state. What happens, however, when the state is not viewed as the only (if at all) source of influence on peopleâ€™s everyday security? This article argues for a particular vernacular of human security that recognizes a social contract between the living with spirit actants, in ways that can often compete with or challenge state-building efforts. In Timor-Leste, ancestral spirits (matebian sira) can directly intervene in the physical safety of their living descendants, and livelihoods (in terms of food security) often depends on engagement between the living and their ancestors as well as nature spirits (rai-nain-sira)."

"Influence of direct deposition of dielectric materials on the optical response of monolayer WS2 Molybdenum Disulfide; Monolayer; Van Der Waals We investigate the effects of direct deposition of different dielectric materials (AlOx, SiOx, SiNx) onto atomically thin TMDC WS2 on its optical response using atomic layer deposition (ALD), electron beam evaporation (EBE), plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and magnetron sputtering. The photoluminescence measurements reveal quenching of the excitonic emission after all deposition processes, which is linked to the increased level of charge doping and associated rise of the trion emission and/or the localized (bound) exciton emission. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy allows us to clearly correlate the observed changes in excitonic emission with the increased levels of lattice disorder and defects. In particular, we show that the different doping levels in a monolayer WS2 capped by a dielectric material are strongly related to the defects in the WS2 crystal introduced by all capping methods, except for ALD. The strong charge doping in the ALD-capped sample seems to be caused by other factors, such as deviations in the dielectric layer stoichiometry or chemical reactions on the monolayer surface, which makes ALD distinct from all other techniques. Overall, the EBE process results in the lowest level of doping and defect densities and in the largest spectral weight of the exciton emission in the PL. Sputtering is revealed as the most aggressive dielectric capping method for WS2, fully quenching its optical response. Our results demonstrate and quantify the effects of direct deposition of dielectric materials onto monolayer WS2, which can provide valuable guidance for the efforts to integrate monolayer TMDCs into functional optoelectronic devices."
"Outrage in Malaysia: The Politics of Taking Offence Malaysia; British Malaya; Islam This article develops a general articulation of the politics of offence and outrage by drawing on examples of high profile political furores in Malaysia. In these furores, minority ethno-religious groups and individuals ostensibly caused offence to the majority Muslim Malay population. Although these offences were framed as transgressions of genuine sensitivities, I argue that politics of offence must be seen for the political utility it holds for those who claim to represent the majority group that has been putatively offended. In Malaysia, a key component of this political strategy is the positioning by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) of its constituencyâ€”the Malaysâ€”as being comparatively economically weaker than non-Malay groups. This positioning in turn warrants the continuation of the positive discrimination policies of the New Economic Policy of the 1970s, which was implemented to achieve parity between the major ethnic groups in Malaysia. An example of this was when UMNO vehemently rejected the findings of a think tank that argued that the New Economic Policyâ€™s target of having 30% Malay ownership of equity had been achieved. This positioning of an in-group as weak, and the normalisation of privilege in the Malaysian context, is analysed in view of two other cases studies, Erving Goffmanâ€™s concept of â€˜the turnâ€™, and Ward Goodenoughâ€™s description of the human experience of outrage. I also show that â€˜outrageâ€™ as a politico-emotional strategy remains effective despite the momentous results of Malaysiaâ€™s general elections in 2018, which might otherwise herald a new era of inter-ethnic co-operation."
"Scaled-up ‘safety-net’ schooling and the ‘wicked problem’ of educational exclusion in South Australia: problem or solution? Alternative Education; Young; Disengagement In this article, we investigate a major, long-running policy intervention to combat educational exclusion in South Australia (SA): the Interagency Community Action Networks (ICAN)-Flexible Learning Options (FLO) policy and program agenda (ICAN-FLO). SA is unique for having the only bureaucratically systematised â€˜social inclusionâ€™ schooling approach to the problem of early school leaving in Australia. We frame ICAN-FLO using the concept of wicked problems in policy and specify how some problematic features of ICAN-FLO since its inception in 2007 are predicted by this concept. Problems with ICAN-FLO include a lack of public accountability; shortcomings in transparency about attainment of students enrolled in ICAN-FLO; and the consequent danger that public confidence in ICAN-FLO will be undermined. Constructive suggestions to address these weaknesses are offered, including, more conceptual policy work in partnership with collective and independent stakeholder inquiry and research. We conclude that one ever-present danger with bureaucratically scaled-up social inclusion initiatives like ICAN-FLO is that such initiatives become a parallel â€˜safety-netâ€™ education system for the disadvantaged and thereby corrode the principle of an inclusive mainstream education system meeting the needs of all children and young people in SA or elsewhere."

"Examining the commercially available hydrophobic membranes in combined desalination and power generation through permeate gap membrane distillation Distillation; Direct Contact; Membrane Developing robust and sustainable desalination processes with minimum energy consumption in integration with renewable energy sources is on high demand in the current climate. Utilizing membrane-based processes for either freshwater production or power generation has appeared as a promising approach in recent years. This research further examines the potential of utilizing a permeate gap membrane distillation (PGMD) system integrated with a sealed air tank to produce combined freshwater and power (CWP) on the laboratory scale. In this study, different commercial hydrophobic membranes with 0.2 to 0.02 Î¼m pore size ranges have been tested and the laminated membranes have been examined in two mounting orientations. The maximum harvested hydraulic pressure and power density by using a pristine 0.1 Î¼m nominal pore size laminated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane facing the active layer to the feed channel (ALF orientation), were measured at approximately 1.8 bar and 0.47 W/m2, respectively under the defined test condition. Mounting the active layer to the permeate side (ALP orientation), the maximum hydraulic pressure and power density recorded at approximately 3.6 bar and 0.42 W/m2, respectively. The experimental data using the 0.02 Î¼m pore size laminated hydrophobic PTFE membrane showed the same pattern. That is, despite producing higher hydraulic pressure with currently available commercial smaller pore size membrane in the ALP orientation, the generated power density has not increased significantly or may have even reduced. Hence, the development of high compressive resistance membranes with high permeability, low surface energy and narrow pore size distribution characteristics, is vital to be able to propose the CWP process using membrane distillation (MD) systems as a competitive and sustainable desalination technology."
"Mathematical Modelling Comparison of a Reciprocating, a Szorenyi Rotary, and a Wankel Rotary Engine Rotary Engines; Combustion Chambers; Pump This paper provides an explanation of the geometry, design, and operational principles for the three engines; having special emphasis in the Szorenyi rotary engine which has a deforming rhombus revolving inside a mathematically defined stator. A basic ideal mathematical simulation of those engines were performed, assuming the Otto cycle for the three engines. Also, it assumes the volumetric efficiency of 100%, a wide-open throttle (WOT), no knock nor any mechanical or thermal losses. This simulation focuses on how the fuel burns during combustion, creating pressure and thus, net work. A comparison in pressure traces and cycle performance is made. The study concludes analysing and comparing the ignition advance; finding the best advance for each engine thus the net work between the three engines during one working cycle. Finally, this paper analyses how the different volume change ratio for the combustion chamber of the Szorenyi, Wankel and the reciprocating engine have an effect in the pressure, net work and thermal efficiency generated inside the chamber during combustion for every working cycle."
"Prediction of thermo-physical properties of 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate for CO2 capture using machine learning models Ionic Liquids; Thermodynamic Properties; Densimeters Physical and thermodynamic properties of physical or chemical solvents are of utmost importance for mass and heat transfer calculations, process design and solvent regeneration. In recent times, machine learning has attracted interest for applications in several fields of engineering sciences.

"Government reform, regulatory change and carbon disclosure: Evidence from Australia Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative This paper examines the effect of two Australian environmental regulatory changes, specifically the Clean Energy Act (CEA) 2011 and the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) Act 2007 with reference to voluntary corporate carbon disclosure practices. In doing so, it describes the brief history of this carbon-related regulatory change, its scope, enforcement criteria and corporationsâ€™ disclosures. This is a longitudinal analysis of 219 annual reports of 73 listed corporations in Australia which were subjected to carbon tax and report carbon emissions as per the CEA 2011 and NGER Act 2007 accordingly. Any corporation or facility that emitted scope 1 emissions of 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) or more were liable for a carbon tax in accordance with CEA 2011. Drawing on stakeholder theory and legitimacy theory, this study uses content analysis to examine corporate carbon disclosure. The findings suggest there is a considerable increase in the number of carbon-related disclosures following these regulations being enacted as law. In addition, carbon-specific communication has become much more prevalent and accounts for a larger proportion of the sampled organisationsâ€™ reported environmental information. The results of this study enrich the validity of the hypothesis that organisations would seek to legitimise their operations to stakeholders by increasing their environment-related declarations. The evidence presented in the analysis confirms the assertion that government environmental legislation/regulation has a positive impact on corporate behaviour and accountability. These findings have significant consequences for the government, decision-makers and the accounting profession, indicating that regulatory guidance enhances both mandatory and voluntary disclosure. It also offers key insights into the possible impacts of the carbon regulatory change for future research to consider."
"The Distribution of Artistic Human Capital – A Typology Building Approach Agglomeration Economies; Creative Class; China Artists have long been understood to play a vital role in local communities. Our intent is to develop a deeper understanding of the distribution of artistic human capital; specifically, the extent to which particular patterns of co-location exist across Australia. We find little evidence of patterns by type of artistic human capital. Interestingly, however, our analysis does reveal a form of grouping that enables us to prescribe a typology based on the degree to which the number of types of artistic human capital resides. Using this typology we explore differences among states and regions across Australia."
"Effects of Working from Home on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Associated Energy Costs in Six Australian Cities Personnel; Teleworker; Flexible Working Working from home (WFH) has been imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The adoption of WFH impacts energy use in the residential, commercial, and transportation sectors. Consequently, this affects the greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) and the associated energy costs to workers and employers. This study estimates the effects of WFH on the GHGE and energy-related costs in the residential, commercial, and transportation sectors. A simple linear model was used to estimate the changes in the GHGEs and cost by a typical employee when WFH practice is adopted for 1.5 and 4 days per week. The adoption of WFH reduces the operational GHGE accounted for commercial buildings and transport. However, it increases the operational GHGE accounted for residential buildings, which is a maximum of about 6% and 12%, respectively, for WFH 1.5 and 4 days. The reduction of GHGE from transport is significantly higher than that of residential buildings. The GHGE reductions from the transport sector are about 30% and 80%, respectively, for WFH 1.5 days and 4 days per week. WFH for 1.5 and 4 days per week reduces the national annual GHGE by about 1.21 Mt CO2-e and 5.76 Mt CO2-e, respectively. Further, the annual transportation cost of an employee is reduced by 30% and 80% in each city when the employee WFH for 1.5 and 4 days per week. The outcomes of this study offer a direction to reduce energy consumption and related costs and potential future research avenues on this topic. Further, the findings also help policymakers develop a hybrid work model for the post-COVID-19 pandemic."
"Fast and Highly Sensitive Detection of Pathogens Wreathed with Magnetic Nanoparticles Using Dark-Field Microscopy Cryptosporidium; Animals; Oocysts Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) is a highly potent zoonotic pathogen, which can do significant harm to both human beings and livestock. However, existing technologies or methods are deficient for rapid on-site detection of water contaminated with C. parvum. Better detection approaches are needed to allow water management agencies to stop major breakouts of the pathogen. Herein, we present a novel detection method for cryptosporidium in a tiny drop of sample using a magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) probe combined with dark-field microscopy in 30 min. The designed MNP probes bind with high affinity to C. parvum, resulting in the formation of a golden garland-like structure under dark-field microscopy. This MNP-based dark-field counting strategy yields an amazing PCR-like sensitivity of 8 attomolar (aM) (5 pathogens in 1 Î¼L). Importantly, the assay is very rapid (-30 min) and is very simple to perform as it involves only one step of mixing and magnetic separation, followed by dropping on a slide for counting under dark-field microscope. By combining the advantages of the specific light-scattering characteristic of MNP probe under dark field and the selective magnetic separation ability of functionalized MNP, the proposed MNP-based dark-field enumeration method offers low cost and significant translational potential."
"Opportunities for Growth: Australia and Viet Nam Australia's economicengagement with Viet Nam lags that of its Asian neighbours. in 2018, Viet Nam was  Australia's 15th largesttrading partner, ranking behind Hong Kong, Taiwan and Indonesia. Viet Nam's rapid  growth over the last few decades offers tremendous opportunities. in the third quarter of 2019, Viet Nam recorded 7 per cent growth. Australia's two-way trade with Viet Nam is forecast to grow at almost 11% over the next 5 years, second only to India.
The governments of both countries have recognised this potential and established a strategic partnership to deepen the relationship.Akey priority is developing an Enhanced Economic Engagement Strategy with the goal of becoming top ten trade partners and doubling investment. The Prime Ministers of both countries expressed support forfacilrtating agricultural market access and collaboration on energy security and digital opportunities.
To achieve these overarching goals, businesses on the ground need access to timely information on the products, services and sectors that offer the most viable opportunities. Interested entrants need market intelligence to allow them to make an informed judgement on how best to enter the market. Operating in a foreign market also requires an understanding of local challenges, non-tariff barriers and ways to address them. There is a need for research to identify the specific barriers that Australian businesses face in Viet Nam, provide case studies of successful ventures, share best practice and recommend policy reforms.
The Asia Society and Australian APEC Study Centre at RMIT University are jointly developing a business-friendly research report to further enhance engagement with Viet Nam."

"Rare earth elements (REE) for the removal and recovery of phosphorus: A review Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption There is little doubt that â€˜rock phosphateâ€™ reserves are decreasing, with phosphorus (P) peak to be reached in the coming decades. Hence, removal and recovery of phosphorus (P) from alternative nutrient-rich waste streams is critical and of great importance owing to its essential role in agricultural productivity. Adsorption technique is efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable for P recovery from waste streams which otherwise can cause eutrophication in receiving waters. As selective P sorption using rare earth elements (REE) are gaining considerable attention, this review extensively focuses on P recovery by utilising a range of REE-incorporated adsorbents. The review briefly provides existing knowledge of P in various waste streams, and examines the chemistry and behaviour of REE in soil and water in detail. The impact of interfering ions on P removal using REE, adsorbent regeneration for reuse, and life cycle assessment of REE are further explored. While it is clear that REE-sorbents have excellent potential to recover P from wastewaters and to be used as fertilisers, there are gaps to be addressed. Future studies should target recovery and reuse of REE as P fertilisers using real wastewaters. More field trials of synthesized REE-sorbents are highly recommended before practical application."

"Development of novel design strength model for sustainable concrete columns: A new machine learning-based approach Concrete Aggregates; Construction and Demolition Waste; Mechanical Properties Billions of tons of construction and demolition (C&D) waste generation is causing global environmental crises. The application of C&D waste in concrete columns is a sustainable avenue but hindered due to a lack of comprehensive design guidelines. Currently, no work is available in the open literature regarding the machine-learning-based comprehensive design strength models of spiral steel confined natural aggregate concrete (SSCNAC) and recycled aggregate concrete (SSCRAC) columns. This study comprehensively evaluates ten machine-learning techniques, including random forest, gradient boost, Ada boost, k-nearest neighbor, bagging regressor, support vector, XG boost, decision tree, artificial neural network, and gene expression programming for design strength modeling of SSCNAC and SSCRAC columns. A test database comprising 290 experiment results is developed and used for modeling. The accuracy of models is improved using hyper-parameter tuning and cross-validation functions. The performance of machine-learning techniques is evaluated through various statistical parameters. Results indicate that the spiral steel strength and the unconfined concrete compressive strength are the most critical inputs to predict the design strength of SSCNAC and SSCRAC columns. All the machine-learning models can accurately predict the design strength of SSCNAC and SSCRAC better than the existing models and can be practical tools for the accurate design strength modeling of the SSCNAC and SSCRAC. A one of its kind of a comprehensive machine learning-based design equation is proposed in this study, which can be used to predict the design strength of SSCNAC and SSCRAC accurately, leading towards the sustainable design of eco-friendly concrete columns."
"Achieving arithmetic learning in honeybees and examining how individuals learn Numerosity; Number Line; Approximate In recent years honeybees have demonstrated intriguing numerical capacities, leading to the recent discovery of their ability to perform simple arithmetic by learning to add or subtract â€˜oneâ€™ using symbolic representations of operators. When training an insect with a miniature brain containing less than one million neurons to understand a conceptual rule, the procedure is of vital importance. We explain in detail the controls and process of designing an experiment to test for complex behaviors in a relatively simple brained animal. Furthermore, we will discuss the finding that individual honeybees do not demonstrate a consistent learning scenario when trained to perform the same tasks, rather they appear to acquire arithmetic rules through individual processes."
"Soil Security for Australia Spatial Autocorrelation; Soil Organic Carbon; Carbon Sinks Soil Security is an emerging sustainability science concept with global application for guiding integrated approaches to land management, while balancing ecosystem services, environmental, social, cultural, and economic imperatives. This discussion paper sets the scene for an Australian Soil Security framework as an example of how it might be developed for any country, defining the key issues and justification for Soil Security, as well as detailing implementation requirements and benefits; two examples of beneficial outcomes are provided in terms of facilitating decommoditization of agricultural products and the impact of urban encroachment on productive land. We highlight research gaps, where new knowledge will contribute to well-rounded approaches that reflect differing stakeholder perspectives. We also provide key nomenclature associated with a potential Soil Security framework so that future discussions may use a common language. Through this work we invite scientific and policy discourse with the aim of developing more informed responses to the myriad of competing demands placed on our soil systems."
"Adaptive management in groundwater planning and development: A review of theory and applications Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework Adaptive management (AM) is an approach that uses targeted monitoring and investigation to improve future management practices in a structured and iterative way through reassessment of the efficacy of management policies and system understanding. AM has received significant attention in groundwater management for its purported capability to counteract key uncertainties inherent in estimating future environmental responses to human activities. While the theoretical strengths of AM have long been recognized, practical applications have produced mixed results across the many facets of environmental management. In this study, we review AM principles and groundwater management case studies, including urban water supply, agriculture and mining applications, to critically evaluate AM strategies applied to groundwater contexts. We identified substantial variability in the interpretation of AM principles across eleven groundwater case studies. Comparison of published AM guidelines and groundwater examples of AM plans revealed significant shortcomings in many AM applications, while a small number of AM plans largely adhere to the key components of AM identified in the guidelines. The most notable issues in the application of AM to groundwater activities include a lack of substantive mitigation measures and/or assessment of the potential for remediation. Construction of clear definitions and guidelines for AM applied to groundwater management is required to set the expectations of regulatory bodies and government departments responsible for assessing groundwater-affecting projects, and to ensure that the protective attributes of AM are properly incorporated into project plans. This will lead to greater transparency in groundwater related planning and expected outcomes for stakeholders."
"Mapping informal settlement indicators using object-oriented analysis in the Middle East Remote Sensing; Informal Settlements; Building Density Mapping informal settlements is crucial for resource and utility management and planning. In 2003, the UN-Habitat developed a process for mapping and monitoring urban inequality to support reporting against the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Informal settlement indicators are used as a framework to carry out image analysis, and include vegetation extent, lacunarity of housing structures / vacant land, road segment type and materials, texture measures of built-up areas, roofing extent of built-up areas and dwelling size. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods are recommended to identify informal settlements. This paper documents the application of OBIA to map informal settlements, drawing on the ontology of Kohli et al. (2012) and the indicators of Owen and Wong (2013) for a Middle Eastern city. Three informal settlements with different land use histories were selected to represent old and new informal settlements in the city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Vegetation extent was the most successful indicator detected, with 100% producer accuracy and over 84% user accuracy, followed by the road network, with 84% producer and user accuracies in older informal settlements and 73% producer accuracy and 96% user accuracy across all case studies. Lacunarity of housing structures / vacant land was detected well in informal settlements. The texture measure indicator was detected using GLCMEnt(R) with low producer accuracy across all case studies. The roofing extent of the built-up area is detected with better producer and user accuracies than texture measures. The dwellings size indicator generally failed to distinguish formal from informal settlements. Informal and formal were distinguished with an overall accuracy of 83%. This research concludes that OBIA is a useful method to map informal settlement indicators in Middle Eastern cities. However, a generic ruleset for mapping informal settlements remains elusive, and each indicator requires significant localised â€˜tuningâ€™."
"Assessing the Utilisation of TELedentistry from Perspectives of Early Career Dental Practitioners - Development of the UTEL Questionnaire Oral Health; Dental Care; Teeth Introduction: Teledentistry has allowed for the provision of dental care remotely. It has benefitted people living in regional, rural and remote communities. The use of teledentistry rapidly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic to minimise transmission risk while still allowing for the provision of care, especially during mandated lockdowns. Aim: This study aims to pilot and assess the validity of a questionnaire developed to understand early career dental practitionersâ€™ opinions regarding teledentistry in Australia. Method: Registered early career dental practitioners currently working in Australia were invited to participate. Participants were asked to respond to a series of questions regarding teledentistry on themes containing diagnosis, accessibility, patient care, technology and finances. In addition, participants were asked for feedback upon the conclusion of the questionnaire. Results: A total of 23 dental practitioners (60% female, age range 20â€“34) participated in this study. Work experiences ranged from 0â€“10 years. A total of 18 participants worked in metropolitan areas, while five worked in regional areas. All participants used teledentistry for approximately 1â€“9 hours per week. Over 82% of participants believed that telehealth was effective for consultations, and over 90% believed it was more convenient than face-to-face consultations. However, over 78% believed teledentistry was ineffective for diagnosing complex dental cases. Over 95% of participants believed that teledentistry improved patient healthcare access and was beneficial during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. All participants believed that teledentistry was a useful tool for post-operative care, and over 86% of participants felt that patients accepted teledentistry. Conclusion: This questionnaire effectively determines the utilisation of teledentistry during a global pandemic from the perspective of early career dental practitioners."
"Assessment of the Actual and Potential Contributions of Smart City Projects to Climate Resilience in Selected Asia-Pacific Cities Smart city initiatives enabled by Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are deemed essential for helping cities to develop transformative solutions to address the challenges of global change and to create just, sustainable, and resilient communities. Several countries in the AsiaPacific region (e.g., Japan, Taiwan, China, Australia, and India) are at the forefront of designing/implementing smart city projects. While a vast body of knowledge exists on the contributions of such projects to sustainability and quality of life, little is known about their contributions to climate resilience and climate action planning. As many cities in the region are exposed to a broad array of climate-related disasters, enhancing resilience is expected to be at the center of smart city development efforts. Accordingly, the main aim of the proposed project is to investigate the contributions of selected smart city projects to climate resilience. Through inter- and
trans- disciplinary methods and workshops that involve a wide range of stakeholders, we will develop a smart city resilience assessment toolkit and use it to examine actual and/or potential performance of selected cases in Australia, China, Taiwan, India, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, and the United States. Results will provide useful scientific and policy knowledge on how to integrate resilience thinking into smart city developments and will also highlight lessons that can be transferred to less developed countries.

"Bubble rise velocity and bubble size in thickened waste activated sludge: Utilising electrical resistance tomography (ERT) Sewage; Total Solids; Activated Sludge Bubble columns are intensively used in many different industries as multiphase contactors. The gas phase properties in the bubble column significantly impact on the hydrodynamics of the column which effects on heat and mass transfer rates within the column. In this paper, electrical resistance tomography together with dynamic gas disengagement technique is used to determine the gas holdup and bubble rise velocity within the column at four different gas flow rates (1â€“7 L/min) and two different total solids concentrations of waste activated sludge (3% & 5.5%). For the first time, effective shear rate and bubble size are calculated based on the Herschelâ€“Bulkley model. A linear relation was observed for the bubble rise velocity with stress imposed and between gas holdup and natural logarithm of stress imposed by gas injection."
"A Novel Acoustomicrofluidic Nebulization Technique Yielding New Crystallization Morphologies Supercritical Fluids; Nanocrystal; Povidone A novel acoustic microfluidic nebulization platform is demonstrated, which, due to its unique ability to access intermediate evaporation rate regimesâ€”significantly faster than that in slow solvent evaporation but considerably below that achieved in spray drying, is capable of producing novel crystal morphologies that have yet to be reported in both model inorganic and organic systems. In addition, the potential for simultaneously encapsulating single crystals within a biodegradable polymeric coating in a single simultaneous step together with the crystallization process as the solvent evaporates during nebulization is briefly shown. The platform not only has the potential to be highly scalable by employing a large number of these low-cost miniature devices in parallel to achieve industrially relevant particle production rates, but could also be advantageous over conventional spray drying in terms of energy utilization, given the tremendous efficiency associated with the high-frequency ultrasonic microdevice as well as its ambient temperature operation."

"A reference data framework for the application of satellite time series to monitor forest disturbance Landsat; Land Cover; Remote Sensing Comprehensive and robust estimations of forest disturbance over time are lacking in many parts of the world. In recent years, Landsat satellite data has been used extensively to retrospectively map forest disturbance across several decades. Human interpretation of Landsat time series, in association with ancillary data, has emerged as an effective and affordable way to collect reference data, which is often used to calibrate and validate disturbance models. If the reference data is collected using a robust probability sampling protocol, estimates of disturbance can be derived directly from the reference dataset using simple calculations. In this paper, we present the results of a reference data project in New South Wales, Australia, undertaken to characterise three decades of canopy disturbance across 13 Mha of predominantly native eucalypt forests. Our results indicate that disturbance is a frequent occurrence, with 70% of the forest disturbed during the last 33 years and around 35% experiencing two or more disturbances. The most common disturbance agent was wildfire, however, most wildfire disturbance occurred in few years, with over 4 Mha burnt in 2019â€“20 alone. The second most common disturbance agent was drought, which together with fire, was strongly influenced by low rainfall in the preceding years. Forest recovery was often quite rapid following disturbance, particularly in the event of increased rainfall. In this study, we demonstrate the value of collecting information in a systematic and comprehensive framework, which can be used to address numerous monitoring questions regarding forest canopy disturbance."
"Assessing of water quality and sedimentation problems in lata sungai limau, Malaysia Water Quality; Multivariate Analysis; Nonpoint Source Pollution Sedimentation problem and water quality deterioration are the occurrences happened along the river basin especially at main river basin in Malaysia. The main objective of this study to review the sedimentation problems and water quality deterioration level in the Lata Sungai Limau, Terengganu, Malaysia. 11 sampling stations were chosen from upstream until downstream. There are four mains contributed in this study such as water quality parameters, distribution of sediment grain size, concentration of total suspended solids (TSS) and river discharge (Q) respectively. From leave-one-out method showed chemical oxygen demand and TSS are the most importance water quality variables with river discharge (Q). The formation of sediment load per day falls between 53.540 kg/d (Station 2) and 1,164.394 kg/d (Station 5) for all sampling stations contributed. The result showed the sizes of sediment recorded phi â€“0.011 and phi 0.768 with very rough particle sizes which are between phi 1.00 and phi 0.00. All parties involved need to take responsibility and be more aware to environmental deterioration and awareness. This research conducted to enlighten the public about the importance of the environment, especially river basins."
"How urban forest managers evaluate management and governance challenges in their decision-making Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Decisions about urban forests are critical to urban liveability and resilience. This study aimed to evaluate the range of positions held by urban forest managers from local governments in the state of Victoria, Australia, regarding the management and governance challenges that affect their decision-making. This study was based on a Q-method approach, a procedure that allows researchers to evaluate the range of positions that exist about a topic in a structured manner based on the experiences of a wide group of people. We created statements on a wide range of urban forest management and governance challenges and asked urban forest managers to rate their level of agreement with these statements via an online survey. Managers generally agreed about the challenges posed by urban development and climate change for implementing local government policies on urban forest protection and expansion. However, there were divergent views about how effective solutions based on increasing operational capacities, such as increasing budgets and personnel, could address these challenges. For some managers, it was more effective to improve critical governance challenges, such as inter-departmental and inter-municipal coordination, community engagement, and addressing the culture of risk aversion in local governments. Urban forest regional strategies aimed at coordinating management and governance issues across cities should build on existing consensus on development and environmental threats and address critical management and governance issues not solely related to local government operational capacity."
"Co-pelletization of Microalgae-Sewage Sludge Blend with Sub-bituminous Coal as Solid Fuel Feedstock Sewage; Pyrolysis; Pulp and Paper Sludge Microalgae have been appeared as excellent source of bioenergy recently in Brunei Darussalam due to the favorable growth conditions, while sewage sludge emerged as major threat to the environment. Therefore, the challenge of sewage sludge management and microalgae utilization has spurred the demand of developing an innovative approach to utilize these sources for commercial applications. Hence, the main objective of this study was to characterize the bioenergy properties of microalgae, sewage sludge, and different blending ratios of microalgae-sewage sludge incorporated with sub-bituminous coal. Among three different blended samples, sample mixture 1 (SM-1) combined with 25% microalgae, 25% sewage sludge, and 50% coal presented the highest calorific value of 16.57 MJ/kg and lowest ash content of 45.61%. Along with this, SM-1 also manifested the highest values for pellet density (1.23 g/cm3) and energy density (20.41 GJ/m3) that can be referred as the most favorable values among all co-pelletized samples for transportation and logistics. Besides the characterization of raw samples, this study also emphasized on elemental analysis of ash content to determine the possibility of fouling and slugging. Ash analysis of all blends represented the major inorganic components aluminum (Al) and silicon (Si). Thermogravimetric analysis of all samples demonstrated the different phases of pyrolysis and combustion within 50 to 900 Â°C at heating rate of 10 Â°C/min. It can be concluded that this study recommended SM-1 as a potential feedstock for solid fuel purpose."
"Remediation of mining soils by combining Brassica napus growth and amendment with chars from manure waste Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Mining activities lead to important physical, chemical and biological effects on soil properties, generating severe impacts in the establishment and maintenance of vegetation. Assisted phytoremediation can be considered an environmentally friendly approach for soil remediation. In this study, two mining soils (PORT and GAM) were treated with 10%, by mass, of the following amendments: manure biochars prepared at 450 Â°C (BMW450) and 600 Â°C (BMW600), hydrochars prepared by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of manure at 190 Â°C (HWM190) and 240 Â°C (HMW240) and manure waste (MW). Brassica napus was used as a phytoextraction species. After 45 days of plant growth, soil samples were widely characterized, including microbial biomass carbon, enzymatic activity and metal content. In addition, plant biomass production, bioconcentration factor, translocation factor and metal uptake were determined. Experimental results showed that addition of biochars improved the As uptake by Brassica napus in both soils but just in the roots increasing bioconcentration factor between 22.1 and 39.5% for GAM soil and between 28.6 and 53.4% for PORT soil. Brassica napus cannot be considered as Zn accumulator in GAM soil samples and in the case of PORT samples, only the addition of BMW600 and HMW240 enhanced the phytoextraction process of Zn on the roots. Soil enzyme activity improved in hydrochar amended soils."

"Current status of and future opportunities for digital agriculture in Australia Energy Transition; Innovation System; Sustainability In Australia, digital agriculture is considered immature and its adoption ad hoc, despite a relatively advanced technology innovation sector. In this review, we focus on the technical, governance and social factors of digital adoption that have created a disconnect between technology development and the end user community (farmers and their advisors). Using examples that reflect both successes and barriers in Australian agriculture, we first explore the current enabling technologies and processes, and then we highlight some of the key socio-technical factors that explain why digital agriculture is immature and ad hoc. Pronounced issues include fragmentation of the innovation system (and digital tools), and a lack of enabling legislation and policy to support technology deployment. To overcome such issues and increase adoption, clear value propositions for change are necessary. These value propositions are influenced by the perceptions and aspirations of individuals, the delivery of digitally-enabled processes and the supporting legislative, policy and educational structures, better use/conversion of data generated through technology applications to knowledge for supporting decision making, and the suitability of the technology. Agronomists and early adopter farmers will play a significant role in closing the technology-end user gap, and will need support and training from technology service providers, government bodies and peer-networks. Ultimately, practice change will only be achieved through mutual understanding, ownership and trust. This will occur when farmers and their advisors are an integral part of the entire digital innovation system."
"Uptake, depuration and sublethal effects of the neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, exposure in Sydney rock oysters Neonicotinoids; Imidacloprid; Nicotinic Receptors The broad utilisation of imidacloprid (IMI)in agriculture poses an increasing risk to aquatic organisms. However, the potential impacts on commercially important shellfish and chemical residues after exposure, are yet to be assessed. We investigated the levels of IMI in Sydney rock oyster (SRO)tissue during a three-day uptake and four-day depuration cycle using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. IMI was absorbed from the water, with significantly higher concentrations in the adductor muscles than the gills and digestive glands. Depuration was also fast with a significant drop in tissue concentrations after one day in clean water and complete elimination from all tissues except the digestive gland after four days. The distribution of IMI in SRO after direct exposure using mass spectrometry imaging demonstrated uptake and spatially resolved metabolism to hydroxyl-IMI in the digestive gland and IMI-olefin in the gills. We assessed the effects of IMI on filtration rate (FR), acetylcholinesterase (AChE)activity in the gills, and gene expression profiles in the digestive gland using transcriptomics. Exposure to 2 mg/L IMI reduced the FR of oysters on the first day, while exposure to 0.5 and 1 mg/L reduced FR on day four. IMI reduced the gill AChE activity and altered the digestive gland gene expression profile. This study indicates that commercially farmed SRO can uptake IMI from the water, but negative impacts were only detected at concentrations higher than currently detected in estuarine environments and the chemical residues can be effectively eliminated using simple depuration in clean water."
"Bridge to the future: Important lessons from 20 years of ecosystem observations made by the OzFlux network Eddy Covariance; Net Ecosystem Exchange; Ecosystem In 2020, the Australian and New Zealand flux research and monitoring network, OzFlux, celebrated its 20th anniversary by reflecting on the lessons learned through two decades of ecosystem studies on global change biology. OzFlux is a network not only for ecosystem researchers, but also for those â€˜next usersâ€™ of the knowledge, information and data that such networks provide. Here, we focus on eight lessons across topics of climate change and variability, disturbance and resilience, drought and heat stress and synergies with remote sensing and modelling. In distilling the key lessons learned, we also identify where further research is needed to fill knowledge gaps and improve the utility and relevance of the outputs from OzFlux. Extreme climate variability across Australia and New Zealand (droughts and flooding rains) provides a natural laboratory for a global understanding of ecosystems in this time of accelerating climate change. As evidence of worsening global fire risk emerges, the natural ability of these ecosystems to recover from disturbances, such as fire and cyclones, provides lessons on adaptation and resilience to disturbance. Drought and heatwaves are common occurrences across large parts of the region and can tip an ecosystem's carbon budget from a net CO2 sink to a net CO2 source. Despite such responses to stress, ecosystems at OzFlux sites show their resilience to climate variability by rapidly pivoting back to a strong carbon sink upon the return of favourable conditions. Located in under-represented areas, OzFlux data have the potential for reducing uncertainties in global remote sensing products, and these data provide several opportunities to develop new theories and improve our ecosystem models. The accumulated impacts of these lessons over the last 20 years highlights the value of long-term flux observations for natural and managed systems. A future vision for OzFlux includes ongoing and newly developed synergies with ecophysiologists, ecologists, geologists, remote sensors and modellers."

"A Special Ancient Bronze Sword and Its Possible Manufacturing Technique from Materials Science Analysis Artifact; Atacamite; Tin-Bronze In this study, it was found that an ancient bronze sword had special microstructures, i.e., a tin (Sn)-rich layer (Sn: 38.51 wt.%), that was around 0.1â€“0.3 mm in thickness in the bronze substrate (Sn: 18.57 wt.%). This sword was unearthed from the same Chu tombs of the â€œSword of Gou Jianâ€, and dated back to the late Spring and Autumn Period (496 BCâ€“464 BC). The experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that (1) the Sn-rich layer exhibited higher microhardness (around 650 HV) than the sword body (around 300 HV); (2) the Sn-rich layer showed a brittle fracture due to the formation of a large amount of Î± + Î´ eutectoid, while the sword body was of good toughness due to a large amount of Î±-Cu solid solution phase; and (3) theoretical calculations of Sn diffusion in the Cu substrate indicated that this Sn-rich layer could have been formed within several hours or several days if the temperature was above 600â—¦ C. Therefore, this sword was proposed to be a novel kind of composite bronze sword, and the possible manufacturing technique was a surface treatment called â€œdip or wipe tinningâ€ or tin amalgam, which was widely used in the Bronze Age. Technically, this process possesses more advantages than the well-known two-times casting for making the â€œdouble-colourâ€ or bi-metallic composite bronze sword. This research showed that the materials processing level was beyond our expectations for ancient China 2500 years ago."
"A water-based pressure casting method for transtibial prosthetic socket fit in developing countries Amputation; Lower Extremity; Prosthetic Fitting Many challenges are faced by large numbers of people with lower limb amputation in developing countries. Foremost are cost and access to skilled prosthetic services. Attempts have been made to develop socket fabrication techniques that require little or no prosthetic skill. This study investigated a water pressure casting technique (PCAST) to fabricate and fit transtibial (TT) prosthetic sockets. Ethics approval and informed consent were obtained. Fifty-three adults with unilateral TT amputation were recruited from VIETCOT (Hanoi). VIETCOT staff with ISPO category II qualifications fabricated and fitted the prostheses. Firstly, a cotton sock was placed over the residual limb followed by a plaster wrap. The participant stood with the intact limb on a weight-scale and placed the residual limb into a plastic bag-type diaphragm housed in a cylindrical tank filled with water until they stood normally with half body weight supported. Upon hardening a positive plaster model was made and a socket fabricated with a distal pelite cap. A polypropylene socket was then moulded and attached to ICRC prosthetic components and a rubber foot. The same person fabricated, fitted and aligned the prosthesis. Once a participant indicated satisfaction, the following tasks were completed: timed up-and-go (TUG), six-minute walk (6MWT), walking (GAITRite mat) and satisfaction questionnaire (SATPRO). These tasks were also completed after an extended usage period (146 Â± 28 days). Thirty-one of the participants were successfully fitted: fourteen fits failed, eight failed to return, withdrew or became deceased. SATPRO (n = 31) showed high levels of satisfaction (81%) on both test occasions. 6MWT increased by 28 m (p = 0.01) after the usage period. TUG, SATPRO and gait measures remained unchanged. A sub-analysis (n = 21) compared PCAST performance to original socket and prosthesis. No differences were found. In conclusion, the PCAST may assist people with TT amputation in developing countries."

"AVOIDING THE WHOLESALE DE-BANKING OF CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGES IN AUSTRALIA Anti-Money Laundering; Crime; Financial Crimes De-banking is the closure of banking facilities by a bank for reasons such as a risk of money laundering. De-banking the Australian Cryptocurrency Exchange (â€˜Crypto Exchangeâ€™) industry could mean that Australian banks fall foul of competition law. In 2021, an Australian Senate inquiry investigated how to regulate cryptocurrencies, including considering de-banking. This article outlines a possible system that reduces the risk to banks of providing banking services to the Australian Crypto Exchange industry. Regulators should continue to adopt a collaborative market governance approach, working with cryptocurrency financial technologies to survey Crypto Exchange operating models. Then they should create an operating model licensing regime and updated Crypto Exchange-specific anti-money laundering (â€˜AMLâ€™) compliance frameworks. That regime would differentiate both centralised and decentralised; and custodian and non-custodian Crypto Exchanges, streamlining this licensing regime for banks. An AML-compliant self-certification system for Crypto Exchanges unable to be licensed is another suggestion. On 20 October 2021, the final Senate Inquiry Report also recommended a similar licensing regime."
"DIY Entrepreneurship? – Self-reliance for Women Refugees in Australia Migrant Workers; Self-Employment; Ethnic Business In this paper, we call for a re-examination of the self-reliance ideology based on a neoliberal perspective to make policies for refugee women's (self-)employment and integration. We use a social constructionist perspective to conduct a narrative analysis of data from the lived experience of twelve women refugee entrepreneurs. Three prominent themes emerge from the womenâ€™s own narratives of their entrepreneurial journey â€“ self-reconstruction, social capital, and resilience. Our findings reveal the complexities of self-reconstruction and socialization as experienced by refugee women entrepreneurs â€“ for whom â€œpushâ€ factors take precedence over â€œpullâ€ factors with the explicit understanding that the onus is on them to survive with their own resilience. We argue that offering people hope of a new life means offering them meaningful choices, built on forms of economic activity whose sustainability over the long term is evidenced by the positive supports available to make sure economic activity succeeds."
"Relationality and Economic Empowerment: The Role of Men in Supporting and Undermining Women’s Pathways Papua New Guinea; Tok Pisin; Initiation Rituals Within development projects, empowerment is often construed in narrow terms, and increasingly in relation to economic empowerment. Feminist scholars have recently argued the need to bring back a more encompassing view of empowerment, which pays greater attention to relationality and changes in consciousness. In this article, we focus on one aspect of relationalityâ€“womenâ€™s relationships with men. Drawing on three case studies of womenâ€™s business success in Papua New Guinea, we argue men are pivotal in supporting and undermining womenâ€™s economic opportunities. Offering support to recent work on womenâ€™s empowerment which emphasizes both womenâ€™s relationships with men, and the specificity of contexts into account, our article contributes to current debates in gender and development."
"Identification, classification and quantification of microplastics in road dust and stormwater Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Microplastics (MP) have become a major emerging class of pollutants representing significant eco-toxicological risks for ecosystems and marine environments. The aim of this study was to identify, classify and quantify MP present in both road dust and stormwater samples. A significantly higher level of MPs within road dust samples was detected from industrial area (1130 particles/kg of dust) than from residential area (520 particles/kg of dust), while stormwater samples from industrial and residential sites yielded 26 particles/L and 17 particles/L, respectively. Fiber-like shape accounted for 53% and 74% in road dust and stormwater samples, respectively. The main polymeric materials collected for both road dust and stormwater samples were, in order of occurrence (i) low-density polyethylene, (ii) high-density polyethylene, (iii) polypropylene, (iv) polyethylene terephthalate, (v) polystyrene, (vi) polyester and (vii) poly (amide). Most of the MP had an average maximum dimension smaller than 2 mm for both road dust and stormwater samples. The results from this study demonstrates that road dust is a significant contributor to MP pollution through direct polymeric materials wear off and transfer through stormwater, which eventually will end up in open water ways and broader ecological niches."
"A Lossless Data-Hiding based IoT Data Authenticity Model in Edge-AI for Connected Living Diagnostic Imaging; Steganography; Data Hiding Edge computing is an emerging technology for the acquisition of Internet-of-Things (IoT) data and provisioning different services in connected living. Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered edge devices (edge-AI) facilitate intelligent IoT data acquisition and services through data analytics. However, data in edge networks are prone to several security threats such as external and internal attacks and transmission errors. Attackers can inject false data during data acquisition or modify stored data in the edge data storage to hamper data analytics. Therefore, an edge-AI device must verify the authenticity of IoT data before using them in data analytics. This article presents an IoT data authenticity model in edge-AI for a connected living using data hiding techniques. Our proposed data authenticity model securely hides the data source's identification number within IoT data before sending it to edge devices. Edge-AI devices extract hidden information for verifying data authenticity. Existing data hiding approaches for biosignal cannot reconstruct original IoT data after extracting the hidden message from it (i.e., lossy) and are not usable for IoT data authenticity. We propose the first lossless IoT data hiding technique in this article based on error-correcting codes (ECCs). We conduct several experiments to demonstrate the performance of our proposed method. Experimental results establish the lossless property of the proposed approach while maintaining other data hiding properties."

"Whole of meat supply chain waste mapping and interventions – Phase 1 The project will quantify meat waste generation in Australian meat supply chains, identify the root causes
of waste generation, and propose solutions that can be adopted by industry. It will fill significant gaps in
data about the volumes and costs of meat waste, to inform the co-development of waste reduction
opportunities with industry and government partners. It is Phase 1 of a larger 3-phased project, focusing
on the upstream production stages (farm to retail door) for one meat product (beef). Subsequent phases
will expand into other meat types (lamb, pork, chicken) and the downstream consumption stages,
informed by another FFW CRC project “Consumer fridge behaviour and waste reduction of red meat”. The
benefits to the red meat industry from this Phase 1 project will be identification of large cost saving
opportunities for actors in the supply chain from meat waste solutions, a workforce more skilled in
resource efficiency, and increased collaboration and transparency along the supply chain to unlock
innovation. The benefits for society will be reductions in the environmental impacts of meat products
(particularly GHG emissions), helping maintain the meat industry’s social licence to operate and its longterm capacity for it to contribute to Australia’s economy.

"Public satisfaction with urban trees and their management in Australia: The roles of values, beliefs, knowledge, and trust Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure The success of urban forest management strategies is dependent on public support for and engagement with urban trees. Satisfaction with urban trees and their management, and the level of trust people have in urban tree managers, are useful for understanding public opinions. Yet these concepts, and the mechanisms leading to the formation of public opinions remain poorly explored in the literature. Here we explore how satisfaction with urban trees and with urban tree management, and trust in the agencies responsible for urban tree management, are explained by cognitive factors (values, beliefs, and knowledge) and socio-ecological contextual factors (tree presence/canopy cover, cultural diversity, and socioeconomic status) using an online survey of 16 local government areas in south-eastern Australia. Analyses of 2367 responses revealed that people's opinions about trees in general (values and beliefs) were overwhelmingly positive, while their opinions about more contextualised measures such as satisfaction and trust were more mixed. Two distinct pathways that influence satisfaction were identified: one linked to beliefs about having trees in cities, and another one linked to trust in urban tree management. At the local government level, satisfaction was negatively associated with a measure of cultural diversity and very low levels of tree canopy cover, but not with socioeconomic disadvantage. Satisfaction with local trees could be improved by increasing the quality of ecological function of trees, such as habitat provision and tree diversity. Community engagement could also improve satisfaction and trust, particularly perceived procedural fairness of decision-making, reinforce positive beliefs about the outcomes of having trees in cities, and dispel negative beliefs. Engagement processes should recognise that people hold complex and diverse opinions about urban trees, and by incorporating these opinions into decision-making we can meet the increasingly complex and diverse expectations being placed on urban forests."

"Musical genius and/or nasty piece of work? Dealing with violence and sexual assault in accounts of popular music’s past Cultural Heritage; Archival Science; Forms and Records Control For many years, the mistreatment of women in particular has essentially been normalized in many parts of the music industry. In recent years, however, there has been an increase in women coming forward and telling their stories, and asking that men be held accountable for wrongdoing. This interdisciplinary (sociology and philosophy) paper pursues two key feminist questions prompted by recent developments. Firstly: How has the construction of the history of popular music legitimated the continuation of this situation? â€˜Looking backâ€™ historically and sociologically, examples are provided of the legitimation or ignoring of violence against women (VAW) in the history of popular music to date. Secondly: How should we [archivists, historians, heritage curators and popular music educators], from now on, construct the history of popular music in a way that doesnâ€™t legitimate VAW? Turning to â€˜look forwardâ€™, applied ethics frameworks are used to explore different aspects of this second question."
"Image-Based Sexual Abuse: An Australian Reflection Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica Digital technologies are increasingly being used to abuse, harass, and victimize women. Image-based sexual abuse (IBSA)â€”the nonconsensual taking or sharing (including threats to share) nude or sexual imagesâ€”is one such form of abuse. Various jurisdictions have enacted laws criminalizing IBSA, but Australia is arguably leading the way, with eight of its nine jurisdictions introducing innovative IBSA laws. This article explores the Australian laws, focusing on their capacity to address the gendered nature of IBSA. While highlighting the importance of these laws, we argue that a multifaceted approach is required to combat IBSA that includes law reform, education, and training."
"Congruence of market orientation and organizational learning: Performance perspective Market Orientation; Marketing Capabilities; Innovation The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between market orientation, organizational learning and organizational performance. The study follows quantitative research strategy and cross-sectional survey design to collect data from manufacturing firms operating in Pakistan. Regression analysis and structural equation modeling techniques are used to analyze data. Results indicate that both market orientation and organizational learning significantly affect organizational performance. Additionally, customer orientation and inter-functional coordination are also positively related with all dimensions of organizational learning. Competitor orientation is significantly related with only knowledge interpretation dimension of organizational learning. This research explains how customer knowledge and competitor knowledge is instrumental towards an organization's learning behavior. This research is valuable to practitioners as they can learn how customer knowledge can provide them with multiple opportunities to create superior value. Similarly, competitor related knowledge is instrumental in drawing a competitive strategy to win customers. This paper is novel as it confirms market orientation as an antecedent of organizational learning. Furthermore, the paper explores significant implications of components of market orientation for organizational learning sub-processes."

"Recent trends in the synthesis of graphene and graphene oxide based nanomaterials for removal of heavy metals — A review Multi Walled Nanotube; Adsorption; Graphene Oxide The advanced synthesis and development of raw graphene based on various significant functionalization has been outstanding in the wastewater treatment compared to the other alternatives such as carbon nanotubes and other carbon nanomaterials. Nano size graphene is known to possess large surface area and some promising properties in terms of mechanical, electrical, chemical and magnetism. Besides, the graphene can be generated via both Top-down and Bottom-up methods such as chemical exfoliation, chemical vapour deposition and other techniques so that it can be further functionalized to form graphene oxide-based nanomaterials. Hence, graphene oxide-based nanomaterials are discovered to be useful in the application of heavy metal removal from wastewater. In short, this paper critically reviewed on the synthesis method of graphene and application of graphene oxide-based nanomaterials in the term of heavy metal removal. The advantages, drawbacks, comparison of the data efficiencies, and research requirements are further highlighted, elaborated and discussed detailly. Lastly, the future challenges of graphene are elaborated. Therefore, it can be guaranteed that the wastewater discharged should be detected with the minimum or none of the heavy metals so that minimum effects on the ecosystem is discovered."
"Safety evaluation and ibuprofen removal via an Alternanthera philoxeroides-based biochar Multi Walled Nanotube; Adsorption; Graphene Oxide Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are a representative class of emerging contaminants. This study aimed to investigate the PPCP removal performance and application safety of a biochar fabricated using the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides (APBC). According to scanning electron microscopy and pore size analyses, APBC exhibited a porous structure with a specific surface area of 857.5 m2/g. A Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated the presence of surface functional groups, including phosphorus-containing groups, C=O, C=C, and â€“OH. The adsorption experiment showed that the maximum removal efficiency of ibuprofen was 97% at an initial concentration of 10 mg/L and APBC dosage of 0.8 g/L. The adsorption kinetics were fitted by the pseudo-second-order model with the highest correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9999). The adsorption isotherms were well described by the Freundlich model (R2 = 0.9896), which indicates a dominant multilayer adsorption. The maximum adsorption capacity of APBC was 172 mg/g. A toxicity evaluation, based on Chlorella pyrenoidosa and human epidermal BEAS-2B cells, was carried out using a spectrum analysis, thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay, and flow cytometry. The results of the above showed the low cytotoxicity of APBC and demonstrated its low toxicity in potential environmental applications."
"The “Gender Agenda” in Agriculture for Development and Its (Lack of) Alignment With Feminist Scholarship Farmers; Women in Agriculture; Farm Families Sustainable food systems require sustainable agriculture. To achieve this, we argue, inclusive approaches are required that incorporate the voices and lived experiences of diverse social groups. In agriculture-based international development efforts (known as Agriculture for Development or A4D), it is increasingly being recognized that sustainable agriculture requires attention to gendered power relations. In the past, gender inequality has been a major barrier to developing inclusive, sustainable food systems, and continues to be so today. At the same time, however, gender is increasingly â€œon the agendaâ€ in A4D. Yet what sort of agenda is being promoted and to what extent does it reflect progress in feminist scholarship? We examine the burgeoning â€œgender agendaâ€ through the lens of policy materials produced by prominent A4D organizations. In doing so, we find problematic narratives that instrumentalise women in the name of sustainable agricultural development. However, we also find other more transformative discourses that, in troubling the drivers of gender inequality and promoting shared responsibility for change, reflect a deeper awareness of feminist scholarship. In any effort to advance sustainable agriculture, further progress is needed to address the myriad ways gender pervades not just development settings but development institutions and donor nations, and contributes to the production of as well as responses to global A4D challenges."

"Entrepreneurial Finance: Insights from English Language Training Market in Vietnam Financial Management; Venture Capital; Private Equity Entrepreneurship plays an indispensable role in the economic development and poverty reduction of emerging economies like Vietnam. The rapid development of technologies during the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) has a significant impact on business in every field, especially in the innovation-focused area of entrepreneurship. However, the topic of entrepreneurial activities with technology applications in Vietnam is under-researched. In addition, the body of literature regarding entrepreneurial finance tends to focus on advanced economies, while mostly neglecting the contextual differences in developing nations. Therefore, this research contributes to these topics by investigating the main characteristics of a high potential market for entrepreneurs in Vietnam, which is the English language training market (ELTM). It also aims at indicating the impacts of technology on the entrepreneurial firms within this market, with an emphasis on financing sources. To answer the research questions, this study employs a qualitative analysis and conducts 12 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs and researchers in the field. The key findings in our study highlight the main contributing factors to the growth of the market, both universally and context-specific for a developing nation like Vietnam. It also lists the leaders in each market segment and the industryâ€™s potential profit margin. The results also show that most entrepreneurs in the ELTM utilized private sources of finance rather than external ones, such as bank loans. It again confirms the idea from previous works that even with the rapid development of the economic and technological landscape, entrepreneurial activities in general barely benefit from additional sources of funding. However, it also points out the distinct characteristics of the ELTM that may influence these financing issues; for example, English training services usually collect revenues from customers before delivering their classes. This is of advantage for entrepreneurs in this area and helps significantly reduce the financial barriers. These findings, which are among the first attempts to contribute to a better understanding of entrepreneurial opportunities in the Industry 4.0 in Vietnam, provide valuable insights for policymakers and entrepreneurs, as well as investors."
"Corrigendum: The Art of Tacit Learning in Serious Location-Based Games(Front. Educ., (2021), 6, (686633), 10.3389/feduc.2021.686633) - In the original article, there was an error. The name of the project â€œPet Playing for Placemakingâ€ was inconsistently used. A correction has been made to Case Studies, Pet Playing for Placemaking: A Mobile Location-based Game (2020 - Present), paragraphs 1, 2. Developed by Jacob Sheahan in partnership with the Cherished Pets Foundation, Pet Playing for Placemaking is a location-based game created to support the social engagement of vulnerable older pet owners in a post-pandemic reality. Funded with a Community Connections Grant through the GiveWhere You Live Foundation to reduce social isolation and support the social participation of vulnerable community members. Pet Playing for Placemaking is primarily a social and supportive experience. Responding to the isolation and social restrictions on vulnerable and older members of the Ocean Grove pet-owning community due to the COVID19 pandemic, this serious location-based game takes an innovative approach to the support and education of pet ownership in the community. The game invites older pet owners and local community members to partner up and compete in treasure-hunt style gameplay. Older pet owners, limited in mobility and vulnerable to the virus, must complete digital puzzles which reveal locations where their play partner (typically a volunteer or neighbour) can walk their pet and discovermore challenges that lead to other places (Figures 6â€“8). Co-operation iscritical, with each player supporting the other with their limitations. For example, older pet owners may have low technology literacy and require support to learn these features on their devices. At the same time, their fellow player may need local know-how and guidance to find the hidden locations and look after the pet in their care. The gameplay presents playful scenarios as content through digital-physical mechanics, encouraging players to explore such themes through play and engage with others in their local community. In the original article, there was an error. The name of the project â€œPet Playing for Placemakingâ€ was inconsistently used."
"Assessing multi-climate-hazard threat in the coastal region of Bangladesh by combining influential environmental and anthropogenic factors Bangladesh; Cyclonic Storms; Disaster This study developed a geo-spatial framework for assessing multi-hazard threat on the Bangladesh coast, integrating environmental hazards (EH), geo-environmental attributes (GA), and anthropogenic modifications (AM) based on their potential contribution to overall threat. For this purpose, a fuzzy logic based analytical technique was integrated with geospatial mapping. Thematic layers were prepared for twenty-three theoretically important factors representing the three components of threat. The spatial variations of threat and its components were delineated through spatial overlaying of the respective layers in a GIS environment. The final threat map revealed 32% (5338 km2) and 4% (646 km2) of the area of the western deltaic coast, which encompassed >50â€“60% of the areas of Khulna, Bagerhat, and Satkhira districts, was under high and very high threat, respectively, owing primarily to frequent cyclones, salinity ingression, and subsidence, and secondarily to the low elevation of the coast, high astronomical tide, shallow bathymetry, excessive groundwater extraction, and polder construction. High and very high threat zones within the central estuarine coast corresponded to 27% (4518 km2) and 16% (2618 km2) of the area, including most of Bhola, Barguna, and Patuakhali districts, which was attributable to the effects of coastal erosion, sea-level rise, flooding and the ancillary effects of strong wave action, high river discharge, deforestation, and land transformation. Around 14% (948 km2) and 3% (164 km2) of the eastern cliff coast, comprising the southwestern part of the Coxsbazar district, was found to be under high and very high threat, respectively, due to the direct effects of sea-level rise, storm surge, erosion, and indirect effects of closeness to the shoreline, alluvial composition of the beach, tourism, and pollution from industries. The outcomes of this study could guide the coastal managers of Bangladesh in prioritizing actions aimed at disaster risk reduction and sustainable development of this region."
"Numerical assessment of respiratory airway exposure risks to diesel exhaust particles Aerosol; Dry Powder Inhalers; Particle Transport Exposure to ambient air pollution presents great adverse health risks to respiratory health, and assessing the respiratory exposure doses, especially in the human deep lung regions, remains difficult due to the sheer complexity of the process. To bridge this gap, an extended large-to-small conducting lung airway model was adopted in this study, which includes a broad scope containing bronchial airways up to the 15th generation. Accumulation mode particles in the size range of 100 nm to 3.0 Î¼m representing major size spectrum of coarse diesel exhaust were released at the inlet of respiratory airway model, and both airflow and particle deposition characteristics were numerically investigated. The simulation results showed that the particle deposition in the respiratory airway is sensitive to the variation of inhalation flow rates. For inhalation exposure at lower breathing rate of 18 L/min, both deposited diffusive and inertia particles were very unevenly distributed in the lower respiratory airway. For inhalation exposure at higher breathing rate of 50 L/min, deposited diffusive and inertia particles were both scattered over the lower respiratory airway. In addition, high inhalation flow rate enabled inertia particles to be deposited further d ownstream of the airway with deposition hot spots observed in distal airways."

"Quandamooka Aboriginal women on the colonial frontier in the nineteenth century Quandamooka Aboriginal women on the colonial frontier in the nineteenth century. This project aims to produce new insights about gender and race on the colonial frontier in Australia through revealing Aboriginal women's agency beyond the usual themes of labour and sexual exploitation. The historical record has too often represented Aboriginal women as victims, which has affected self-esteem and caused poor health and social alienation. This project will research how Aboriginal women resisted and negotiated with colonisation by examining the everyday and public performances of Quandamooka women on their own lands, Moreton Bay, Queensland, in the nineteenth century. The project aims to benefit the health and well-being of Aboriginal women."
"Investor reactions to key audit matters: Financial and non-financial contexts Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative We investigate how a disclosed risk item and key audit matter (KAM) relatedness combine to affect investors' riskiness assessment in financial and non-financial contexts. When management disclose a high-risk item, we find that investors react the same way across contexts with KAM relatedness having no effect. When management disclose a low-risk item, investors react differently in each context. When a KAM is related to the disclosed financial (non-financial) low-risk item, investors assess investment riskiness higher (lower) than when a KAM is unrelated to the low-risk item. Our findings indicate the varying communicative value of KAMs across financial and non-financial contexts."

"A Review on Water-Energy-Greenhouse Gas Nexus of the Bioenergy Supply and Production System Biomass; Supply Chain Design; Biomass Power Purpose of Review: Tremendous global pressures like resource depletion and climate change urge us to deploy alternate energy sources and to integrate carbon capture and sequestration processes. Biomass can be considered as one of the alternate renewable carbon-based fuels that can decrease environmental footprints in different applications. There is currently a lack of systematic review of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water-energy nexus (WEN) in the biomass supply chainsâ€™ system (BSCs) system. Therefore, the present study aims to conduct a comprehensive review of the studies carried out into WEN and GHG emissions regarding the BSCs. The published papers investigated in this study were categorized and evaluated based on their objectives, methodologies, geographic scales, and environmental sustainability factors. Recent Findings: The review revealed that not only literatures lack enough research into WEN and GHG, but also the capacity for effectively assessing the relationships between water, energy, and the trend of GHG emissions at a higher resolution. In addition, it was found that most of the previous studies have mainly focused on the economic influences of BSCs and mathematical methods for the optimization of BSCs. There is a need for the development of a mathematical dynamic model considering uncertainties and the multi-objective approaches to evaluate the trend of WEN and GHG in the BSCs. Summary: To achieve a sustainable development of the BSCs, WEN and GHG emissions need to be effectively managed. The findings of the present paper will assist researchers who work on renewable energy issues and potential users of the bioenergy industry to obtain a deeper understanding of the current state of knowledge in terms of WEN and GHG emission."

"Creating evidence-based public open space standards for apartment residents The rise in apartment living represents a fundamental shift in the way Australians live. With less private and communal space, residents are hypothesised to rely on public spaces for physical, social and recreational activities. Yet, little is known about which spaces apartment residents use and why. This project aims to generate new knowledge on: (1) public open space use by apartment dwellers, including which spaces are used and why; and (2) test whether public open space use compensates for reduced apartment/building space. Findings will be used to create tailored, equitable evidence-based recommendations for public open space planning and apartment design guidelines."
"Informal Networks, Informal Institutions, and Social Exclusion in the Workplace: Insights from Subsidiaries of Multinational Corporations in Korea Guanxi; China; Managerial Ties Drawing on interviews with decision makers in multinational corporations (MNCs) in South Korea, we examine the role of informal networks in the social exclusion of women in the workforce. Although legislation in the country is in favor of gender equality, we found that informal barriers in the workplace remain difficult to overcome. Informal networks in Korea, yongo, present an ethical issue in the workplace, as they tend to socially exclude women, limiting possibilities for their participation and career progression. We found that informal networks are pervasive and strong because of the informal institutions in which they are embedded and that there is a complex interplay between informal networks and informal institutions that socially excludes women. Due to difficulties accessing yongo, women appear to build inmaek, a network type that is more open and accessible. We also found that MNCs in Korea can compensate for the lack of local informal networks for their female employees. However, despite providing a more supportive environment for women at work, gender equality policies in MNCs are not yet as effective as they could be due to the dynamics of the workplace and the fact that the policies are not tailored to the local context. We have seen evidence in recent years that MNCs can serve as role models for implementing gender equality policies by creating a more inclusive work environment and demonstrating leadership commitment and support."
"Encapsulation in egg white protein nanoparticles protects anti-oxidant activity of curcumin Curcumin; Demethoxycurcumin; Nanocrystal This study investigated the encapsulation of curcumin into egg white protein (EWP) nanoparticles. Processing conditions used to formulate the nanoparticles, including pH and the addition of ethanol, were used to control the unfolding and aggregation behavior of EWP. The curcumin loading capacity of the EWP nanoparticles was found to be strongly linked to the structural transitions of the protein during heat denaturation, and the microscopic properties of the particles such as particle size and zeta-potential. Fibrous particles were formed at lower pH (3.0) and were associated with a higher curcumin loading than the granular particles formed at pH 3.8. Ethanol leads to an increase in Î²-sheet structure, and the formation of a coarser gel structure during heat denaturation, resulted in an increase in particle diameter. The highest curcumin loading capacities were 11.53 and 9.89 mg/g protein (with a final curcumin concentration of 312.5 Î¼M and 268 Î¼M respectively), at pH 3.0 and 3.8, respectively. Encapsulation in EWP nanoparticles was shown to both effectively slow the degradation ratio as well as protect the antioxidant activity of encapsulated curcumin."
"Inferring extinction year using a Bayesian approach Animals; Campephilus Principalis; Extinct Species Species sighting records are combined with statistical models to infer whether an endangered species might have become extinct, or instead has just gone unobserved for a lengthy period of time. The challenging part of developing these models lies in dealing with uncertain sightings. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical approach to infer the extinction time of a species based on historical sighting records which may be either certain or uncertain. The posterior distribution for extinction time is evaluated using the likelihood of sighting data and non-informative priors for model parameters. All the models discussed in this paper are implemented in JAGS, a program for analysing Bayesian models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. A general methodology is presented and then applied to the sighting record of the ivory-billed woodpecker (IBW) Campephilus principalis. It was found that the IBW most likely went extinct between 1940 and 1945, a little after the date of the last certain sighting. The methods developed were also applied to other species sighting records as well as some artificial sighting records. Through the results, it was found that the inferred time of extinction is significantly influenced by the last certain sighting if the sighting record consists of only certain sightings. In the presence of uncertain sightings, the inferred extinction time is influenced by either the last certain sighting or the time when the uncertain sighting rate drops."

"Biological Control of the Noxious Weed Angled Onion (Allium triquetrum) Thwarted by Endophytic Bacteria in Victoria, Australia Quorum Sensing; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa; N-Octanoylhomoserine Lactone The noxious weed Allium triquetrum (Alliaceae) has invaded widespread areas in southern Australia, forming dense monocultures that threaten indigenous ground flora. Two soilborne biocontrol agents, the fungus Stromatinia cepivora and the bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Pcc) have previously been reported as killing A. triquetrum in gnotobiotic controlled conditions. This study aimed to find why glasshouse pot trials in complex potting media and field trials showed no effect of inoculation with either agent. Bacteria were consistently isolated from inside surface-sterilised bases and bulbs of A. triquetrum. Most bacteria from actively growing plants were closely related to Bacillus but one from dormant bulbs (RPTAtOch1) belonged to Ochrobactrum. Most bacteria reduced soft rot caused by Pcc in vitro by up to 100% when inoculated the day before Pcc. Co-cultivation with Pcc reduced its extracellular pectin lyase and polygalacturonase, which target plant cell walls. RPTAtOch1 was identified as O. quorumnocens by traditional physiological, biochemical and molecular tests, whole genome sequencing and Average Nucleotide Identity comparisons. Its draft genome consisted of 76 contigs, 70% of which were closest to isolate A44 of O. quorumnocens, which antagonises soft rotting of potato by Pcc by destroying its quorum-sensing lactones but, like RPTAtOch1, does not inhibit growth of Pcc. Also, endophytic bacteria inhibited germination of S. cepivora sclerotia and so prevented white rot. Thus, the failure in biocontrol of A. triquetrum by both S. cepivora and Pcc may be due, ironically, to biocontrol of the intended pathogens by endophytic bacteria inside the target weed."
"Making raw materials: innovation and imported technology in Meiji Japan Great Divergence; Republican China; China This article explores coal and wood manufacturing in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan as the empirical sites for understanding the material gaps between industrial inputs available locally and the affordances of imported technology. It demonstrates how the process of making coking coals for steel smelting and wooden boards for furniture-making challenge a conceptual framework that assumes that raw materials exist on one side of a binary and manufactured goods on the other. Instead, this article foregrounds the creative ways in which actors approached, redesigned and manufactured raw materials locally, to make them comply with the constraints of imported technologies. In doing so, the article provides a useful counterbalance to scholarly explorations that anchor modern Japan in notions of technology transfer and appropriation, thus failing to recognize the creative labour necessary to making imported technologies work on local ground. By focussing on the labour of matching materials to hardware, this article restores to the historical record the creativity and innovation that formed the fabric of the first wave of Japanâ€™s industrialisation and nuances our understanding of raw materials in the history of technology in general."
"‘Neutral’ Representations of Pacific Islands in the IPCC Special Report of 1.5°C Global Warming Climate Change; Decision to Migrate; Small Islands Pacific Islands are facing some of the most immediate and direct impacts of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report of 1.5Â°C Global Warming (SR15) outlines the possibility that some low-lying atolls will become uninhabitable by 2030 and submerged by 2100. I analyse how and where SR15 presents climate change impacts for Pacific Islands. In doing so, I seek to highlight to what extent the IPCCâ€™s structures and pressures influence SR15â€™s marginalisation of or emphasis on Pacific perspectives and challenges. The main findings that emerge from this discourse analysis are, first, that climate change impacts for Pacific Islands are largely conceptualised as relating to the physical environment and the economy. Second, SR15 frames Pacific Islands as vulnerable; however, it appears to be reflecting a shift in the literature toward recognising Pacific adaptation and resilience. The third finding is that the IPCC explicitly defines and acknowledges Indigenous and local knowledge but frames this knowledge as alternative to scientific expertise. I interpret these findings in the context of the underrepresentation of Pacific authors, the availability of published knowledge for assessment and the IPCCâ€™s claims of neutrality. Pacific leaders and communities continue to advocate for the 1.5Â°C threshold investigated in SR15 and are mobilising IPCC assessments."
"The asymmetric role of crime in women's and men's labour force participation: Evidence from India Agriculture; Mahatma Gandhi; Sample Survey Increased crime incidents, particularly crime against women, raise security concerns and increase the non-pecuniary cost of travelling, thus deterring women from working away from their dwelling. This raises the possibility that if crime reduces women's labour force participation, men may compensate for the loss of income by increasing their participation in the labour force. Therefore, an increase in crime can explain and exacerbate the existing gender gaps in labour force participation. We investigated the possible asymmetric impact of crime on the labour force participation rates of men and women in India. We combined labour market data from NSS surveys on employment and unemployment and crime statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau for a panel of India's 571 districts from 2000 to 2012. We found that men's labour force participation increased or remained unimpacted by an increase in crime, while an increase in crime decreased women's labour force participation, especially in work away from their residence. These contrasting effects of crime on labour force participation rates are robust to fixed and between effects across districts, the dynamic nature of the relationship between variables, and heterogeneity in the data."

"Iron-doped zinc oxide for photocatalyzed degradation of humic acid from municipal wastewater Malachite Green; Adsorption; Methyl Orange Degradation of natural organic matter especially Humic acid is a big challenge, while its byproducts are carcinogenic, which is a threat to life. Here, Fe3+:ZnO has been deployed on ceramic plats (CP) using SILAR method for solar photocatalytic mineralization of HA in municipal wastewater. Structural results show that ZnO and Fe3+:ZnO deployed over CP have an average crystallite size of 47.43 nm and 29.54 nm, respectively. Further, Fe3+ doping increased the conductivity of ZnO due to enhanced photon capturing ability and effective surface area. Almost 90% HA photodegradation was achieved at the reaction parameters optimized by response surface methodology. Owing to the strong interaction between negatively charged HA and positive zeta potential of ZnO@CP (24 mV) and Fe3+:ZnO@CP (26 mV). Moreover, a significant reduction in BOD (~73%), COD (~76%) and TOC (~63%) have been observed after solar photocatalytic treatment of municipal wastewater. In comparison, ZnO@CP hybrid removed HA (400 mgLâˆ’1) at the rate of 3.3 kgmâˆ’3dâˆ’1 with a lower reduction in BOD (~57%), COD (~45%) and TOC (~57%) than Fe3+:ZnO@CP, confirming that the Fe doping has tuned the bandgap and manipulated the active sites onto the surface of ZnO. Moreover, direct coating of photocatalyst over CP provided exceptional stability and reusability as a photocatalyst which maintained ~80% of its activity even after 14 cycles of wastewater treatment and only lose 29% of its activity after 22 cycles. Hence, by designing a photocatalyst adhered directly onto the ceramic (substrate) present the novel sustainable photocatalyst supported wastewater treatment systems at a large scale."
"Untreated rice husk ash incorporated high strength self-compacting concrete: Properties and environmental impact assessments Cement; Rice Hulls; Mortar The suitability of untreated rice husk ash (URHA) as a supplementary to the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and fine aggregates (FA) in high strength self-compacting concrete (SCC) was investigated in terms of mechanical properties as well as environmental impact assessments (EIA). In total, nine SCC mixes were prepared and investigated with various levels of URHA replacements to OPC and FA. Initially, the fresh and hardened properties of URHA incorporated SCC were determined. Further, EIAs were carried out considering eighteen different environmental impact indices for the optimum URHA incorporated SCC mixes to determine the most appropriate mix in terms of mechanical properties along with their environmental impacts. The experimental results reveal, URHA in the range of 10â€“15% can be used without compromising the fresh and hardened properties of SCC. The results of the EIAs are presented and discussed in terms of compressive strength to environmental indices ratios to normalise the comparison. The EIAs disclose that even through some of the mixes provide better performance in terms of certain environmental impact categories; especially CO2 emission, water pollution (fresh and marine) and ecotoxicity, their strength to environmental impact ratios are relatively low. Thus, it is recommended to select the optimum mix design of URHA incorporated high strength SCC in terms of mechanical properties and as well as EIA."
"Women as helpmates: the Japan Self-Defense Forces and gender Flexible Work; Japan; Symbolic Interactionism As the Japan Self-Defense Forces becomes â€˜closerâ€™ to everyday people, discourses surrounding military masculinities and femininities shift. This paper takes a â€˜curious feministâ€™ approach to the shifting significance of the JSDF and asks the question, â€˜What can the changing JSDF tell us about its relationship with women?â€™ I explore representations of women and men in three JSDF-related publicationsâ€“a matchmaking website that caters to male soldiers and women civilians, Jieitai Premium Club; a popular manga series drawn by a woman married to a JSDF man, Totsugeki Jiekan Zuma; and the monthly JSDF publication, Mamorâ€“and suggest that despite the ostensible pursuit of gender equality within the JSDF as evidenced in the increased recruitment of women, and the promoting of women to higher ranks, women continue to be imagined as â€˜helpmatesâ€™, just as they were during Japanâ€™s modernization process. They are discursively constructed as helpmates to men as wives and other female companions, and in being so constructed, become (un/conscious) supporters of the JSDF and thus helpmates to the state."
"The social life of HIV care: On the making of ‘care beyond the virus’ AIDS/HIV; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Antiretroviral Therapy Treating care as an effect of material implementations, we use qualitative interviews with people living with HIV in London, most of whom are migrants, to explore care practices linked to clinical treatment delivered as part of the â€˜cascade of HIV careâ€™. We consider how HIV care is done, and what HIV care does, drawing on assemblage theory. We ask how is care affected by the situations in which it is enacted? and what contingent forms of care does the HIV care cascade potentiate? A prime actor in the care assemblages revealed in our study is immigration, from which multiple uncertainties flow, including access to vital resources such as housing and income. Yet we also found that clinical HIV care is worked-with in practice to afford multiple forms of care. Here, viral care is translated into matters of vital concern to produce care which extends â€˜beyond the virusâ€™. Practices of care beyond the virus afford social protection, including through making-up social relations and networks, and novel modes of sociality. Friendship connections, community organisations and HIV clinics are among the key actors involved. Being attuned to how HIV care is made to matter helps generate new ways of knowing and doing care."
"Adaptive management in groundwater planning and development: A review of theory and applications Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework Adaptive management (AM) is an approach that uses targeted monitoring and investigation to improve future management practices in a structured and iterative way through reassessment of the efficacy of management policies and system understanding. AM has received significant attention in groundwater management for its purported capability to counteract key uncertainties inherent in estimating future environmental responses to human activities. While the theoretical strengths of AM have long been recognized, practical applications have produced mixed results across the many facets of environmental management. In this study, we review AM principles and groundwater management case studies, including urban water supply, agriculture and mining applications, to critically evaluate AM strategies applied to groundwater contexts. We identified substantial variability in the interpretation of AM principles across eleven groundwater case studies. Comparison of published AM guidelines and groundwater examples of AM plans revealed significant shortcomings in many AM applications, while a small number of AM plans largely adhere to the key components of AM identified in the guidelines. The most notable issues in the application of AM to groundwater activities include a lack of substantive mitigation measures and/or assessment of the potential for remediation. Construction of clear definitions and guidelines for AM applied to groundwater management is required to set the expectations of regulatory bodies and government departments responsible for assessing groundwater-affecting projects, and to ensure that the protective attributes of AM are properly incorporated into project plans. This will lead to greater transparency in groundwater related planning and expected outcomes for stakeholders."
"COVID-19, social isolation and the mental health of autistic people and their families: A qualitative study Psychological Support; Mindfulness; COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic and its policy responses have had a detrimental effect on millions of peopleâ€™s mental health. Here, we investigate its impact on autistic people and their families using qualitative methods. Specifically, we addressed: how did autistic people experience an increase in social isolation during the initial lockdown? And how was their mental health impacted by lockdown? Autistic and non-autistic researchers conducted 144 semi-structured interviews with autistic adults (n = 44), parents of autistic children (n = 84) including autistic parents and autistic young people (n = 16). We deployed thematic analysis to identify key themes. The enhanced social isolation accompanying the pandemic had a serious and damaging impact on autistic peopleâ€™s mental health and subjective wellbeing. They spoke of intensely missing friends and more incidental forms of social connection. They also reported intense dissatisfaction with the substitution of embodied, person-to-person connection in health services by online/telephone-based alternatives, sometimes accompanied by serious negative consequences. These findings reveal the fundamental importance of supporting autistic people to maintain direct and incidental social contact during the pandemic and beyond. They speak against established theories that downplay autistic peopleâ€™s need for human connection and the extent to which they have been affected by social isolation during lockdowns. Lay abstract: In this study, we show that autistic people and their families have found it very difficult to deal with the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Autistic and non-autistic researchers spoke to 144 people, including 44 autistic adults, 84 parents of autistic children and 16 autistic young people (12â€“18 years old). We asked them about their everyday lives and mental health during lockdown. People told us that they enjoyed having fewer obligations and demands compared to pre-COVID-19 life. They felt that life was quieter and calmer. But people also told us again and again how much they missed meeting people in real life, especially their friends, and their therapists and support workers. People told us that their mental health suffered because they did not have contact with their friends and services. Importantly, many people (including researchers) think that autistic people do not want friends or to be around people. But our results show that is not true. Many autistic people do want friends and to be around other people. Some peopleâ€™s mental health has been damaged by not being able to see people during COVID-19. Autistic people need support in many areas of life so they can keep socialising and seeing their friends even through difficult times, like pandemics."
"Evidence-driven dubious decision making in online shopping Decision Making; User Studies; Preference Elicitation Nowadays, Online shopping has been tremendous lifestyle choices due to the lower management cost for product/service providers and the cheaper prices for buyers/customers. Meanwhile, it raises a big challenge for both buyers and sellers to identify the right product items from the numerous choices and the right customers from a large number of different buyers. This motivates the study of recommendation system which computes recommendation scores for product items and filters out those with low scores. Recently, a promising direction involves the consideration of the social network influence in recommendation system. While significant performance improvement has been observed, it is still unclear to which extension the social network influence can help differentiate product items in terms of recommendation scores. This is an interesting problem in particular in the situation that the recommended product items have the highly similar (or identical) scores. As the first effort to this problem, this paper probes the boundary of social network influence to recommendation outputs by solving an optimization problem called evidence-driven dubious decision making. Two solutions have been proposed and the evaluation on two real world datasets has verified the effectiveness of the proposed solutions."
"Berbera Port Special Economic Zone: Golden Calf or Trojan Horse? Somalia; Horn of Africa; Failed States The African country of Somalia has been designated a â€˜failed stateâ€™ because of its persistent warfare, the presence of terrorist groups and the collapse of the central government. There is no effective rule of law and little protection of the private sector. The only real forms of income for the country are international assistance and remittances received from overseas Somalis. One possible means of increasing economic activity is to build a special economic zone in connection with Berbera Port, which has historically been an important trading centre linking East Africa and West Asia. Dubaiâ€™s DP World signed a contract to provide just such a development, but that agreement has subsequently been repudiated as a result of diplomatic issues. Meanwhile, China is seeking to extend its engagement in the region. Investment from either of these two sources would be problematic but it seems there are no other options available. Is it possible for Somalia to pursue a policy of economic development under current conditions without ceding sovereignty of its territory and its economic activities? Would it matter if this did happen? This case would be useful for students taking courses in international business or the political economy of international business."

"New public management and the rise of public sector performance audit: Evidence from the Australian case Public Sector; Auditors; Audit Office Purpose: In the context of global new public management reform trends and the associated phenomenon of performance auditing (PA), the purpose of this paper is to explore the rise of performance audit in Australia and examines its focus across audit jurisdictions and the role key stakeholders play in driving its practice. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a multi-jurisdictional analysis of PA in Australia to explore its scale and focus, drawing on the theoretical tools of Goffman. Documentary analysis and interview methods are employed. Findings: Performance audit growth has continued but not always consistently over time and across audit jurisdictions. Despite auditor discourse concerning backstage performance audit intentions being strongly focussed on evaluating programme outcomes, published front stage reports retain a strong control focus. While this appears to reflect Auditors-General (AGs) reluctance to critique government policy, nonetheless there are signs of direct and indirectly recursive relationships emerging between AGs and parliamentarians, the media and the public. Research limitations/implications: PA merits renewed researcher attention as it is now an established process but with ongoing variability in focus and stakeholder influence. Social implications: As an audit technology now well-embedded in the public sector accountability setting, it offers potential insights into matters of local, state and national importance for parliament and the public, but exhibits variable underlying drivers, agendas and styles of presentation that have the capacity to enhance or detract from the public interest. Originality/value: Performance audit emerges as a complex practice deployed as a mask by auditors in managing their relationship with key stakeholders."
"Invasive weed species’ threats to global biodiversity: Future scenarios of changes in the number of invasive species in a changing climate Maximum Entropy; Ecosystem; Environmental Space Invasive weed species (IWS) threaten ecosystems, the distribution of specific plant species, as well as agricultural productivity. Predicting the impact of climate change on the current and future distributions of these unwanted species forms an important category of ecological research. Our study investigated 32 globally important IWS to assess whether climate alteration may lead to spatial changes in the overlapping of specific IWS globally. We utilized the versatile species distribution model MaxEnt, coupled with Geographic Information Systems, to evaluate the potential alterations (gain/loss/static) in the number of potential ecoregion invasions by IWS, under four Representative Concentration Pathways, which differ in terms of predicted year of peak greenhouse gas emission. We based our projection on a forecast of climatic variables (extracted from WorldClim) from two global circulation models (CCSM4 and MIROC-ESM). Initially, we modeled current climatic suitability of habitat, individually for each of the 32 IWS, identifying those with a common spatial range of suitability. Thereafter, we modeled the suitability of all 32 species under the projected climate for 2050, incorporating each of the four Representative Concentration Pathways (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) in separate models, again examining the common spatial overlaps. The discrimination capacity and accuracy of the model were assessed for all 32 IWS individually, using the area under the curve and true skill statistic rate, with results averaging 0.87 and 0.75 respectively, indicating a high level of accuracy. Our final methodological step compared the extent of the overlaps and alterations under the current and future projected climates. Our results mainly predicted decrease on a global scale, in areas of habitat suitable for most IWS, under future climatic conditions, excluding European countries, northern Brazil, eastern US, and south-eastern Australia. The following should be considered when interpreting these results: there are many inherent assumptions and limitations in presence-only data of this type, as well as with the modeling techniques projecting climate conditions, and the envelopes themselves, such as scale and resolution mismatches, dispersal barriers, lack of documentation on potential disturbances, and unknown or unforeseen biotic interactions."
"Sustainability in fashion and textiles: A survey from developing country Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing The manufacturing of fashion and textiles involves many processes, which has high detrimental impact on the environment. The production of fashion and textile has been found to be one of the widely environmental polluting sectors. Environmental problems such as water and air pollution, generation of large amount of waste, use of a large amount of toxic chemicals and generation of large amount of wastewater are some of the problems associated with the fashion and textile production. Due to the increased global awareness to save the planet earth, many leading fashion brands have focused to reduce the pollution caused by the production of fashion and textiles. This chapter reviews the concepts of sustainability in fashion and textile production starting from fiber to the garment manufacturing, which can reduce pollution and achieve environmental sustainability. Furthermore, among different approaches taken to achieve environmental sustainability in the most impacting step, fabric chemical processing has been illustrated. The findings of a survey based on Vietnamâ€™s fashion and textile industries are also included in this chapter. We found that the large fashion enterprises are adopting fashion sustainability due to global competition, consumer awareness, and management policy, whereas the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are struggling to survive in the global market due to limited access to funding, lack of skilled people, and lack of consumer awareness."
"How do women entrepreneurs strategize growth? An investigation using the social feminist theory lens Migrant Workers; Self-Employment; Ethnic Business This paper explores the strategic success factors of fast-growth women entrepreneurs, explicating how their gendered strategies influence their growth paths. Drawing on social feminist theory, our qualitative study posits that a conscious choice of female perspective can be the central principle behind womenâ€™s entrepreneurial behavior and positively associated with growth. Our findings provide a more nuanced understanding of how women entrepreneurs weave together (economic) growth with personal and social outcomes, while shaping their key strategic success factorsâ€“client relationship and branding, organizational values and culture, networking behavior, and leadership and managementâ€“with female attributes and values attained through socialization."

"Novel biocompatible poly(acrylamide)-grafted-dextran hydrogels: Synthesis, characterization and biomedical applications Hydrogel; Algaroba; Glutaraldehyde An electro-responsive PAAm-g-Dxt copolymer was synthesized and characterized by 1 HNMR & FTIR spectroscopy, neutralization equivalent, elemental and thermogravimetric analysis to ascertain the grafting reaction. Further, we developed an electro-responsive transdermal drug delivery system (ETDS) utilizing PAAm-g-Dxt copolymer for rivastigmine tartarate delivery through skin. The ETDS were developed using drug-loaded PAAm-g-Dxt hydrogel as the reservoir, and cross-linked dextran-poly(vinyl alcohol) blend films as rate controlling membranes (RCM). In the absence of electrical stimuli, a small amount of drug was permeated from the ETDS, while in the presence of electrical stimuli, the drug permeability was increased. On application of electric stimulus, the flux was increased by 1.6 fold; drug permeability was enhanced when the strength of applied electric current was raised to 8 mA from 2 mA. The drug permeability characteristics studied under â€œonâ€“offâ€ stimuli suggested that there was faster drug permeation when electrical stimuli was â€˜onâ€™ and it decreased when electrical stimuli was â€˜off.â€™ The histopathology study confirmed the altered skin structural integrity after application of electrical stimuli. Hence, the PAAm-g-Dxt based ETDS are useful for transdermal drug delivery triggered by an electric stimulus to deliver on-demand release of drug into systemic circulation."

"Damage Estimation of a Concrete Pier When Exposed to Extreme Flood and Debris Loading Point Interpolation Method; Volumetric Locking; Finite Element Analysis The structural safety and serviceability during extreme weather, such as floods and storms, is critical. Due to global warming in the last decades, the increase in the intensity of natural disasters, i.e., flood loading and the durability of the road structures and infrastructures, is becoming critical. Bridges and structures lose their capacity because of ageing over time. On the other hand, the load intensity is another reason for the structural damage. Debris loading due to the flooding on bridges is one of the reasons for the increase in flood loading and eventually structural damage. Measuring the level of structural damage under extreme events is vital in determining the vulnerability and resilience of structures during a disaster. A damage index (DI) can be defined as a measurement tool for the levels of structural damage. Oftentimes, damage indices are developed to measure the deterioration of the system under earthquake loading. Little work has been published on damage indices (DIs) under flood loading, where a uniform pressure is applied to a structure. This paper presents a comprehensive review of DIs published in the literature and compares two approaches to assess the systemâ€™s damage utilising finite element methodologies. The structure model developed in the ABAQUS software package is used to predict the failure of a concrete component under applied lateral loading. The model is validated using published experimental work. The model is verified, and then it is used to compute the damage indicators using two primary techniques, including a deflection-based method and an energy loss-based approach. Using the two offered DIs, the change in damage levels is displayed underwater flow uniform loading. A comparison of the two methods is conducted. In this paper, differences between the two concepts are analysed and presented."
Mechanical response and dynamic deformation mechanisms of closed-cell aluminium alloy foams under dynamic loading Aluminum Foam; Hölder Space; Energy Absorption The dynamic compressive response of closed-cell (CYMATâ„¢) stabilised aluminium alloy foams (SAF) has been investigated using a modified Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) in conjunction with a high-speed camera. Tests have been carried out on 45 mm diameter and 23 mm thick cylindrical specimens. The elastic-plastic pore collapse mechanism has been investigated using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and micro-computed X-ray tomography. A stress-strain relationship for individual specimens at different impact velocities has been obtained with the combination of an analytical method and SHPB theory. The large deformation (âˆ¼80%) has been measured from eight strain gaugesâ€™ data using a wave separation algorithm. The test results exhibited a significant increase in elastic and plastic strength during the pulse loading. The X-ray tomography data of pre-impacted and post-impacted SAF specimens have been extensively analysed to elucidate the internal elastic-plastic pore collapse mechanisms.

"Chapter 11: Machine Learning and Scoring Functions (SFs) for Molecular Drug Discovery: Prediction and Characterisation of Druggable Drugs and Targets Chemoinformatics; Drug Discovery; Topographic Mapping Predicting druggability and prioritising disease-modifying targets is critical in drug discovery. In this chapter, we describe the testing of a druggability rule based on 9 molecular parameters, which uses cutpoints for each molecular parameter and targets based on mixture clustering discriminant analysis. We demonstrate that principal component constructs and score functions of violations can be used to identify the hidden pattern of druggable molecules and disease targets. Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network rules to classify the high-score target from the low-score molecular violators, based both on molecular parameters and the principal component constructs, have confirmed the value of logD's inclusion in the scoring function. Our scoring functions of counts of violations and novel principal component analytic molecular and target-based constructs partitioned chemospace well, identifying both good and poor druggable molecules and targets. Viable molecules and targets were located in both the beyond Rule of 5 and expanded Rule of 5 regions. Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks showed different variable importance profiles, with Artificial Neural Networks models performing better than Random Forests. The most important molecular descriptors that influence classification, by the Random Forest methods, were MW, NATOM, logD, and PSA. The optimal Artificial Neural Networks target models indicated that PSA and logD were more important than the traditional parameter MW. Overall, our score 4 partitions using logD were optimal at classification as shown in all Random Forests and Artificial Neural Networks analyses."

"Legitimacy theory: Despite its enduring popularity and contribution, time is right for a necessary makeover Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to reflect upon the contributions made to the social and environmental accounting literature by papers that comprised a 2002 Special Issue of Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal (AAAJ) entitled social and environmental reporting and its role in maintaining or creating organisational legitimacy. This paper will also provide insights into the origins of legitimacy theory as used in the social and environmental accounting literature as well as providing reflections about the strengths, and shortcomings, of the theory. Suggestions are made with respect to the ongoing application, and development, of legitimacy theory. Design/methodology/approach: As a commentary, this paper utilises a review of the social and environmental accounting and institutional literature across a number of decades to reveal insights about the development and use of legitimacy theory as a basis to explain social and environmental reporting practices. Citation data are also used to indicate the potential impact that the papers in the 2002 Special Issue had upon subsequent research. Findings: This commentary shows that the 2002 Special Issue is the most highly cited issue in the history of AAAJ. It also shows that individually, some of the papers in the Special Issue represent some of the most highly cited papers in the social and environmental accounting literature. The commentary provides arguments to suggest that the development of legitimacy theory is in need of further refinement, and suggests a way in which this refinement might take place. Research limitations/implications: This paper is largely based on the opinions of one researcher, and the evidence presented in the paper is selected on the basis that it is deemed sufficient to support the opinions being projected. The paper also relies on citation data as an indicator of â€œimpactâ€. The implication of the research is that it identifies a â€œway forwardâ€ for the development of theory applicable to the understanding of organisational social and environmental reporting practices. Originality/value: The study provides evidence to show that the 2002 Special Issue was significant within the context of AAAJ, and also within the context of the evolution of the social and environmental accounting literature. The description of the history of the development of legitimacy theory, and of the theoryâ€™s subsequent application, provides a solid impetus for future refinements to the theory."

"Life cycle performance of Cross Laminated Timber mid-rise residential buildings in Australia Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Engineering wood products have significant potential as a sustainable alternative for concrete and steel in construction. Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) can add value to conventional timber products due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, simple installation, aesthetic features and environmental benefits. Recent changes in the national construction code permit structural timber buildings with a height of up to 25m, which demonstrates the strong commitment of the construction industry to adopt more sustainable practices. This paper aims to compare life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (LCGHGE) and life cycle cost (LCC) of CLT and reinforced concrete (RC) in identical midrise residential buildings in three most populated cities in Australia. It has shown that the CLT building has 30 % less LCGHGE compared with the RC building over a life span of 50 years in Melbourne, and 34% and 29% reduction in LCGHCE in Sydney and Brisbane, respectively. The results from LCC analysis showed that CLT building is 1.3% lower than conventional RC in Melbourne, and 0.9% lower in Sydney and Brisbane. The initial and end of life phases reflected reductions in LCGHGE and LCC for the CLT building whilst the operation phase incurred higher values. The extended service life of buildings has a major impact on the operational phase while changes in the discount rate have strong effects on the lifecycle operational and maintenance costs. Overall the CLT building outperformed the RC building in terms of LCGHGE and LCC across three cities. However, further savings in the operational phase with energy efficient methodologies and reuse or recycling of timber products at the end of life of the building can reinforce CLT as a sustainable alternative to RC construction."
"Spending to save: What will it cost to halt Australia's extinction crisis? Endangered Species Act; Environmental Protection; Tympanuchus Pallidicinctus As with most governments worldwide, Australian governments list threatened species and proffer commitments to recovering them. Yet most of Australia's imperiled species continue to decline or go extinct and a contributing cause is inadequate investment in conservation management. However, this has been difficult to evaluate because the extent of funding committed to such recovery in Australia, like in many nations, is opaque. Here, by collating disparate published budget figures of Australian governments, we show that annual spending on targeted threatened species recovery is around U.S.$92m (AU$122m) which is around one tenth of that spent by the U.S. endangered species recovery program, and about 15% of what is needed to avoid extinctions and recover threatened species. Our approach to estimating funding needs for species recovery could be applied in any jurisdiction and could be scaled up to calculate what is needed to achieve international goals for ending the species extinction crisis."

"A data-driven analytical roadmap to a sustainable 2030 in South Korea based on optimal renewable microgrids Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems Combined technological, economic, sociological, and environmental (TESE) models can play a unique role in leveraging renewable energies and supporting sustainable development. Yet, a multi-aspect TESE model has never been used in Korea to adapt to climate change through sustainable energy policies. This comprehensive TESE study addresses several sustainability challenges in the Korean energy sector. First, demand electricity is predicted using four deep and stacked neural networks to develop a smart demand-based model. Second, optimal hybrid renewable microgrids (HRMGs) are simulated at 17 sites to evaluate five renewable energy sources in three scenarios. Third, hybrid assessment results are clustered using a K-means algorithm to generate hybrid renewable energy maps for South Korea. Fourth, the TESE model is analyzed with more than 13 variables using a cascading multi-criteria decision-making approach to prorate a budget and develop a prioritized roadmap for a sustainable 2030 in Korea. Fifth, a stochastic linear mathematical model is developed to propose a sustainable energy policy that considers the water-energy-carbon nexus. The results show that a convolutional neural network can efficiently predict sequential demand electricity (R2 = 98.79%), with respective biogas, solar, hydrostatic, wind, and hydrokinetic energy fractions of 45.7%, 34.5%, 14%, 5.78%, and 0.01% under optimal conditions in Korea. The present free market-based policies are recommended to be revised in favor of domestic production of renewable energy facilities if new jobs can be created for more than $7500 each, and the carbon penalty cost can be kept below $83/ton CO2-eq in Korea."
"The effect of post-pyrolysis treatment on waste biomass derived hydrochar Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Hydrochars are materials with a promising future, as their high carbon content and porosity renders them suitable for uses including peat substitutes, soil remediation and carbon adsorbent precursors. Combining hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis offers the prospect to provide advanced materials with a higher porosity and carbon content. This approach would mitigate drawbacks associated to hydrochars, including phytotoxicity. This research studied the influence of pyrolysis temperature and heating time on the resulting properties of chars made from hydrothermal carbonization of biomass wastes at 200 Â°C for 4 h and compared them to biochars that had not received any prior hydrothermal carbonization. Interestingly, hydrochar followed by pyrolysis was able to result in phytostimulation, while, when only pyrolysis was carried out, phytotoxicity was eliminated, but no phytostimulant effect was observed. In addition, the results indicated that the higher and longer the pyrolysis temperature (from 350 to 550 Â°C) and duration time (from 1 to 5 h), respectively, the more microporosity was generated, while phytotoxicity was reduced. In addition, aromaticity and thermal stability significantly increased with pyrolysis treatment. Consequently, hydrochars improve their properties and offer more potential for environmental applications after a pyrolysis post-treatment."

"Image-Based Sexual Abuse: Online Distribution Channels and Illicit Communities of Support Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica This article investigates the nature and scope of image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) material on 77 high-volume online websites. On the majority of these sites, users appeared to be motivated by sexual gratification and proving masculinity to a sexually deviant peer network, rather than revenge against the person depicted in the image. We argue that nonconsensual image exchanges are contextualized within ever-expanding digital environments, characterized by dislocation of time and space, overvisualization, and hypersexuality. We argue that IBSA is a vehicle for the construction, performativity, and negotiation of hypermasculinity and heteronormativity, within the bounds and structures of existing gendered power relations."
"'I didn't even know it was a thing': Australian young adults' experience of economic abuse Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Economics of Scale Economic abuse is a form of intimate partner violence that involves one partner controlling or restricting, exploiting or sabotaging the economic resources of the other partner. Little is known how economic abuse manifests in young people's relationships or how to prevent it. This study explored young adults' experiences of economic abuse and identified the factors associated with economic abuse in their relationships. Twenty-four young adults (18 women and 6 men) aged 18-29, were interviewed in-depth using both unstructured narrative and semi-structured interview questions. Thematic analysis was used to identify forms of economic abuse. Common experiences of economic abuse included: exploitation of financial and other resources, controlling access to money, damage to property and sabotage of employment and study. The contextual factors included lack of awareness of economic abuse, valuing love and relationships over money and fear of conflict and rejection. We argue that economic abuse prevention strategies should target young adults in their relationship formation stage and take into account the context of relationships and the issues young people face when venturing into cohabitation."

"Discursive constructions of consumer choice, performance measurement and the marketisation of disability services and aged care in Australia Social Support; Social Care; Direct Payments We show how policy discourses construct consumer choice, performance measurement and quality standards as key technologies in the marketisation of disability services and aged care in Australia. The emergence of performance outcome measurement and increased consumer access to these through diverse consumer facing and interactive platforms enables the state to â€œgovern at a distanceâ€ through the management and shaping of outcome indicators rather than delivery of services. The state does this by creating market competition and establishing outcomes which reflect the construction people using services as informed and rational consumers rather than citizens. This construction and operationalisation frame marketisation as a rational solution to broken systems, assume choice is unproblematic and ignore diverse capacities to access and use information, resource differentials and contextual variables such as market maturity and service availability. The benign marketisation of human services thus discriminates against those who are already marginalised and disadvantaged unless equity strategies are clearly in place."

"Exploring tripartite praxis for the REDD + forest climate change initiative through community based ecotourism Destination; Ecotourism; Destination Management Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is a United Nations programme initiated in 2008 with the aim of mitigating climate change through the preservation of the worldâ€™s existing forest stocks. One of the challenges in its successful implementation has been community involvement in its design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The purpose of this study is to assess what REDD + can learn from the experience of Community-Based Ecotourism (CBET), which operates under many of the same conditions. A critical review of the related literature using the Scopus database was undertaken using three search strings including â€œREDD+â€ (2,913 listings), â€œcommunity-based ecotourismâ€ (113 listings) and â€œREDD + and tourismâ€ (6 listings) to identify the variables and themes related to each. Despite the significant increase in the number of publications on REDD + since 2008, only one was specifically related to ecotourism. We argue that CBET understood as a form of social capital can function as an enabling platform for REDD+, in particular its implementation of international conservation policy by working with local communities/indigenous peoples and business stakeholders, referred to here as the â€œtripartite praxisâ€. We demonstrate how CBET can act as a basis from which to guide internationally driven incentive-based conservation policy and community entrepreneurship within a social capital framework."
"Electric Vehicle Profiling A significant transformation is expected in the electricity grid over the next decade with a large number of electric vehicles (EV) in Australia’s vehicle fleet.

"Microfinance financial sustainability and outreach: is there a trade-off? Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion The financial sustainability of microfinance institutions (MFIs) is crucial for the continual existence of the microfinance industry. As a result, emphasis has been placed on the financial sustainability of MFIs over the past few years. However, with the primary goal of the industry being the attainment of social outreach, the emphasis on financial sustainability has raised concerns about a potential adverse effect on outreach. Using data on 1595 MFIs in 109 countries, we examine if there is a trade-off between financial sustainability and outreach. The evidence shows that there is a trade-off between sustainability and outreach depth, but complementarity between sustainability and outreach breadth."
"Tailoring the effects of titanium dioxide (Tio2) and polyvinyl alcohol (pva) in the separation and antifouling performance of thin-film composite polyvinylidene fluoride (pvdf) membrane Polyethersulfone; Membrane; Ultrafiltration In this study, thin-film composite (TFC) polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes were synthesized by coating with titanium dioxide (TiO2 )/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution by a dip coating method and cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. Glutaraldehyde (GA) acted as a cross-linking agent to improve the thermal and chemical stability of the thin film coating. The incorporation of TiO2 in the film enhanced the hydrophilicity of the membrane and the rejection of dyes during filtration. The layer of TiO2 nanoparticles on the PVDF membranes have mitigated the fouling effects compared to the plain PVDF membrane. The photocatalytic performance was studied at different TiO2 loading for the photodegradation of dyes (reactive blue (RB) and methyl orange (MO)). The results indicated that the thin film coating of TiO2/PVA enhanced photocatalytic performance and showed good reusability under UV irradiation. This study showed that nearly 78% MO and 47% RB were removed using the TFC membrane. This work provides a new vision in the fabrication of TFC polymeric membranes as an efficient wastewater treatment tool."
"Cross-continental importance of CH4 emissions from dry inland-waters Dissolved Inorganic Carbon; Lakes; Methane Emission Despite substantial advances in quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from dry inland waters, existing estimates mainly consist of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, methane (CH4) may also be relevant due to its higher Global Warming Potential (GWP). We report CH4 emissions from dry inland water sediments to i) provide a cross-continental estimate of such emissions for different types of aquatic systems (i.e., lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and streams) and climate zones (i.e., tropical, continental, and temperate); and ii) determine the environmental factors that control these emissions. CH4 emissions from dry inland waters were consistently higher than emissions observed in adjacent uphill soils, across climate zones and in all aquatic systems except for streams. However, the CH4 contribution (normalized to CO2 equivalents; CO2-eq) to the total GHG emissions of dry inland waters was similar for all types of aquatic systems and varied from 10 to 21%. Although we discuss multiple controlling factors, dry inland water CH4 emissions were most strongly related to sediment organic matter content and moisture. Summing CO2 and CH4 emissions revealed a cross-continental average emission of 9.6 Â± 17.4 g CO2-eq mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1 from dry inland waters. We argue that increasing droughts likely expand the worldwide surface area of atmosphere-exposed aquatic sediments, thereby increasing global dry inland water CH4 emissions. Hence, CH4 cannot be ignored if we want to fully understand the carbon (C) cycle of dry sediments."
"Entrepreneurial Motivations, Opportunities, and Challenges: An International Perspective Entrepreneurial Intention; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship The current entrepreneurship research has primarily focused on external environmental factors that influence enterprise development in developed economies, whilst studies from developing economies are lagging. Yet, evidence from the World Bank and Global Entrepreneurship Index suggest that entrepreneurship practice in developing economies has peaked. Using semi-structured interview data from 20 entrepreneurs in The Gambia, we examined their motivations for entrepreneurship, the market opportunities and challenges hindering enterprise growth. We found the factors influencing motivation to be individual (necessity, poverty, job creation, personal knowledge, and experience) and contextual (opportunity recognition, ethnic and religious norms). Interestingly, three forms of opportunities were identified: entrepreneurial networks, competitive market, and discovery. Nonetheless, the entrepreneurs faced individual challengesâ€“insufficient finance and unskilled staffâ€“and contextual limitations such as political change, limited government reforms, high taxes, high business cost, and market uncertainty. We offer critical insights into individual and contextual motivations for entrepreneurship, extending the current discourse. In addition, we expose specific dynamic market influences for enterprise development in a developing economy."
"Policy, plans and pathways: The 'crisis' transition to post-parental care for people ageing with intellectual disabilities in rural Australian carescapes Autism; Children with Developmental Disabilities; Caregivers The concurrent ageing of parental care-givers and people with intellectual disabilities is driving academic and social welfare concern for a post-parental care 'crisis'. The 'crisis' typically pertains to a transition from primary care in the family home precipitated by the death or incapacity of older parents without a pre-planned pathway to post-parental care. This crisis is amplified in rural communities given low service engagement with families and a deficit of disability-supported accommodation and services. Academics, service providers and policy makers have responded through a problematisation of post-parental care planning. This focus continues to normalise informal care, burdens families with responsibility for planning, and diverts attention from structural deficits in the socio-political carescape. This paper attends to the Australian policy landscape in which long-term care-giving for families living with intellectual disability is enmeshed. It contends that the dyadic and didactic model of informal long-term care has profound implications for social service support and post-parental care planning. Problematisation of carers' 'need' to relinquish primary care and for people with intellectual disabilities to transition to independent and supported living is necessary to unsettle the dominant policy and service discourse around the provision of services to sustain informal care-giving. Innovation is then needed to forge pathways of support for families in rural communities planning on continuing, transitioning and transforming care arrangements across the lifespan."
"“Football is war” – FIFA's reactions to a real war and the response of football fans Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: The commentary examines the possible rational for Federation Internationale de Football Association(FIFA) sending a series of tweets on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Design/methodology/approach: The commentary counts and analyses the number of tweets sent by FIFA media between 1 February and 1 March, 2020 and indicates that these concerning the war in Ukraine represent a radical departure from past topics. Stakeholder engagements with the tweets on the war were recorded and these far surpassed other regular topics. Findings: FIFA's stance in condemning the war and taking direct action against Russia was effective in generating far greater stakeholder engagements in Twitter than other football-related posts. While the tweets were favourably received by many fans, not all of that response was positive, and in fact, some were extremely hostile. Originality/value: An analysis of tweets and their responses provides a relatively new and powerful mechanism for gauging stakeholder engagements. The authors also contribute to the literature on communication strategies of sporting bodies by demonstrating how the integration of social issues into social media posts is likely to exhibit a strong response, albeit not always favourable. When sporting bodies (such as FIFA) depart from their core mission, they risk alienating some stakeholders when they delve into controversial social and/or political issues."
"Digital communities at work: Singapore Poetry Writing Month Creative Writing Workshop; Cyclic AMP; Transformative Learning This article outlines the development of the Singapore Poetry Writing Month (SingPoWriMo) digital community, organised around an annual month-long poem-a-day, prompt-based writing challenge carried out on Facebook. As a highly active digital writing community, SingPoWriMo has generated more poetry in English in its six-year history than the Singapore literary community has since independence. The poems posted on SingPoWriMo are able to reach the groupâ€™s population of more than 7,000 members without the traditional filters to publication such as editorial input, publisher selection, economic choice and transaction, and critical review. Conversely, social media provides selective replacements for some of these functions, via comment threads, â€˜likesâ€™ and other reactions, as well as Facebookâ€™s viral sharing function that allows poetry to reach an audience beyond the group. These factors of mass reach, rapidity, immediacy, and instant feedback have implications for the poetry generated, which goes on to integrate and remake traditional modes of publication and performance according to the qualities of a digital community. This article seeks to examine the historical antecedents and influences of high-volume, high-speed poetic output; the nature of the poetry being written in these digital writing communities; and the effects and implications of the SingPoWriMo phenomenon on the Singaporean and regional literary ecosystems. SingPoWriMo and its counterparts are new ways of writing that also create, and demand, new ways of understanding writing."
"Rice-shrimp ecosystems in the Mekong Delta: Linking water quality, shrimp and their natural food sources Biofloc Technology; Penaeus Vannamei; Aquaculture Aquatic ecosystems are used for extensive rice-shrimp culture where the available water alternates seasonally between fresh and saline. Poor water quality has been implicated as a risk factor for shrimp survival; however, links between shrimp, water quality and their main food source, the natural aquatic biota inhabiting these ponds, are less well understood. We examined the aquatic biota and water quality of three ponds over an entire year in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, where the growing season for the marine shrimp Penaeus monodon has been extended into the wet season, when waters freshen. The survival (30â€“41%) and total areal biomass (350â€“531 kg haâˆ’1) of shrimp was constrained by poor water quality, with water temperatures, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentrations falling outside known optimal ranges for several weeks. Declines in dissolved oxygen concentration were matched by declines in both shrimp growth rates and lipid content, the latter being indicative of nutritional condition. Furthermore, as the dry season transitioned into the wet, shifts in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton were accompanied by declines in the biomass of benthic algae, an important basal food source in these systems. Densities of the benthic invertebrates directly consumed by shrimp also varied substantially throughout the year. Overall, our findings suggest that the survival, condition and growth of shrimp in extensive rice-shrimp ecosystems will be constrained when poor water quality and alternating high and low salinity negatively affect the physiology, growth and composition of the natural aquatic biota. Changes in management practices, such as restricting shrimp inhabiting ponds to the dry season, may help to address these issues and improve the sustainable productivity and overall condition of these important aquatic ecosystems."
"Factors influencing green building development in Kazakhstan Green Building; Construction Industry; Project Delivery Green buildings have been actively spreading as a solution for sustainability issues of the construction industry in at least the last two decades. As green building practices unfold in developing countries, the need of identifying factors that both hinder and drive its spread rises. Multiple studies reveal a general inconsistency among results in different parts of the world, caused by each countryâ€™s environmental, economic, and social conditions. Taking into account the experience of developing international green buildings and the current state of green building development in Kazakhstan, this study aims to spread the understanding of the factors that hinder and have the potential to drive the development of green buildings in Kazakhstan. A questionnaire survey was carried out among 38 industry experts in Kazakhstan to accomplish study objectives. Multiple data analysis methods were used to identify correlations among groups of experts and rank the factors. The results revealed a lack of skill/experience, a lack of government support, and the high cost of sustainable materials and products as the most crucial barriers. Water and energy efficiency, improved health of occupants, comfort, and satisfaction were identified as the most influential drivers. By expanding knowledge on factors affecting the implementation of green buildings, the study uncovered common trends in the responses of professionals, providing valuable information for field professionals and suggesting future research recommendations."

"Mitigating spatial conflict of land use for sustainable wetlands landscape in Li-Xia-river region of central Jiangsu, China Ecosystem Health; China; Ecological Civilisation Li-Xia-river Wetlands make up the biggest freshwater marsh in East China. Over the last decades, social and economic developments have dramatically altered the natural wetlands landscape. Mitigating land use conflict is beneficial to protect wetlands, maintain ecosystem services, and coordinate local socioeconomic development. This study employed multi-source data and GIS-based approaches to construct a composite index model with the purpose of quantitatively evaluating the intensity of land use conflict in Li-Xia-river Wetlands from 1978 to 2018. The results showed that the percentage of the wetlandsâ€™ area declined from 20.3% to 15.6%, with an overall reduction rate of 23.2%. The mean index of land use conflict increased from 0.15 to 0.35, which suggests that the conflict intensity changed from â€œno conflictâ€ to â€œmild conflict.â€ The number of severe conflict units increased by about 25 times. A conspicuous spatial variation of land use conflict was observed across different periods, although taking land for agricultural activities was the overriding reason for wetlands reduction. However, in recent years, urban sprawl has posed the greatest threat to Li-Xia-river Wetlands. Coordinating land use conflict and formulating a practical strategy are the initial imperative steps to mitigate the threat to wetlands."
"Effect of Star Rating Improvement of Residential Buildings on Life Cycle Environmental Impacts and Costs Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building A diagnostic framework is proposed to assess the influence of star rating improvement for residential buildings on life cycle environmental impacts and life cycle costs (LCEI and LCC) using life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing methods, respectively, on all life cycle phases (i.e., construction, operation, maintenance, and disposal). A reference house was modified on the basis of six alternative designs to deliver a particular star rating in order to demonstrate the analysis framework. Two LCIA methods (i.e., material flows/add masses and eco-indicator 99 Australian substances) were used to estimate ten LCEI indicators under two categories: seven from problem-oriented (i.e., raw material, air emission, water emission, eco-toxicity, acidification/eutrophication potential, ozone depletion, and climate change) and three from damage-oriented (i.e., resource depletion, ecosystem quality, and effect on human health) categories. The three damage-oriented indicators were combined to evaluate environmental and economic wellbeing on a single eco-point basis. All these combinations of impact indicators can offer three lines of analytical options along with star rating: problem-oriented, damage-oriented, and a variety of problem and damage-oriented LCEIs with LCCs. Hence, the optimum house selection is-based not only on cost or star rating, but also on LCEIs."
"Bearing worlds: learning to live-with climate change Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Climate Change; Skepticism This paper explores the emotional experiences of some undergraduate sustainability students in a semester long course on climate change. Specifically, it attends to experiences of anxiety, frustration, overwhelm, guilt, grief and hope. I suggest these experiences are characteristic of a process I term learning to live-with climate change. Learning to live-with climate change involves attuning to the relational composition of the world and thus the self; mourning desirable relationships that are lost as the planet warms; and responding to these conditions in ways that may foster more liveable worlds. Collectively, these processes enrol people in practices of bearing worlds: enduring the pain of the end of the world they have known, and labouring to generate promising alternatives. As such, these processes reconfigure the self and its relations, and attunement to how climate change composes, recomposes and decomposes particular subjectivities is important. The paper argues that affective adaptation is therefore a crucial element of climate change education."

Our study will elucidate the mechanisms underlying the establishment of HAND during suppressive antiretroviral therapy."
"Energy poverty and health: Panel data evidence from Australia Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Australia's diverse climate makes it vulnerable to cold winters and extremely warm summers, characterised by severe bushfires and heat waves. Thus, unlike most European countries, energy poverty in Australia is linked with difficulty both maintaining adequate warmth during winter and ensuring adequate cooling during summer. Energy poverty in Australia is, therefore, associated with cold-and-heat-related health issues. We draw on 13 waves of representative panel data for the Australian adult population to examine the relationship between energy poverty and self-assessed health. We use both objective and subjective indicators of energy poverty. We instrument for energy poverty using energy prices. When we instrument for energy poverty, we find that a standard deviation increase in energy poverty is associated with a decline in general health between 0.099 and 0.296 standard deviations. The finding that energy poverty lowers health is robust to different ways of measuring health and alternative methods to addressing endogeneity of energy poverty, including using internal instruments, dynamic panel methods and propensity score matching."

"Risk management in border inspection Tax Compliance; Taxation; Income As part of their commitments under the WTO's Agreement on Trade Facilitation, many developing countries will adopt risk management, a strategy for selecting import shipments for inspection. In this paper we formalize key enforcement issues related to risk management. We argue that the complexities of international trade oversight mean that inspecting agencies lack certainty about the conditional probability that a given shipment will comply with import regulations. Ambiguity of this sort is likely to be important in developing countries that lack the sophisticated information technology (IT) used in advanced risk management. We show empirically that infrequent shipments have conditionally higher inspection rates, a finding that is consistent with our ambiguity hypothesis. We formalize a role for ambiguity in a theoretical model of border inspection. We calibrate the model and shock the ambiguity parameters to illustrate the consequences of an IT-driven improvement in risk management capabilities for search and compliance."

"The toxicity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to three freshwater invertebrates with different life strategies: Hydra vulgaris, Daphnia carinata, and Paratya australiensis Nanocrystal; Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticle; Ecotoxicity The toxicity of manufactured nanoparticles varies greatly depending on the test species in consideration and estimates of toxicity may also be confounded by test media in which the organisms are cultured. For a more comprehensive toxicity evaluation, species at different trophic levels or with life strategies, tested in different media should be included. In this study, we examined the toxicity of tyrosine-coated silver nanonparticles (tyr-AgNP) to three Australian freshwater invertebrates: Hydra vulgaris, Daphnia carinata, and Paratya australiensis. Tyr-AgNPs were synthesized, characterized and their behavior was examined in different media used for acute toxicity tests. Additionally, the sensitivity of tested organisms to tyr-AgNPs was compared to ionic silver (Ag+). Based on the LC50 values of both tyr-AgNPs and Ag+ions at different time points, D. carinata was found to be the most sensitive species followed by P. australiensis and H. vulgaris. NP stability studies revealed that tyr-AgNPs were least stable in hydra medium followed by daphnid and shrimp media. This study demonstrates that significant differences in NP toxicity to aquatic organisms exist and the test media and the life strategy of the species play a key role in these differences. Therefore, it is recommended that a multispecies approach is used in predictive risk assessment of NPs and to ensure protection of native species from possible toxic effects from NPs released into aquatic systems. Also recommended is to carefully investigate the fate and behavior of NPs in different media in assessing NP toxicity and emphasize the need to use native species in developing relevant regulatory frameworks."

"‘So, What is a Good Masculinity?’: Navigating Normativity in Violence Prevention with Men and Boys Young; Sex Education; Sexuality Engaging men and boys to address the links between masculinity and gendered violence is a rapidly expanding space for primary prevention, in Australia and globally. There are parallel debates within feminist commentary on violence prevention and in masculinity studies over how to conceptualise and deconstruct masculinity for the long-term transformation of gender inequality. This article analyses semi-structured interviews with Australian prevention practitioners whose work focuses on engaging men and boys, which included initiatives aimed at gender equality, healthy masculinity, preventing violence against women, and domestic/family violence prevention. Interviews highlighted that these practitioners are currently grappling with how to address masculinity as a construct and/or a normative process within their work to achieve gender transformative change. These tensions reflect ongoing concerns over reproducing narrow associations between men and masculinity that perpetuate essentialised identity categories. Importantly, I question whether a focus on â€˜positiveâ€™ or â€˜healthyâ€™ masculinities can effectively go beyond the binary gender relations that underpin gendered violence. The research findings suggest a need for greater reflexive and creative thinking around how men and masculinity are (de)centred within violence prevention to better support gender transformation."

"Evaluating the performance of e-government in Indonesia: A thematic analysis Open Government; Transparency; E-Governance This paper evaluates the performance of e-government from the viewpoint of citizens in Indonesia. Six critical perspectives including availability, efficiency, information security, information quality, service functionality and transparency are adopted for investigating the performance of e-government in Indonesia. The study reveals that the overall performance of e-government in Indonesia is unsatisfactory. Such unsatisfactory performance is mainly due to the low-level of availability, the substandard quality of information, the unreliability of e-government services, and the vulnerability on the information security. From the practical perspective, this research provides the Indonesian government and public organizations with relevant suggestions on how the performance of e-government can be improved. Such suggestions can lead to the formulation of better strategies and policies for the continuous development of e-government in Indonesia."
"Advances in transcriptomics of plants Argonaute Proteins; Gene; Nicotiana Benthamiana The current global population of 7.3 billion is estimated to reach 9.7 billion in the year 2050. Rapid population growth is driving up global food demand. Additionally, global climate change, environmental degradation, drought, emerging diseases, and salty soils are the current threats to global food security. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of these diverse agricultural productivity constraints and enhance crop yield and stress-tolerance in plants, we need to go beyond traditional and molecular plant breeding. The powerful new tools for genome editing, Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) and Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas systems (CRISPR-Cas9), have been hailed as a quantum leap forward in the development of stress-resistant plants. Plant breeding techniques, however, have several drawbacks. Hence, identification of transcriptional regulatory elements and deciphering mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation are crucial to avoiding unintended consequences in modified crop plants, which could ultimately have negative impacts on human health. RNA splicing as an essential regulated post-transcriptional process, alternative polyadenylation as an RNA-processing mechanism, along with non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, small interfering RNAs and long non-coding RNAs) have been identified as major players in gene regulation. In this chapter, we highlight new findings on the essential roles of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation in plant development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. We also discuss biogenesis and the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants and recent advances in our knowledge of the roles of miRNAs and siRNAs in plant stress response."
"How do development actors do “ICT for development”? A strategy-as-practice perspective on emerging practices in Ghanaian agriculture Cell Phone Use; Market Information; Agriculture This paper examines how development actors within the Ghanaian agricultural sector enact information and communication technology (ICT) in their day-to-day outreach practices with smallholder farmers. We draw on an in-depth qualitative case study, informed by the theoretical perspective of â€œstrategy-as-practiceâ€ to answer the research question: â€œwhat ICT-mediated strategic practices are used by development actors in the Ghanaian agriculture sector?â€ The research findings reveal that (1) the activities of development actors are meshed within a network of interdependencies; (2) the enacted strategic practices reflect the trade-off between novelty of content and novelty of the technologies used to deliver it; and lastly, (3) the praxis of development actors for doing ICT for development consists of hybrid strategies, combining bottom-up approaches consistent with farmers' indigenous smallholder logic, with top-down imperatives framing agriculture â€œas a businessâ€ and nurturing value-chain integration. Consequently, our research points to the impact of ICT initiatives as step-wise and attained over the long term, rather than disruptive and attained in the immediate term."
"Midkine treatment for multi-organ protection from hypoxia and inflammation in neonates (PG08917) The GOAL of this program is to develop a safe and easily administered therapy for infants that have experienced oxygen and nutrient starvation during gestation and at birth. We propose that treatment with the growth factor MIDKINE has the potential to address
complications of birth asphyxia, principally neonatal encephalopathy (NE) and associated multi-organ dysfunction involving respiratory, cardiovascular, renal and digestive systems. In this project, we will determine the most effective and clinically relevant way to deliver
midkine to neonatal animals (systemic vs intranasal routes), and investigate if midkine treatment at various times after birth improves the health of infants that would otherwise suffer multi-organ damage and cerebral palsy. The results of this study will be readily transferable to a clinical trial of midkine in infants - in both high-income settings where therapeutic hypothermia is available, and in low resource settings where such interventions are not available!

"The role of product innovation on export behavior of firms: Is it innovation input or innovation output that matters? Foreign Direct Investment; Economic Growth; Learning by Exporting Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the role of innovation on the export behavior of firms. Design/methodology/approach: Using two waves of Swedish Community Innovation Survey merged with register data on firm-level, the authors estimate the influence of the innovation output and innovation input of firms on their export propensity and intensity. Findings: The authors find that the innovation output of firms (measured as sales due to innovative products) has a positive and significant effect on their subsequent export behavior, particularly on export intensity. The results also show that there is no direct effect of innovation input (innovative efforts) on export behavior. Originality/value: This is one of the first paper that clearly distinguishes between input and output parts of innovation process and empirically investigate their differentiated impact on export behavior of a representative sample of firms in an entire economy."

"Energy-related deprivation and housing tenure transitions Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Energy poverty is becoming an increasingly important policy consideration in many countries. We empirically examine the relationship between energy poverty and housing tenure in Australia using HILDA survey data over the period 2005 to 2018. We employ objective, subjective and composite measures of energy poverty and control for other respondent and household covariates. Results from our study, which are robust to a suite of checks, suggest that being energy poor has a negative impact on homeownership and â€œrent to ownâ€ transition, and a positive impact on â€œown to rentâ€ transition. We conclude by discussing the policy implications of our study."

"A method for validating the structural completeness of understory vegetation models captured with 3D remote sensing Lidar; Tree and Stand Measurements; Forest Inventory Characteristics describing below canopy vegetation are important for a range of forest ecosystem applications including wildlife habitat, fuel hazard and fire behaviour modelling, understanding forest recovery after disturbance and competition dynamics. Such applications all rely on accurate measures of vegetation structure. Inherent in this is the assumption or ability to demonstrate measurement accuracy. 3D point clouds are being increasingly used to describe vegetated environments, however limited research has been conducted to validate the information content of terrestrial point clouds of understory vegetation. This paper describes the design and use of a field frame to co-register point intercept measurements with point cloud data to act as a validation source. Validation results show high correlation of point matching in forests with understory vegetation elements with large mass and/or surface area, typically consisting of broad leaves, twigs and bark 0.02 m diameter or greater in size (SfM, MCC 0.51-0.66; TLS, MCC 0.37-0.47). In contrast, complex environments with understory vegetation elements with low mass and low surface area showed lower correlations between validation measurements and point clouds (SfM, MCC 0.40 and 0.42; TLS, MCC 0.25 and 0.16). The results of this study demonstrate that the validation frame provides a suitable method for comparing the relative performance of different point cloud generation processes."

This outcome contributes to current literature of arbitrage opportunities in emerging markets. Furthermore, as a practical contribution, the investors in ETF investment will significantly benefit as this paper suggests a pattern of VNMVN30 ETF in a day and estimates transaction costs related to arbitrage strategies of E1 VFN30."
"Predicting Mobility as a Service (MaaS) use for different trip categories: An artificial neural network analysis Car Sharing; Bike; Autonomous Vehicles Mobility as a Service (MaaS) has gained popularity as a means of sustainable urban transport which makes the understanding of MaaS use critical for its design and promotion. Studies have contributed to the growing understanding of MaaS, its design features, and consumersâ€™ willingness to pay for MaaS in general, without recourse to the differences in traveling for work, social and general purposes. This paper develops and tests models to predict MaaS use by applying artificial neural network analysis, following the cross industry standard process and data mining framework. It also estimates separate models for social, general, and work trips, using 33 input variables reflecting network externality, transaction cost, behaviour, institutional, environmental concern, personal travel, and socio-economic factors. Data are collected from a survey of 331 Australians. The study reveals different sets of socio-economic factors, the impact of Covid-19, and personal travel factors as key predictors of MaaS use for general, social, and work trips with an average prediction accuracy of 68%, 68%, and 75% respectively. The findings can be used to inform strategies and policies on how to attract a user base with respect to socio-economic and personal travel factors for promoting MaaS use."
"Active and passive electro-optical sensors for health assessment in food crops Stripe Rust; Plant Leaves; Puccinia Striiformis In agriculture, early detection of plant stresses is advantageous in preventing crop yield losses. Remote sensors are increasingly being utilized for crop health monitoring, offering non-de-structive, spatialized detection and the quantification of plant diseases at various levels of measure-ment. Advances in sensor technologies have promoted the development of novel techniques for precision agriculture. As in situ techniques are surpassed by multispectral imaging, refinement of hyperspectral imaging and the promising emergence of light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote sensing will define the future of biotic and abiotic plant stress detection, crop yield estimation and product quality. The added value of LIDAR-based systems stems from their greater flexibility in capturing data, high rate of data delivery and suitability for a high level of automation while overcoming the shortcomings of passive systems limited by atmospheric conditions, changes in light, viewing angle and canopy structure. In particular, a multi-sensor systems approach and associated data fusion techniques (i.e., blending LIDAR with existing electro-optical sensors) offer increased accuracy in plant disease detection by focusing on traditional optimal estimation and the adoption of artificial intelligence techniques for spatially and temporally distributed big data. When applied across different platforms (handheld, ground-based, airborne, ground/aerial robotic vehicles or satellites), these electro-optical sensors offer new avenues to predict and react to plant stress and disease. This review examines the key sensor characteristics, platform integration options and data analysis techniques recently proposed in the field of precision agriculture and highlights the key challenges and benefits of each concept towards informing future research in this very important and rapidly growing field."
"DIY Entrepreneurship? – Self-reliance for Women Refugees in Australia Migrant Workers; Self-Employment; Ethnic Business In this paper, we call for a re-examination of the self-reliance ideology based on a neoliberal perspective to make policies for refugee women's (self-)employment and integration. We use a social constructionist perspective to conduct a narrative analysis of data from the lived experience of twelve women refugee entrepreneurs. Three prominent themes emerge from the womenâ€™s own narratives of their entrepreneurial journey â€“ self-reconstruction, social capital, and resilience. Our findings reveal the complexities of self-reconstruction and socialization as experienced by refugee women entrepreneurs â€“ for whom â€œpushâ€ factors take precedence over â€œpullâ€ factors with the explicit understanding that the onus is on them to survive with their own resilience. We argue that offering people hope of a new life means offering them meaningful choices, built on forms of economic activity whose sustainability over the long term is evidenced by the positive supports available to make sure economic activity succeeds."
"The Green School Award in Hong Kong: Development and Impact in the School Sector School Health Services; Well-Being; Health Promotion The Hong Kong Green School Award (HKGSA) is a school award scheme hosted by the Environmental Campaign Committee (ECC) to encourage schools to promote environmental awareness and for students to develop an environmentally-friendly lifestyle. Since its inception in 2000, the HKGSA has undergone several phases of development. Between 2000 to 2008 it took the form of a competition with 3 winning schools and 10 merit schools After an initial review in 2005, it was decided to change the 8th HKGSA from a competition format to a benchmarking process. The successfully accredited schools were given the title of Green School once they fulfilled certain requirements. Another major reform took place in the 12th HKGSA in 2013 to allow flexibility for schools to satisfy the requirements in phases by completing the accreditation to attain the gold award over a period of 3 years, the introduction of facilitators to act as mentors and the enforcing of a maximum validity period for the accreditation. This structure mirrored the sustainable schools program in Victoria, Australia. HKGSA has become a well-received accreditation scheme which can also act as a driving force to promote education for sustainable development in the school sector which in 2020 will be subsumed under the Hong Kong Awards for Environmental Excellence (HKAEE). This chapter describes the development of this initiative in Hong Kong, its framework, implementation, impact and future."
"Revealing the mechanisms for potassium ferrate affecting methane production from anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge Activated Sludge; Anaerobic Digestion; Pretreatment This study investigated the issue of potassium ferrate (PF) affecting anaerobic methane generation from sludge by a set of experimental and model analyses. Experimental results indicated that the methane production was significantly promoted from 164.7 to 204.1 mL/g VSS (volatile suspended solids) with PF dosage enhanced from 0 to 0.05 g/g TSS (total suspended solids). Further enhancement of PF dosage reduced methane production, which even decreased to 135.4 mL/g VSS when PF dosage increased to 0.1 g/g TSS. Model-based analysis showed that except for methane production potential, the methane production rate was also promoted by PF treatment, which was sufficiently enhanced from 8.80 to 11.88 mL/g VSS/d when PF dosage was 0.05 g/g TSS. Mechanism studies indicated that PF not only promoted sludge disintegration, but also enhanced the proportion of biodegradable organics in sludge liquor, and the digestion potential of the non-biodegradable humus and lignocellulose were promoted."
"Women must be equal partners in science: Gender-balance lessons from biology Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science Access to scientific careers for women has never been easy, but as biases and barriers slowly begin to diminish, women are becoming more and more involved in science, especially Biological Sciences. Some of the reasons why women do not have the same opportunities to achieve career pathways equal to those of men are discussed. We conclude that there is an ongoing need to design and apply new policies to effect a gender balance throughout the career path. This is seen not simply as an equitable outcome - it is a moral imperative."
"Realising the potential of remote art centres to support older Aboriginal people and people living with dementia within the context of Consumer Directed Care (student: Paulene Mackell) The results of the overarching study will provide the government with a dynamic model which can be translated across remote settings where Aboriginal people aged over 55 years comprise around 30% of the artist population.  This model could lead to the earlier detection of dementia which in turn could lead to prevention..

The PhD will create a new body of evidence on the applicability of the recently introduced consumer directed model of care in remote communities and will inform government policy in this setting."
"Prediction of Field-Scale Wheat Yield Using Machine Learning Method and Multi-Spectral UAV Data Crops; Leaf Area Index; Hyperspectral Data Accurate prediction of food crop yield is of great significance for global food security and regional trade stability. Since remote sensing data collected from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms have the features of flexibility and high resolution, these data can be used as samples to develop regional regression models for accurate prediction of crop yield at a field scale. The primary objective of this study was to construct regional prediction models for winter wheat yield based on multi-spectral UAV data and machine learning methods. Six machine learning methods including Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) were used for the construction of the yield prediction models. Ten vegetation indices (VIs) extracted from canopy spectral images of winter wheat acquired from a multi-spectral UAV at five key growth stages in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, China in 2021 were selected as the variables of the models. In addition, in situ measurements of wheat yield were obtained in a destructive sampling manner for prediction algorithm modeling and validation. Prediction results of single growth stages showed that the optimal model was GPR constructed from extremely strong correlated VIs (ESCVIs) at the filling stage (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 49.22 g/m2, MAE = 42.74 g/m2). The results of multiple stages showed GPR achieved the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 49.18 g/m2, MAE = 42.57 g/m2) when the ESCVIs of the flowering and filling stages were used. Larger sampling plots were adopted to verify the accuracy of yield prediction; the results indicated that the GPR model has strong adaptability at different scales. These findings suggest that using machine learning methods and multi-spectral UAV data can accurately predict crop yield at the field scale and deliver a valuable application reference for farm-scale field crop management."
"Untreated rice husk ash incorporated high strength self-compacting concrete: Properties and environmental impact assessments Cement; Rice Hulls; Mortar The suitability of untreated rice husk ash (URHA) as a supplementary to the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and fine aggregates (FA) in high strength self-compacting concrete (SCC) was investigated in terms of mechanical properties as well as environmental impact assessments (EIA). In total, nine SCC mixes were prepared and investigated with various levels of URHA replacements to OPC and FA. Initially, the fresh and hardened properties of URHA incorporated SCC were determined. Further, EIAs were carried out considering eighteen different environmental impact indices for the optimum URHA incorporated SCC mixes to determine the most appropriate mix in terms of mechanical properties along with their environmental impacts. The experimental results reveal, URHA in the range of 10â€“15% can be used without compromising the fresh and hardened properties of SCC. The results of the EIAs are presented and discussed in terms of compressive strength to environmental indices ratios to normalise the comparison. The EIAs disclose that even through some of the mixes provide better performance in terms of certain environmental impact categories; especially CO2 emission, water pollution (fresh and marine) and ecotoxicity, their strength to environmental impact ratios are relatively low. Thus, it is recommended to select the optimum mix design of URHA incorporated high strength SCC in terms of mechanical properties and as well as EIA."
"Processes and institutions for scientific independence: Reflections on land & water Australia Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Independent and impartial scientific research provides critical contributions to many contemporary policy debates, including those about climate adaptation and natural resources. Therefore, institutional arrangements that enable and protect scientific independence are central to resolving environ mental problems in advanced liberal democracies. This paper provides an overview of the research and development (R&D) funding organisation Land & Water Australia (LWA) that, due to its statutory independence, was effective and influential in promoting sustainable natural resource management. Established by legislation that provided structural independence, LWA was insulated from direct interference, enabling it to operate at armâ€™s length from executive government. The paper profiles LWA contributions to changing policies and practices, and explores the features that enabled LWA to co ordinate, organise and fund R&D, until its abolition in 2009. LWA provided a useful precedent of a statutory authority, chartered with a clear legislated purpose and legal mechanisms for ensuring independence. The paper highlights institutional arrangements that protect scientific independence, arguing that LWA provided an important model of public R&D investment directed to sustainability transformations."
"The effect of smoke derivatives and carbon utilisation on symbiotic germination of the endangered pterostylis despectans (Orchidaceae) Germination; Tulasnella; Cephalanthera Orchids are highly dependent on exogenous nutritional sources and mycorrhizal associations to survive, particularly when challenged by extreme environmental stress such as bushfires that contribute significantly to its decline in nature. In this study, the effect of smoke derivatives and carbon utilisation was explored to improve germination and seedling establishment of an Australian endangered orchid, Pterostylis despectans (Lowly Greenhood) and its mycorrhizal fungi. Stored seeds were germinated in vitro with peloton-isolated fungal isolates with varying concentrations of smoke water (0-1.0 mL L-1) to simulate fire and sucrose as the carbon source (10 g L-1). Smoke water significantly increased germination, with advanced protocorms and robust seedlings produced. Sucrose inhibited germination such that protocorms and leafing was absent with sucrose inclusion. Fungal isolates were highly variable on its germination efficacy and tolerance to smoke water, highlighting the importance of fungal diversity and supports research-based conservation strategies to circumvent environmental challenges."
"Risk Identification, Assessment, and Allocation in PPP Projects: A Systematic Review China; Build-Operate-Transfer; Risk Allocations Public private partnerships (PPPs) have gained widespread adoption as an innovative way of procuring public infrastructure projects over the last two decades. Risk identification, assessment, and allocation have received considerable attention from researchers due to the risk heavy nature of PPP projects. Adoption of PPPs has triggered a sudden increase in research interest in the area in recent years. This study attempts to provide an updated systematic review of literature related to risks in PPPs using a PRISMA flowchart. The results of the study offer some valuable insights into the future and current state of research. The study found that the focus of research on PPPs has shifted from an overall risk identification and assessment approach to individual risk analysis. Moreover, this research trend is on the rise in developing countries, and that quantitative methods for risk management in PPP research and qualitative methods in practice are preferred. In developed economies, due to negative public sentiments, transparency concerns, and arguments of value for money not being achieved, PPPs are becoming less popular. For these reasons a shift to availability-based payment mechanisms such as in Design-Build-Finance-Maintain (DBFM) from traditional revenue-based mechanisms as in Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) has been observed. These shifts in research trends and practice offer researchers future opportunities to investigate these relatively newer approaches."
"Innovative technologies for producing and preserving intermediate moisture foods: A review Osmosis; Brix; Dehydration Intermediate moisture foods (IMF) or semi-dried foods (SDF) have gained more attention worldwide having features very similar to fresh food products, but with a longer shelf life. This review presents the recent developments in novel technologies and methods for the production and preservation of IMF. These include new drying methods, using agents to reduce water-activity, innovative osmotic dehydration technologies, electro-osmotic dewatering, thermal pasteurization, plasma treatments (PT), high pressure processing (HPP), modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), edible coating, active packaging (and energy efficiency, improve quality and extend the shelf life of the final food AP) and hurdle technologies (HT). Innovative methods applied to producing and preserving IMF can enhance both drying products. Yet more systematic research is still needed to bridge knowledge gaps, in particular on inactivation kinetics and mechanisms related to thermal and non-thermal pasteurization technologies for control of pathogens and spoilage micro-organisms in IMF."

"Special WSMC edition paper: What is this thing called money? Economic abuse in young adult relationships Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Economics of Scale Purpose: This paper aims to investigate how economic abuse manifests in young adult relationships from the perspective of practice experts to inform the role of social marketing in economic abuse prevention. Practitioners were asked for their views on prevention strategies at the individual, relationship, community and societal levels. Design methodology/approach: Twenty-four experts were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Findings: Experts reported that young adults experienced economic exploitation, adverse economic entanglement and economic control. Young adultsâ€™ frame of reference was a challenge for practitioners. Experts believed that more work needed to be done to improve the financial literacy of young adults. Research limitations/implications: Practitioner views provide one side of the story. A separate study has been established interviewing young adults to explore these issues further. Practical implications: The authors argue that prevention and intervention strategies need to focus on young adults who are in their critical relationship formation stage. The identified attitudinal factors present a challenge to policy, prevention and service providers. Originality/value: The authors shift the attention from service engaged women leaving violent relationships to young adults who have not sought assistance from community or domestic violence services. In doing so, they highlight the importance of the relationship formation phase. This paper raises the challenge for social marketers to consider appropriate prevention and intervention programmes for this cohort. Current and future campaigns and programmes need to be designed and evaluated with an economic abuse lens."

"Comparative root transcriptomics provide insights into drought adaptation strategies in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) Cicer; Ascochyta; Genetic Variability Drought adversely affects crop production across the globe. The root system immensely contributes to water management and the adaptability of plants to drought stress. In this study, drought-induced phenotypic and transcriptomic responses of two contrasting chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) genotypes were compared at the vegetative, reproductive transition, and reproductive stages. At the vegetative stage, drought-tolerant genotype maintained higher root biomass, length, and surface area under drought stress as compared to sensitive genotype. However, at the reproductive stage, root length and surface area of tolerant genotype was lower but displayed higher root diameter than sensitive genotype. The shoot biomass of tolerant genotype was overall higher than the sensitive genotype under drought stress. RNA-seq analysis identified genotype-and developmental-stage specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to drought stress. At the vegetative stage, a total of 2161 and 1873 DEGs, and at reproductive stage 4109 and 3772 DEGs, were identified in the tolerant and sensitive genotypes, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed enrichment of biological categories related to cellular process, metabolic process, response to stimulus, response to abiotic stress, and response to hormones. Interestingly, the expression of stress-responsive transcription factors, kinases, ROS signaling and scavenging, transporters, root nodulation, and oxylipin biosynthesis genes were robustly upregulated in the tolerant genotype, possibly contributing to drought adaptation. Furthermore, activation/repression of hormone signaling and biosynthesis genes was observed. Overall, this study sheds new insights on drought tolerance mechanisms operating in roots with broader implications for chickpea improvement."
"Online and social media resilience in young people in vulnerable contexts Cyberbullying; Crime Victims; Workplace Bullying This Australian study explored the resilience to online abusive activity and enticements to violence amongst a cohort of young people in vulnerable contexts. The vulnerable contexts were defined as those where family disruption, domestic violence and subsequent geographical dislocation were present in the young personâ€™s environment. The young people, aged 12 to 19 years, were interviewed to elicit the prevalence of abusive or violent online and social media behaviours and were invited to discuss the resilience strategies they used to deal with such behaviours. Whilst resilience to online abusive activity has been studied in some depth, the prevalence of such activity and its effect upon young people in domestic violence or other abusive contexts has not. This study which examined the first-hand responses of a small number of young people in domestic violence contexts, found that the resilience strategies were dependent upon the maturity of the individual, the perceived support mechanisms available to the young person, the peer group attitude and the emotional attachment to the peer group. The results broadly match resilience strategies evident in the existing literature but add new knowledge about the significance of the maturation process and its effect upon resilience strategies for vulnerable youth. The study provides new insights into the development of resilience in online or social media contexts for young people in vulnerable contexts."
"Marine Protists and Rhodotorula Yeast as Bio-Convertors of Marine Waste into Nutrient-Rich Deposits for Mangrove Ecosystems Schizochytrium; Labyrinthulida; Docosahexaenoic Acid This paper represents a comprehensive study of two new thraustochytrids and a marine Rhodotorula red yeast isolated from Australian coastal waters for their abilities to be a potential renewable feedstock for the nutraceutical, food, fishery and bioenergy industries. Mixotrophic growth of these species was assessed in the presence of different carbon sources: glycerol, glucose, fructose, galactose, xylose, and sucrose, starch, cellulose, malt extract, and potato peels. Up to 14 g DW/L (4.6 gDW/L-day and 2.8 gDW/L-day) of biomass were produced by Aurantiochytrium and Thraustochytrium species, respectively. Thraustochytrids biomass contained up to 33% DW of lipids, rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6, 124 mg/g DW); up to 10.2 mg/gDW of squalene and up to 61 Î¼g/gDW of total carotenoids, composed of astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, echinenone, and Î²-carotene. Along with the accumulation of these added-value chemicals in biomass, thraustochytrid representatives showed the ability to secrete extracellular polysaccharide matrixes containing lipids and proteins. Rhodotorula sp lipids (26% DW) were enriched in palmitic acid (C16:0, 18 mg/gDW) and oleic acid (C18:1, 41 mg/gDW). Carotenoids (87 Î¼g/gDW) were mainly represented by Î²-carotene (up to 54 Î¼g/gDW). Efficient growth on organic and inorganic sources of carbon and nitrogen from natural and anthropogenic wastewater pollutants along with intracellular and extracellular production of valuable nutrients makes the production of valuable chemicals from isolated species economical and sustainable."

"Waste-derived low-cost mycelium composite construction materials with improved fire safety Mechanical Properties; Plywood; Fagus Sylvatica Subsp. Orientalis Mycelial growth attracts academic and commercial interest because of its ability to upcycle agricultural and industrial wastes into economical and environmentally sustainable composite materials using a natural, low-energy manufacturing process able to sequester carbon. This study aims to characterise the effect of varying ratios of high silica agricultural and industrial wastes on the flammability of mycelium composites, relative to typical synthetic construction materials. The results reveal that mycelium composites are safer than the traditional construction materials considered, producing much lower average and peak heat release rates and longer time to flashover. They also release significantly less smoke and CO2, although CO production fluctuated. Rice hulls yielded significant char and silica ash which improved fire performance, but composites containing glass fines exhibited the best fire performance because of their significantly higher silica concentrations and low combustible material content. Higher concentrations of glass fines increased volume-specific cost but reduced mass-specific and density-specific costs. The findings of this study show that mycelium composites are a very economical alternative to highly flammable petroleum-derived and natural gas-derived synthetic polymers and engineered woods for applications including insulation, furniture, and panelling."
"Fog Harvesting with Highly Wetting and Nonwetting Vertical Strips Hydrophobicity; Wetting Transition; Fabrication Highly wetting and nonwetting substrates have been widely used in fogwater collection systems for enhanced water harvesting. In this work, fog harvesting substrates comprising PVC strips of different wetting properties and widths ranging from 1-5 mm were vertically aligned and spaced apart at regular intervals to give the same solid area fraction of 0.8. Evaluation of the water collection efficiencies of the tested configurations revealed that 1 mm wide superhydrophilic strips was the most efficient, achieving double the amount of water harvested compared with 2.8 mm wide strips. This finding was attributed to the low Stokes numbers of the aerosol particle distribution of the fog which tended to result in them being brought by the flow streamlines toward the air gaps between the strips. Stagnant flow regions at the edges of each strip, revealed through potential flow calculations, then caused higher liquid imbibition and impaction there for water harvesting. It was also found that the Cassie nonwetting substrates that originally exhibited contact angles of 161Â° transformed to Wenzel wetting with zero contact angle within 60 min of fog interception. Optical profilometry revealed no obvious difference in surface roughness between the central region and edges of the strips, indicating that surface morphology was unlikely to be a contributing factor for enhanced water collection at the edges. The findings here indicated that highly wetting vertical strip architectures with narrow widths (1 mm) were favorable over wider strips for water harvesting provided that clogging and re-entrainment were not significant factors."

"Kaldorian Disaggregation, Temporary Migration and Welfare: Theory and Calibration Balance of Payments; Post Keynesian; Income In this paper we examine a four-good, four-factor model of trade with two agents: domestic residents and temporary migrants. This modelling framework has three important features: first, there are two tradable and two non-tradable goods; second, there exists Kaldorian disaggregation in consumption; third, the structure incorporates a combination of price adjustment. The results emphasize the influence of factor accumulation at constant traded goods prices on the variable prices of non-traded goods. We also analyse the impact of temporary migration and other structural parameters on domestic welfare. To highlight our results, our model is calibrated on a typical small open economy, Hong Kong, and a wide array of situations are presented when temporary migration and Kaldorian disaggregation can reduce domestic welfare in response to exogenous shocks."
"Good regulation versus bad regulation Derivative Markets; Financial Markets; Bankruptcy Code The debate on regulation typically revolves around the quantity of regulation and the choice between regulation and deregulation. While the global financial crisis has taught us that regulation is necessary, this does not mean that regulation cannot be counterproductive. Good regulation is any regulation that reduces the extent of fraud and corruption in the financial sector without imposing excessively high costs on the society. Several examples of good regulation and bad regulation are discussed."
"All-fiber impurity collector based on laser-induced microbubble Fiberoptic Cable; Incandescence; Optical Cables Microbubbles have attracted interests in polluted water treatment industry. We proposed and constructed an all-fiber impurity collector based on the laser-induced microbubbles characteristics for polluted water treatment. Without any special pretreatment, such as metallically coating or carbon materials doping, the proposed impurity collector performed microbubbles generation and impurities extraction and collection. We employed the graphite oxide nanoplatelets in an aqueous solution to construct the polluted water environment to show the performance of the all-fiber impurity collector. With the optimal incident laser power of 11 mW, we performed the collection efficiency as high as 16.3Ã—10 4 /s. The optimal microbubbles diameter was in the range of 80â€“120 Î¼m. The proposed all-fiber impurity collector extends the potential applications of fiber-based optical manipulation for polluted water treatment."
"Flexible employment policies, temporal control and health promoting practices: A qualitative study in two Australian worksites Work-Family Conflict; Work-Life Balance; Personnel For four decades, theories of job demand-control have proposed that higher occupational status groups have lower health risks due to the stress accompanying jobs featuring high demands but high control. This research examines whether Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) can improve the health prospects of a range of workers by giving greater control over work time arrangements. Our setting is Australia, where FWAs were introduced in 2009. In line with these early studies alongside studies of work-life balance, we expected to observe that workers with access to control over daily work times could better control the activities outside of work that influence chronic disease. Using a practice sociology approach, we compared the accounts of twenty-eight workers in blue and white collar industries with differing degrees of work time flexibility. The findings do not contradict early theories describing occupational differences of job demand-control dynamics and their relationship to health risks. However, this study suggests that a) time demands and strains have increased for a broad sweep of workers since the 1980s, b) the greater control of higher occupational status groups has been eroded by the high performance movement, which has attracted less scrutiny than FWAs, and c) more workers are forced to adapt their daily lives, including their approach to health, to accommodate their job demands. Job insecurity further impedes preventative health practices adoption. What might appear to be worker-controlled flexibility can-under the pressures of job insecurity and performance expectations without time limits-transform into health-eroding unpredictability. The answer however is not greater flexibility in the absence of limits on the well-documented precursors of work stress: long hours, job insecurity and intensity-related exhaustion. While there have been welcome developments in job demand-control-health conceptualizations, they typically ignore the out-of-work temporal demands that workers face and which compound on-the-job demands. Redesign of the temporalities of working life within worksites need to be accompanied by society-level policies which address caring responsibilities, gender equality as well as broad labour market conditions."
"Biological entities as chemical reactors for synthesis of nanomaterials: Progress, challenges and future perspective Silver Nanoparticles; Green Synthesis; Biofabrication Synthesis of nanomaterials is being gained extensive attention in the fields of chemistry, applied physics, catalysis, drug delivery and the most important in diagnosis and therapeutic applications. Recently, many reports have been published on physical and chemical synthesis of magnetic as well as metallic nanoparticles (NPs) with viable surface functionalization, but still there is a dire need of such strategies that can combine synthetic methodology with stable surface modification found in nature. Synthesis of NPs via biological methods is the possible way to solve these barriers. However, systematized summary and outlooks of NPs synthesis via biological entities with various influencing factors e.g. temperature, pH, concentration of reactants and reaction time has rarely been reported. This review will present the distinct advantages of biological synthesis of NPs over physical and chemical methods. It will also highlight the recent progress on synthesis of NPs via various biological systems i.e. plant, fungus, bacteria, and yeast. Furthermore, it will explain various factors that control the size, shape, and morphology of these NPs. Finally, it would present the future perspectives of green chemistry for the development of nano-science and -biotechnology."
"Metal-Acid Synergy: Hydrodeoxygenation of Anisole over Pt/Al-SBA-15 Bio-Oil; Catalyst; Guaiacol Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a promising technology to upgrade fast pyrolysis bio-oils but it requires active and selective catalysts. Here we explore the synergy between the metal and acid sites in the HDO of anisole, a model pyrolysis bio-oil compound, over mono- and bi-functional Pt/(Al)-SBA-15 catalysts. Ring hydrogenation of anisole to methoxycyclohexane occurs over metal sites and is structure sensitive; it is favored over small (4 nm) Pt nanoparticles, which confer a turnover frequency (TOF) of approximately 2000 h-1 and a methoxycyclohexane selectivity of approximately 90 % at 200 Â°C and 20 bar H2 ; in contrast, the formation of benzene and the desired cyclohexane product appears to be structure insensitive. The introduction of acidity to the SBA-15 support promotes the demethyoxylation of the methoxycyclohexane intermediate, which increases the selectivity to cyclohexane from 15 to 92 % and the cyclohexane productivity by two orders of magnitude (from 15 to 6500 mmol gPt-1 h-1 ). Optimization of the metal-acid synergy confers an 865-fold increase in the cyclohexane production per gram of Pt and a 28-fold reduction in precious metal loading. These findings demonstrate that tuning the metal-acid synergy provides a strategy to direct complex catalytic reaction networks and minimize precious metal use in the production of bio-fuels."
"Model Validation of a Three-Phase Inverter EMT Model in DIgSILENT Power Factory Inverters; Electric Current Control; Connected Ongoing global efforts to reduce carbon emissions are leading to a technological transformation of electrical grids from fossil fuel energy production using rotating machines, to renewable energy production using power electronic converters. However, conventional power system modelling and simulation approaches (i.e. root-mean-square strategies) are unable to adequately analyse power system dynamics with grid connected inverters. This is because accurate representation of the transient behaviour of a physical inverter system requires a high-resolution detailed time domain inverter simulation model. This paper presents a discrete-time approach to modelling such a grid connected inverter system, which accurately represents its transient response using an electromagnetic transient (EMT) DIgSILENT Power Factory model of a three-phase grid-connected inverter, current regulated in the synchronous reference frame (SRF). The performance of the developed EMT model has been confirmed by comparison against a known, and previously experimentally validated, time domain inverter model developed in PSIM."

"Trace element concentrations in feathers of seven petrels (Pterodroma spp.) Feathers; Birds; Grus Japonensis Gadfly petrels (Pterodroma spp.) are one of the most threatened and poorly studied seabird groups, and as marine predators, are exposed to biomagnified and bioaccumulated chemical pollutants from their prey. We quantified trace element concentrations in breast feathers of seven petrel species that breed in the southern hemisphere to quantify current concentrations. Selenium (Se) concentrations were significantly lower in chicks than adults; this was not observed for zinc (Zn) or lead (Pb). Overall, the species examined here exhibited similar concentrations of Se, with Pb and Zn concentrations more variable among species. The mean Se concentration in adult birds exceeded those thought to be potentially deleterious, and three species had concentrations that were above the assumed threshold for Pb toxicity. Further investigation of potentially toxic trace elements in gadfly petrels is warranted."
"Internalizing animals and ecosystems in social citizenship and social policy: From political community to political country Environmental Justice; Injustice; Air Quality The aim of this editorial is to explore, conceptualize, and research the need to internalize both animals and ecosystems in our understanding of social citizenship and social policy. This editorial should be seen as a brief overview of the themes that should be covered in the contributions to the Special Issue, â€œInternalizing Animals and Ecosystems in Social Citizenship and Social Policy: From Political Community to Political Countryâ€. This Special Issue argues the importance of integrating animals and ecosystems as a way to reâ€politicize humansâ€™ social relation with both animals and our ecosystem as in sustainable development and social policy. If environmental policy becomes social policy, we would reâ€construct social citizenship to include consideration for animals and ecosystems as integral part of social policy. This expansion in scope is a progression from seeing humans as part of a political community to becoming more involved in their political country. This aligns with the concept of Countryâ€”an allâ€encompassing term in Australia, involving a peopleâ€™s territory, land, water, biological resources, the complex obligations and relationships involved."
"Executive pay disparity and cost of debt financing Executive Compensation; Firm; Chief Executive Officer Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between executive pay disparity and the cost of debt. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a sample of syndicated bank loans granted to United States (US) listed firms from 1992 to 2014 and adopt the loan yield spread (Chief Executive Officer (CEO) pay slice) as the main proxy for the cost of debt (executive pay disparity). The authors also use the Heckman two-stage model to address the sample selection bias and the two-stage least squares and propensity score matching methods to control the potential endogeneity issues. To test different views about executive pay disparity, the authors adopt the cash-to-stock ratio to proxy for managerial risk-shifting incentives. Findings: The authors find that the cost of debt is significantly higher for firms with larger executive pay disparity, which is robust to sample selection bias, endogeneity concerns, alternative measures and various controls. This positive relationship increases with the risk-shifting incentives of CEOs instead of other top executives, which supports the managerial power view, and is stronger for firms with higher levels of financial distress. The findings suggest that creditors view executive pay disparity are associated with higher credit risk and CEO entrenchment. Originality/value: This paper reveals one â€œdarkâ€ side of executive pay disparity: it increases the cost of debt and identifies a significant role played by CEOs' risk-shifting incentives. The authors provide direct evidence of the relevance of pay differential to corporate credit analysis."
"CaT Pin: A Wearable to Detect Loneliness ""The number of lone-person households is increasing around the world.  While loneliness is a significant risk factor for a range of mental and physical health problems, including premature death, it can be hard to identify and offer timely interventions. The importance of word count in language acquisition, IQ and autism in children is well recognised, yet little work has been done on the use of word count as a proxy for loneliness in the elderly. Technology that is co-designed and human centred, particularly that places minimal demand on the individual to learn new procedures or interface with tablets or smart phones, offers a way to address this gap and to reduce loneliness and social isolation in older people.

The CaT Pin (Conversation as Therapy) has been developed by a multidisciplinary team working at the intersection of design, health, and technology. The pin is an outwardly conventional wearable object (e.g., a brooch) enhanced with a sensitive digital microphone and a tiny embedded microprocessor with an integrated Bluetooth low energy (BLE) transceiver. The pin monitors and processes ambient sounds surrounding the wearer in order to identify possible speech sequences within the background noise. The pin does not interpret or recognise actual content, rather it simply identifies and counts words over an interval, a significantly more straightforward problem than full speech recognition, and one that sidesteps privacy issues. The pin can be linked to real time intervention services (e.g., via SMS) and is designed to support further research activities into loneliness assessment.

"Chlorination disadvantages and alternative routes for biofouling control in reverse osmosis desalination Osmosis Membranes; Reverse Osmosis; Desalination With an ever-increasing human population, access to clean water for human use is a growing concern across the world. Seawater desalination to produce usable water is essential to meet future clean water demand. Desalination processes, such as reverse osmosis and multi-stage flash have been implemented worldwide. Reverse osmosis is the most effective technology, which uses a semipermeable membrane to produce clean water under an applied pressure. However, membrane biofouling is the main issue faced by such plants, which requires continuous cleaning or regular replacement of the membranes. Chlorination is the most commonly used disinfection process to pretreat the water to reduce biofouling. Although chlorination is widely used, it has several disadvantages, such as formation of disinfection by-products and being ineffective against some types of microbes. This review aims to discuss the adverse effect of chlorination on reverse osmosis membranes and to identify other possible alternatives of chlorination to reduce biofouling of the membranes. Reverse osmosis membrane degradation and mitigation of chlorines effects, along with newly emerging disinfection technologies, are discussed, providing insight to both academic institutions and industries for the design of improved reverse osmosis systems."
"Exploring tripartite praxis for the REDD + forest climate change initiative through community based ecotourism Destination; Ecotourism; Destination Management Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is a United Nations programme initiated in 2008 with the aim of mitigating climate change through the preservation of the worldâ€™s existing forest stocks. One of the challenges in its successful implementation has been community involvement in its design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The purpose of this study is to assess what REDD + can learn from the experience of Community-Based Ecotourism (CBET), which operates under many of the same conditions. A critical review of the related literature using the Scopus database was undertaken using three search strings including â€œREDD+â€ (2,913 listings), â€œcommunity-based ecotourismâ€ (113 listings) and â€œREDD + and tourismâ€ (6 listings) to identify the variables and themes related to each. Despite the significant increase in the number of publications on REDD + since 2008, only one was specifically related to ecotourism. We argue that CBET understood as a form of social capital can function as an enabling platform for REDD+, in particular its implementation of international conservation policy by working with local communities/indigenous peoples and business stakeholders, referred to here as the â€œtripartite praxisâ€. We demonstrate how CBET can act as a basis from which to guide internationally driven incentive-based conservation policy and community entrepreneurship within a social capital framework."
"Intentions for a third child: The role of parental sex composition preferences Son Preference; Sex Ratio; Fertility We investigate the effect of parents' sex composition preferences on intentions for a third child in India. Parents' preference for sex composition are balanced or mixed gender (a son and a daughter) or gender biased, commonly for a son, and are expected to change over time. Pooled sample of 22,290 couples with two children from the National Family Health Surveys (NFHS), conducted in 2005/6 and 2015/16 is used to analyze couples' sex composition preferences and its effect on third child intentions. Our results show that desire for a son dominates the preference for balanced sex composition over the ten-year period, as couples with two daughters are 7 to 9 times more likely to intend to have a third child. This intention for third child is moderated by women's education and media exposure. Parental preference for a male child continues to be a significant driver for couples exceeding the two children norm in India. Policies promoting women's education will have spillover effects on fertility intentions but would not fully close the gap caused by preference for son. Purposeful policy efforts for changing these preferences need to work synchronously with the broader efforts to address gender inequality."
"Gender, households, and decision-making for wildfire safety Wildfires; Wildland-Urban Interface; Disaster This paper considers the impact of gendered norms on decision-making for wildfire preparation and response at the household level. Focusing on Australia, it provides a theoretical thematic analysis of data acquired in 107 interviews with residents of nine different localities. It builds on existing research on gender and disaster, as well as on decision-making and wildfires, and analyses the narratives that centre on â€˜splitâ€™ households plans (where a male partner plans to stay and a female partner plans to evacuate) and disagreements within heterosexual couples as to an appropriate wildfire safety plan. The study finds that gender inequality and differences in gendered expectations are likely to create difficult conditions for negotiation between members of a heterosexual couple when there is disagreement over a plan and that this may contribute to risky decision-making practices and outcomes. The paper reiterates, therefore, the importance of taking into account the social construction of gender in wildfire research and policy."
"Heavy metal ion adsorption by permeable oyster shell bricks Cadmium; Dissolved Organic Carbon; Animal Shells More than 60% of oyster shells (OS) are discarded on the beach, which pollute the soil. At 800 Â°C, OS completely cracks into calcium oxide (CaO), which has the physical adsorption characteristic of a mesoporous structure. The permeable oyster shell bricks (POSB) used for purifying water were made by improving the process with OS as an aggregate. The adsorption effect on heavy metal ions in landscape water under different OS contents, adsorption times and pH values was investigated by using POSB via atomic absorption spectrometry. The results show that the optimum OS content for the standard weight (2.5 kg) POSB is 515â€“525 g, and the effect of the adsorption of nickel (Ni(II)), zinc (Zn(II)) and manganese (Mn(II)) were Ni(II) > Zn(II) > Mn(II) in the water environment with pH values of 7.5â€“7.9 for a long time period (>22 h). However, the adsorption effect of trace copper (Cu(II)) was not significant at the same time. The mesoporous structure of CaO has coordination centers and hydroxyl functional groups that have a strong adsorption effect on Ni(II), Zn(II) and Mn(II) to form complexes in the alkaline environment, and microscale Ca(II) can exchange ions with Ni(II), Zn(II) and Mn(II) to produce chemical precipitates. POSB were used in the simulation of sidewalks, squares and the revetment of a park. The experimental results show that the POSB of the revetment absorbs a larger amount of heavy metal ions than others due to a longer soak. The result shows that the POSB has a continuous adsorption effect and has great potential for wastewater treatment."

Old and Appreciated: Exploring the Influence of Material Ageing on the Aesthetic Appreciation of Everyday Products Materials Selection; Multicriteria Decision-making; Decision Making There is a growing interest in design research to explore sustainable consumption via products that are cherished as they age. This paper presents an empirical study exploring the influence of patina (signs of surface aging) on consumers' willingness to discard products and aesthetic appreciation. Results show participants are predisposed to discard everyday products regardless aesthetic qualities (patina). This implies designers should look beyond the presence of pure aesthetic qualities of aging and emphasise symbolic qualities of aging to stimulate appreciation as products age.

"A review of cultural background and thermal perceptions in urban environments Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Microclimate Thermal comfort is among the chief indicators of the sustainability of outdoor spaces. However, the complex nature of comfort represents the interaction of several determinants that leads to a perception of the thermal environment. Recently, researchers have paid particular attention to non-physical factors to understand the mechanisms involved in thermal perceptions in urban environments. The extant literature has contended that culture and cultural background are determinants to individualsâ€™ thermal perceptions. Therefore, this study aimed to review how the link between outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) and cultural background is investigated. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first review study on the subject. The study used a systematic literature review approach based on secondary data available in relevant and contemporary literature. The findings first showed the scarcity of research on cultural background and OTC; however, all studies identified corroborated the significant impact of cultural background on thermal perceptions. Notably, the cultural background was found to be the source of variation in thermal perceptions, tolerance to, and preference for certain thermal conditions, thermal comfort requirements and expectations, choice of clothing, and environmental attitudes. The findings provide a sound basis for future researchers to address the research gaps identified. The study also raises policy makersâ€™ and designersâ€™ awareness of urban environment usersâ€™ genuine needs and requirements."
"The potential of new technologies to disrupt housing policy Planning; GIS; Cartography The research identified four main fields of technological advancement that are likely to disrupt the housing sector in future, or are already doing so: matching markets; big data; GIS mapping software; and blockchain. Technological change presents real opportunities for the housing sector, including more efficient allocation of housing stock, more accurate and transparent property management systems, and better informed planning and development processes. At the same time, however, the most advanced technological disruption to date in the housing spaceâ€”the matching market Airbnbâ€”highlights the ways in which responding to and regulating disruptive technologies presents new challenges for governments and is challenging for governments. Key challenges include the protection of privacy, the need to ensure transparency in increasingly complex technological systems, the cost and access risks associated with the commercialisation of significant technological systems, and the potential for disruption in one housing market to cause negative spillover effects in other parts of the housing sector. In responding to future technological disruptions, governments need more agile and critical policy making approaches to allow effective short-term responses to digital disruptions, as well as strategies for implementing longer-term cultural change and systems upgrades. The report identifies 10 key principles and strategies as a starting point for developing this new policy making â€˜playbookâ€™."

"Accurate Underwater Optical Wireless Communication Model With Both Line-of-Sight and Non-Line-of-Sight Channels Bit Error Rate; Optical Wireless; Forward Error Correction Underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) systems have been widely studied to achieve high-speed wireless communications. To investigate and design UOWC systems, a mathematical model to characterize the accurate performance of UOWC systems is important. However, the previous mathematical models of UOWC systems have limitations, which mainly focused on the line-of-sight (LOS) link, and only considered the vertical incident background light or optical filters with constant transmittance for simplicity. To overcome these limitations, we establish an accurate UOWC system model, incorporating the previously overlooked impact of signal and sun lights incident angles and including both LOS and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels. Our proposed accurate UOWC system model is validated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Results show that our proposed model can capture the changes of received powers of both signal and background lights with various transmitter and receiver alignments and orientations in both LOS and NLOS channels, which typically affect the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) and bit-error-rate (BER) performance of UOWC systems. Furthermore, we show that the incident angles of both signal and sun lights have significant impact on the system performance, and our proposed model can be used to optimize the PD rotation angle to improve the SNR performance. Therefore, the more accurate UOWC channel model established in this paper provides a fundamental framework for future UOWC system design and optimization."
"Global projection of lead-zinc supply from known resources Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals Lead and zinc are used extensively in the construction and automotive industries, and require sustainable supply. In order to understand the future availability of lead and zinc, we have projected global supplies on a country-by-country basis from a detailed global assessment of mineral resources for 2013. The model GeRS-DeMo was used to create projections of lead and zinc production from ores, as well as recycling for lead. Our modelling suggests that lead and zinc production from known resources is set to peak within 15 years (lead 2025, zinc 2031). For lead, the total supply declines relatively slowly post peak due to recycling. If additional resources are found, these peaks would shift further into the future. These results suggest that lead and zinc consumers will need to plan for the future, potentially by: seeking alternative supplies (e.g., mine tailings, smelter/refinery slags); obtaining additional value from critical metals contained in lead-zinc ore deposits to counter lower grade ores; identifying potential substitutes; redesigning their products; or by contributing to the development of recycling industries."
"Thermal and environmental impact analysis of rice husk ash-based mortar as insulating wall plaster Cement; Rice Hulls; Mortar The energy used to maintain the thermal comfort of buildings significantly contributes to the GHG emissions and global warming. In this study, a sustainable and cost-effective rice husk ash (RHA)-based mortar for wall plastering has been developed to provide better thermal insulation, reduce the operational energy and enhance the thermal comfort. Consequently, RHA was partially replaced with the sand in the conventional mortar to produce the RHA-based plaster. Initially, compressive strengths and thermal conductivities of the selected mortar mixes were assessed. The results highlight that the RHA can be replaced up to 30% instead of sand in mortar to produce the thermally enhanced wall plaster. Further, two identical prototype model houses were constructed with RHA-based (i.e. 30% of RHA) and conventional plasters to evaluate their heat transfer, heat flux, and the characteristics of internal and external wall surface temperatures in open weather conditions. It was noted that the average peak heat flux reduction formed by the RHA-based plaster was 10%. The average daily heat transfer reduction across the wall with RHA-based plaster was about 26%. Results also show that RHA-based plaster can reduce the energy that required to maintain thermal comfort by about 9% than the conventional plaster. Moreover, the environmental impact analysis was also conducted to assess the sustainability performance of RHA-based mortars. The environmental impact assessment revealed that the RHA-based plaster has less environmental impact than the conventional mortar. Furthermore, the CO2 emission generated by the production of RHA-based mortar is about 14% less than the conventional plaster."
"Achieving the SDGs: Evaluating indicators to be used to benchmark and monitor progress towards creating healthy and sustainable cities Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians In 2016, the World Health Organization declared that â€˜Health is one of the most effective markers of any city's successful sustainable developmentâ€™ (World Health Organisation, 2016). With estimates that around 6.7 billion people will live in cities by 2050, 21st century city planning decisions will play a critical role in achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They will determine the city structure and access to health-enhancing (or health-damaging) urban environments, and ultimately lifestyle choices that impact both individual and planetary health. Benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating city planning policies and interventions is therefore critical to optimise urban outcomes. In 2017, the UN adopted a global SDG indicator framework, calling for complementary national and regional indicators to be collected by member countries. UN Habitat has also developed an indicator action framework specifically for cities. This paper examined the extent to which the UN indicators will help cities evaluate their efforts to deliver sustainability and health outcomes. It identified inconsistencies between the two UN indicator frameworks. Many of the SDG indicators assess outcomes, rather than the comprehensive and integrated â€˜upstreamâ€™ policies and interventions required to deliver outcomes on-the-ground. Conversely, the UN Habitat framework incorporates intervention indicators, but excludes health outcome indicators. A more comprehensive approach to benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating policies designed to achieve healthy and sustainable cities and assessing spatial inequities is proposed."
"Mapping sustainability indicators for circular built environment in the Global South Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer a framework for a better future by focusing on people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnerships. SDGs directly relating to the built environment are SDG 11, SDG 9 and SDG 12. The SDGs do not explicitly mention circular thinking or practices. Yet, the principles underpinning sustainability and circularity are the same, especially those focusing on resource efficiency and conservation. The aim of this paper is to map the SDGs against circular built environment indicators in the Global South. In doing so, not only is the alignment between the National Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the built environment established, but the significant position that the built environment plays in the rapidly growing cities of the Global South is also strongly supported. Using secondary research, this paper first investigates the primary and secondary SDG indicators for achieving circular built environments by the One Planet Network's Sustainable Buildings and Construction programme. This is then validated by undertaking workshops with experts in the Global South to determine an interim set of SDG indicators relate to circular economy such as local jobs, design considering climate mitigation, resilience and adaptation and such other indicators. The paper recommends priority indicators for achieving circular built environments in the Global South and suggests further research needs to be undertaken to finalise these indicators."
"TSS 5 year report - Design a survey to capture the national effort towards feral cat management In measuring the year 5 targets under the Threatened Species Strategy to cull 2,000,000 feral cats,
10 million hectares of best practice cat control and 2 million hectares of best practice cat control on
Commonwealth Land, we are collecting data through state and territory agencies, natural resource
management organisations and through Australian Government grants. This data builds upon the results of
the stratified survey conducted by RMIT for year one and year three reporting.
To capture the overall effort and get the most complete picture of feral cat management, including an
understanding of the geographical scale and management trends, we need to build on previous monitoring
and reporting methods such as a stratified survey to uncover effort in groups such as private landholders,
recreational shooters and community groups. The data obtained will be used to communicate progress
against the year 5 feral cat targets in the Strategy. The data will also help to identify factors that may have
impeded feral cat control including bushfire events and COVID-19."
"Traditionalism vs egalitarianism: Is there an association between gender attitudes and mental health? Child Care; Time Use; Domestic Division of Labour Objective: This study sought to assess the extent to which gender attitudes are associated with mental health among Australian men and women. Methods: This study used a sample of 26,188 individuals drawn from five waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. Gender attitudes were classified into three groups (traditional, moderate-egalitarian and egalitarian), and were constructed from six items. Mental health was measured using the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). We calculated the magnitude of associations between gender attitudes and mental health, stratified by gender, and adjusted for potential confounding. Results: Compared to men with egalitarian attitudes, poorer mental health was observed among men with moderate-egalitarian (âˆ’1.16, 95% confidence interval = [âˆ’1.84, âˆ’0.49]) and traditional gender attitudes (âˆ’2.57, 95% confidence interval = [âˆ’3.33, âˆ’1.81]). Among women, poorer mental health was observed among those with moderate-egalitarian (âˆ’0.78, 95% confidence interval = [âˆ’1.34, âˆ’0.22]) and traditional attitudes (âˆ’1.91, 95% confidence interval = [âˆ’2.55, âˆ’1.26]) compared to those with egalitarian attitudes. Conclusions: For both men and women, egalitarian gender attitudes were associated with better mental health."
"Increasing Use of Human-Dominated Habitats as CO2 Emissions Warm and Acidify Oceans Biodiversity; Patellogastropoda; Intertidal Community Urban and artificial structures are increasingly added to the worldâ€™s coasts during a time in which changing climate is forecast to drive shifts in naturally occurring habitats. We ask whether the role of artificial structures as marine habitats will increase in importance relative to their natural counterparts, particularly as natural habitats are negatively affected by ocean warming and acidification. To evaluate this model, we contrasted use of natural (kelp forest and turfing algae) and artificial habitat (plastic pier-piling) by a nest-building amphipod (Cymadusa pemptos) under current and future climate conditions of CO2 and temperature. Under future conditions, amphipod populations in mesocosms increased, but this did not lead to greater proportional colonization of kelp and turf. Instead, colonization doubled in artificial habitats, and there was increasing production and occupation of nests on artificial habitats relative to natural habitats. In an age when human modification of natural substrata is increasingly cited as an agent of wildlife decline, understanding the future role of artificial habitats as replacement dwellings for natural habitats is critical.

"Gut Microbial Changes, Interactions, and Their Implications on Human Lifecycle: An Ageing Perspective Intestine Flora; Ruminococcaceae; Microorganisms Gut microbiota is established during birth and evolves with age, mostly maintaining the commensal relationship with the host. A growing body of clinical evidence suggests an intricate relationship between the gut microbiota and the immune system. With ageing, the gut microbiota develops significant imbalances in the major phyla such as the anaerobic Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as well as a diverse range of facultative organisms, resulting in impaired immune responses. Antimicrobial therapy is commonly used for the treatment of infections; however, this may also result in the loss of normal gut flora. Advanced age, antibiotic use, underlying diseases, infections, hormonal differences, circadian rhythm, and malnutrition, either alone or in combination, contribute to the problem. This nonbeneficial gastrointestinal modulation may be reversed by judicious and controlled use of antibiotics and the appropriate use of prebiotics and probiotics. In certain persistent, recurrent settings, the option of faecal microbiota transplantation can be explored. The aim of the current review is to focus on the establishment and alteration of gut microbiota, with ageing. The review also discusses the potential role of gut microbiota in regulating the immune system, together with its function in healthy and diseased state."
"Task interdependence and the discrimination of gay men and lesbians in the workplace Transgender Persons; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Workplace Research on occupational segregation has found that gay men and lesbians concentrate in occupations with high task independence. This research proposed that gay men and lesbians self-select into such occupations, as it may be easier to manage their sexual orientation if they do not interact closely with others. We provide a complementary explanation that the high concentration of gay men and lesbians in high-task-independent jobs may be due to bias during the selection stage. We conducted two studies to examine (a) whether discrimination at the point of hiring limits gay men and lesbiansâ€™ access to high-task-interdependent occupations, and (b) whether gay men and lesbians in task-interdependent jobs are less likely to be invited to socialize by coworkers. We found that gay men and lesbians are discriminated against for task-interdependent occupations by hiring personnel, but notably are more likely to be invited to socialize outside of work by coworkers if they are in task-interdependent jobs. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice of occupational segregation of gay men and lesbians specifically and for other minority or stigmatized groups in general."
"Street vending and co-production: key lessons during the COVID-19 pandemic Informality; Slums; Governance The COVID-19 global pandemic has prompted governments to resort to or allow quasi-formal means to provide basic goods and services to communities that were forced into quarantine. We analyze how grassroots self-help strategies interact with the adaptation mechanisms of formal governance under crisis conditions. Drawing on empirical insights in Manila (Philippines) and Hanoi (Vietnam), we examine the practices that have enabled street vendors in the two metropolises to earn a living and to provide needed services to city residents. We explain how some lessons on co-production practices might inform post-pandemic recovery strategies and future policy-making processes in global South cities."
"Propagation of fully coherent and partially coherent complex scalar fields in aberration space Phase Contrast; Gratings; Radiography We consider the propagation of both fully coherent and partially coherent complex scalar fields, through linear shift-invariant imaging systems. The state of such imaging systems is characterized by a countable infinity of aberration coefficients, the values for which can be viewed as coordinates for an infinity of orthogonal axes that span the aberration space into which the output propagates. For fully coherent complex scalar disturbances, we study the propagation of the field through the imaging system, while for partially coherent disturbances it is the two-point correlation functions whose propagation we study. For both systems we write down generalized propagators in both real and Fourier space, differential equations for evolution through aberration space, transport equations, and Hamilton-Jacobi equations. A generalized form of the Wolf equations is a special case of our formalism."
"Population- and sex-specific sensitivity of the marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa to metal exposure Gammarus Fossarum; Potamopyrgus Antipodarum; Bioassay The sensitivity to contaminants of natural populations varies greatly depending on their historical exposure and on the sex of the individual. These factors result in great uncertainty in ecotoxicological risk assessments and challenge the protection of marine biodiversity. This study investigated the role of background pollution in the environment in shaping the sensitivity of males and females of the common marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa to the common trace marine pollutant, copper (Cu). Female and male amphipods were collected from two sites: Geelong (the polluted site) and Clifton Springs (the clean site). Amphipods were exposed to Cu treatments of 0, 50, 100, and 250 Î¼g/L for 10 days, followed by a 10-day recovery period. Cu-exposed males from Geelong showed a reduction in feeding rate at a higher Cu concentration than males from Clifton Springs, suggesting that they have a higher tolerance to Cu than males from Clifton Springs. This can be explained by their higher base level of metallothioneins (MTs) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), the key physiological responses for detoxification and defence against damages from Cu toxicity. Males showed a higher tolerance to Cu than females. This pattern was similar in both populations, which may be associated with a higher level of GST. During the recovery period, only males from Geelong fully recovered to the control level. Our results emphasize the importance of considering population- and sex-specific sensitivity of invertebrates to contaminants in ecotoxicological risk assessments."
"Environmental impact of discarded apparel landfilling and recycling Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing Globally, around 87% of discarded textiles ended up in landfill, of which more than 90% are reusable and recyclable. Recycling textile waste to other value-added products is economically feasible. To integrate recycling into the apparel waste stream, it is important to know the environmental benefit and impact of the different recycling options. This study presents the environmental performance of apparel recycling and landfill using the life cycle assessment methodology in terms of climate change, acidification, agricultural land occupation and water depletion. Landfill scenarios and recycling scenarios of post-consumer household discarded apparel waste have been developed in the context of Australia. This study finds that the landfill process of natural apparel waste contributes more environmental impact credit compared to synthetic apparel, and this is mainly credited from the power generation from landfill methane gas captured. This study also specifies that the environmental benefit from the landfill process of discarded apparel depends on the ratio of natural fibre and synthetic fibre in discarded apparel. Integration of recycling into the apparel waste stream can potentially generate environmental benefits. A recycling scenario of cleaning wipes shows the highest impact benefits, followed by cotton fibre, insulation material and polyester raw material recycling. Net impact savings of recycling depend on the avoided landfill impact and avoided virgin production impact. The results generated from this study can be useful for future policy recommendations on apparel waste management through recycling. It is clear that increased collection of apparel by recyclers can significantly reduce environmental impact."
"Impact of microalgae species and solution salinity on algal treatment of wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Six common microalgal species, including freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus abundans, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Coelastrum microporum, and marine microalgae Nannochloropsis salina and Dunaliella tertiolecta, were tested in batch treatment to identify the most promising species for remediating a municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC). Selected species were then studied at different ROC salinity levels (5, 10, and 15 g TDS/L) in semi-continuous treatment to evaluate their potential for nutrient remediation, and biogas production through anaerobic digestion. S. abundans, C. vulgaris, and N. salina showed higher potential for growth and nutrient remediation under salinity stress. Further tests revealed that N. salina adapted well to ROC conditions, and S. abundans could grow better and had higher tolerance to the elevated salinity than C. vulgaris. S. abundans and N. salina performed better for removing nutrients and organic matter (11.5â€“18 mg/L/d TN, 7.1â€“8.2 mg/L/d TP, and 8.6â€“12.4 mg/L/d DOC). Increasing salinity led to growth inhibition and N uptake reduction for freshwater species but had no significant effect on TP removal. Biochemical methane potential tests showed the algal biomass produced a significant amount of methane (e.g., up to 422 mL CH4/g VS for N. salina), suggesting the algae generated from the ROC treatment could produce significant amounts of energy through anaerobic digestion without the need for pretreatment. This study showed the environmental and economic potential of the algal system for future applications."

"A multicointegration model of global climate change Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; Sea Surface Temperature; Climate Prediction We model the role of the ocean in climate change, using the concept of multicointegration. Surface temperature and radiative forcing cointegrate and the accumulated cointegration disequilibria represent the change in Earth system heat content, which is predominantly stored in the ocean. System heat content in turn cointegrates with surface temperature. Using a multicointegrating I(2) model, we find that the climate sensitivity is 2.8 Â°C and the rate of adjustment to equilibrium is realistically slow. These results contrast strongly with those from I(1) cointegration models and are more consistent with global circulation models. We also estimate Earth system heat content as a latent variable for the full period, 1850â€“2014, and this predicted heat content cointegrates with available ocean heat content observations for 1940â€“2014."
"The internal capability of Vietnam social sciences and humanities: A perspective from the 2008-2019 dataset Co-Authorship; Scientific Collaboration; Bibliometric Analysis International collaboration contributes significantly to improving scientific performance in Vietnam, but it also results in Vietnamese researchers depending on foreign partners to get their work published. The current study is an initial effort to examine the domestic research capability ofVietnam's Social Science and Humanities (SSH) disciplines through scientific productivity. The research focuses on investigating various aspects, including leading Vietnamese authors, solo authors, and gender difference, as well as international and domestic collaboration networks. The study extracts the data of 2040 Vietnamese SSH authors, 1981 foreign authors, and 3160 publications during the period of 2008-2019, from the exclusive Social Sciences and Humanities Peer Awards (SSHPA) database. Findings show a steadily rising contribution from leading domestic authors in SSH research, with an annual growth rate of approximately 22.33%. Moreover, 77.26% of publications are led by Vietnamese researchers. The proportion of publications by Vietnamese authors increased dramatically and surpassed the proportion of internationally collaborated publications in 2019, at 55.83%. The domestic research collaboration network has expanded in an observable manner. However, the participation rate of women in SSH research was relatively low, at an average of 37.30%. While the self-sustaining capacity of SSH researchers and institutes in Vietnam has been rising, gender inequality remains prevalent. In order to further strengthen and promote the scholarly community, as well as their research capacity, and to maintain public trust in SSH research, we recommend that policymakers encourage self-sustaining research, nationwide collaboration, and empower female researchers."
"The effect of fossil fuel-based electricity plant location on property values: evidence from Australia Hedonic Analysis; Property Values; Hedonic Pricing This article investigates the effect of fossil fuel-fired power plant locations on the value of neighbourhood properties in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Fossil fuels account for a significant proportion of electricity generation in Australia. Thus, there are growing community concerns regarding the possible negative environmental effects of these power plants given the high levels of emissions produced by these plants. Such concerns could potentially impact on property values. We use a comprehensive dataset with the exact location of each property to estimate the effects of existing fossil fuel-fired power plants on the value of neighbourhood properties. We use spatial econometric models to estimate these effects with controls over several property characteristics and the type of power plant. Our results suggest that coal-fired power plants have significant negative effects on property values within a specific radius. These effects are likely to be lower but still negative for properties in the vicinity of gas-fired and gas reciprocating power plants."

"Corporate social responsibility, firm performance and the moderating effect of earnings management in Chinese firms Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm performance and the moderating role of earnings management on the relationship between CSR and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical study used the updated data set (3,481 unbalanced observations for period 2009â€“2015) from Chinese listed companies on Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges. The generalized method of moments (GMM) statistical approach has been used for the analysis. The authors utilized STATA to test GMM on a sample of Chinese listed firms data over the period 2009â€“2015. The unbalanced sample obtained 3,481 observations from China stock market and accounting research database and CSR ratings provided by Rankins (RKS). Findings: The results demonstrated that CSR has a positive and significant relationship with firmâ€™s performance; also, earnings management has a negatively moderate relationship between CSR and firm performance. These results imply that a high value of earnings management, which results in high level of symbolic CSR, converts to low firm performance of the Chinese firms. CSR actions (only as symbolic measures) promoted by managers as a means to cover their profit management incite an adverse effect on the companyâ€™s performance. This study has highlighted the impact of two different corporate social responsibilities: substantive and symbolic (genuine CSR vs greenwashing) on firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The results of this investigation will be of distinct interest to company owners who wish to ascertain the effectiveness of the sustainability decisions of directors and managers, and also to investors and public authorities to estimate the positive relationship between CSR and companyâ€™s reputation and image, and thus, the positive influence on firm performance. Originality/value: Previous studies have generally focused on the relationship between CSR and firm performance. This study provides the impact of earnings management (measurement of both aspects of accrual-based earnings management and real earnings management) on this relationship. Furthermore, this study examines the state of CSR in the Chinese market and provides empirical evidence of this relationship in emerging markets."
"Carbon Nanomaterial-Based Adsorbents for Water Protection Adsorbents; Graphene Oxide; Adsorption The pollution of water resources with different inorganic and organic pollutants and deterioration of drinkable water quality is pressing the need for the introduction of new and advanced material for water treatment technology. Nanomaterials are being very popular in water purification technology because of their excellent removal efficiency for a vast spectrum of pollutants via the adsorption process. Nowadays, carbon nanomaterials (carbon nanofiber, carbon nanotube, graphene, and its derivatives, etc.) have attracted great attention as adsorbents because of their extraordinary physicochemical properties for water treatment. This chapter explores the adsorption performance of carbon nanotube, carbon nanofiber, graphene, and its derivatives, etc., for organic dye, heavy metal, and pharmaceutical pollutants. It starts with the fundamental of the adsorption mechanism and isotherms. The chapter describes all the details on material from the synthesis process to the application and concisely states that adsorption performance can be improved by functionalization and modification of the pristine material. The current hurdle and prospects of the carbon nanomaterial also have been discussed. This chapter will contribute to a proper understanding of the implementation of carbon nanomaterials in the field of adsorption for environmental remediation and designing future experiments for water treatment."
"On the Feasibility of Machine Learning Models for Customer Spending Prediction Problem Customer Churn; Sales; Customer Relationship Management Over the last few years, FinTech (Financial Technology) companies have played a significant role in supporting e-commerce processes and transactions. For individual users, more convenient payment methods were invented to help them purchase more easily. For businesses, itâ€™s now a lot easier to understand customers than ever, especially in knowing how they spend their money. In fact, the capability of predicting customer spending power over a period of time is a crucial task for marketers in making strategic decisions about advertising. However, it is not trivial to build such an automatic prediction system due to the numerous models and metrics available combined with the ad-hoc nature of personal purchases. In this paper, as the first step in tackling the above-mentioned problem, we explored the feasibility of applying different machine learning models and metrics to predict customer spending under different contexts. In particular, we applied Beta Geometric/Negative Binomial distribution (BG/NBD), Gamma-gamma, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to train and predict customer spending. Experimenting with anonymized real-world data supplied by one of the biggest payment providers in Vietnam provided us with valuable insights into the suitability of each model. The result of this research can serve as a foundation for more in-depth work on the same problem in the future."
"Comparing Australian garment and childcare homeworkers’ experience of regulation and representation ILO; Personnel; Right to Strike Labour markets in Australia have long been segmented by gender and race. This study compares two highly gendered and racially segmented labour markets, home-based family day care workers and garment homeworkers. The comparative cases examine the broader trends of migration, production and consumption that reinforce gender and racial stereotypes, and discourses that underpin representations that women workers are ideally suited to such work. We theorise the gender and racialised inequalities of homework based on the literature on invisibilisation and social reproduction to explore the vulnerable position of migrant women and the consequences of having limited options, such as legal and social protections and any capacity to collectively organise. Our analysis examines the roles and responses of institutions and conceptualises the socio-political factors that affect the characterisation of homework as non-work or as self-employed entrepreneurial activities. By mapping the differing regulatory trajectories of these two groups of homeworkers in terms of regulation and representation, we find both similarities and differences. While garment homeworkers have achieved recognition through legislation and social mobilisation, their circumstances leave them less likely to access such rights. By contrast, the failure to recognise family day care homeworkers, has left them to market forces. JEL code: J01."
"Designing with nature-based solutions to mitigate flooding in mataniko river catchment, honiara Flood Damage; Flooding; Natural Hazards With increasing population and pressure on land resources in the wake of climate change in Oceanic Cities, working locally with ecosystems through nature-based solutions can be a practical approach towards resilient landscapes. Extreme weather conditions and rainfall events as inevitable consequences of the future change require landscape designers to stay abreast of technology in hydrology and hydraulic modelling. This paper illustrates experimental landscape interventions to redesign topographic configurations in Adobe Photoshop that offers unlimited opportunities for developing scenarios for flood mitigation. Through the coupling of GIS with a program that models the hydraulics of water flow, a method to familiarise designers with flood impacts using an iterative and scientifically informed design process is proposed. We conclude through the proposed workflow that the application of nature-based solutions was effective in reducing the water depth in flood events by 6.67 meters in vulnerable areas of the catchment occupied by informal settlements."
"Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design Urban Biodiversity; Urbanization; Birds Cities are increasingly considered important places for biodiversity conservation because they can harbor threatened species and because conservation in cities represents an opportunity to reconnect people with nature and the range of health and well-being benefits it provides. However, urbanization can be catastrophic for native species, and is a well-known threat to biodiversity worldwide. Urbanization impacts can be mitigated by urban design and development improvements, but take-up of these practices has been slow. There is an urgent need to incorporate existing ecological knowledge into a framework that can be used by planners and developers to ensure that biodiversity conservation is considered in decision-making processes. Here, we distill the urban biodiversity literature into five principles for biodiversity sensitive urban design (BSUD), ranging from creating habitat and promoting dispersal to facilitating community stewardship. We then present a framework for implementing BSUD aimed at delivering onsite benefits to biodiversity, and that is applicable across a range of urban development types and densities. We illustrate the application of the BSUD framework in two case studies focusing on the: (1) protection of an endangered vegetation remnant in a new low-density subdivision; and (2) persistence of an endangered reptile in an established suburban environment."

"Challenges and opportunities of the fourth revolution: a brief insight into the future of food Fog Computing; Network Protocol; Internet of Things By 2050, the global population is projected to be in excess of nine billion people. This will result in an increased burden and stress on the food production systems, particularly in adjustments to several stages of the value chain that will require improvements and/or modifications in their effectiveness such as reducing waste, adapting to climate change, food security, and health. Disruptions such as digital agriculture, digital food, food agility, big data, have been utilized to characterize the changes in the way agro-food systems evolve and function, as well as in the approach they have been analyzed, measured, and monitored. It has been long recognized that the food industry is considered as a data driven enterprise. These characteristics are very important as the food industry becomes global and sustainable. The food industry is currently undergoing significant changes, and with this, challenges are occurring. These challenges are brought about from the food chains, climate changes, and the ability to be resilient in the production of food. Furthermore, health and cultural changes to food are occurring, where the diseases of obesity, diabetes, and aging in the population will continue to change the consumerâ€™s patterns and choices; whereby the consumer will be persuaded to choose and eat healthy and more nutritious foods. Indeed, the cultural awareness and social innovation to prevent food waste and therefore improve food security and sustainability will also prove to further complexities. This short review will briefly discuss some of the forefront issues in food value chains with a focus on using technology."
"Female warriors: a reproduction of patriarchal narrative of Hua Mulan in The Red Detachment of Women (1972) China; Mao Zedong; Socialist During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the CCP officially claimed that Chinese women achieved an equal position as men, and the Confucian patriarchal family was deconstructed. This article is an ongoing exploration of Maoist gender discourse by analysing the image of female warriors in the revolutionary opera film, The Red Detachment of Women (1972) which was made and popularised during the Cultural Revolution. This article finds that Maoist gender discourse failed to deconstruct the Confucian patriarchy. The image of female warriors in the revolutionary opera films was a reproduction of the patriarchal narrative of Hua Mulan, which served an ethical symbol of loyalty and filial daughter in the discourse of Confucian patriarchy. Similar to Mulan, the masculinised image of female warriors in the revolutionary opera films cannot be identified as a feminist representation yet a cultural and ethical symbol of filial daughter that leads to womenâ€™s subordination to menâ€™s needs."
"Nonlinear vibration and geometric optimization of nanocomposite multilayer organic solar cell under wind loading Aerodynamics; Supersonic Flow; Hamilton's Principle This paper presents an analytical approach on the nonlinear vibration of nanocomposite multilayer organic solar cell (NMOSC) subjected to the combination of wind load and uniform temperature change. The NMOSC comprises of five layers, which are made of Al, P3HT:PCBM, PEDOT:PSS, Graphene and Glass. Compared to common models of the NMOSC, ITO is replaced by graphene to control the output colors of NMOSC. The nonlinear motion equations and the compatibility equation are deriving by taking into account the effect of viscous damping, von Karman nonlinearity terms, elastic foundations and initial imperfection. The formula of the wind load is improved for consideration in the general case that the direction of the wind load is not just perpendicular to the structure. Four edges of the NMOSC are assumed to be simply supported and immovable in the transverse plane. The Galerkin and Runge â€“ Kutta methods are applied to obtain the dynamic response and the natural frequency of the NMOSC. Four optimization algorithms (Bees Algorithm, Basic differential evolution algorithm, enhanced colliding bodies optimization algorithm, social group optimization algorithm) are used to determine the maximum value of natural frequency of the NMOCS, which depends on nine variables including the geometrical parameters, elastic foundations stiffness and temperature increment. In the numerical results, the effects of elastic foundations, initial imperfection, viscous damping ratio, temperature increment, wind load and the length to width ratio on the dynamic response and natural frequency are considered in details. The maximum values of the natural frequency of the NMOSC with four algorithms are obtained and compared. The results show that the optimal value obtained by four algorithms is close to each other. However, the calculation time with enhanced colliding bodies optimization algorithm is the fastest and with Bees Algorithm is the longest of all."
"The impact of urban greening transformations on health, liveability and connection to nature in disadvantaged communities Access and proximity to nature are critical determinants of health and wellbeing in contemporary cities adapting to climate change and recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Greater amounts and functionality of urban green spaces mitigate climate change effects and provide a wide range of environmental benefits that reduce urban heating and enhance human health and wellbeing. However,
inequity, disadvantage and diversity are rarely considered in urban greening research and policy. This study will scale-up and build on our previous research to understand the impact and benefits of naturalisation and transformation of the Upper Stony Creek (2017-2020) in Sunshine North, a socioeconomically disadvantaged area in Melbourne’s west. This project will combine quantitative and qualitative methods, including interviews with residents to understand their perspectives of the benefits provided by urban greening, and the impact of greening on their physical and mental health, wellbeing and connection to nature. Combined with neighbourhood level urban greening and environmental indicators using remote sensing technology, the project will develop new, scaled-up, accessible evidence of the
distribution and quality of greenspace and the adaptation capacity of communities to climate change. Indicators will include vegetation and impervious land cover, rooftop solar and roofing types to identify areas of environmental and sustainability inequity across Victoria, including Melbourne’s west.

"Evaluating the effect of change in the built environment on mental health and subjective well-being: A natural experiment Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Background Neighbourhood characteristics may affect mental health and well-being, but longitudinal evidence is limited. We examined the effect of relocating to East Village (the former London 2012 Olympic Athletes' Village), repurposed to encourage healthy active living, on mental health and well-being. Methods 1278 adults seeking different housing tenures in East village were recruited and examined during 2013-2015. 877 (69%) were followed-up after 2years; 50% had moved to East Village. Analysis examined change in objective measures of the built environment, neighbourhood perceptions (scored from low to high; quality-12 to 12, safety-10 to 10 units), self-reported mental health (depression and anxiety) and well-being (life satisfaction, life being worthwhile and happiness) among East Village participants compared with controls who did not move to East Village. Follow-up measures were regressed on baseline for each outcome with group status as a binary variable, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, housing tenure and household clustering (random effect). Results Participants who moved to East Village lived closer to their nearest park (528 m, 95% CI 482 to 575 m), in more walkable areas, and had better access to public transport, compared with controls. Living in East Village was associated with marked improvements in neighbourhood perceptions (quality 5.0, 95% CI 4.5 to 5.4 units; safety 3.4, 95% CI 2.9 to 3.9 units), but there was no overall effect on mental health and well-being outcomes. Conclusion Despite large improvements in the built environment, there was no evidence that moving to East Village improved mental health and well-being. Changes in the built environment alone are insufficient to improve mental health and well-being."
"Nano-plastics and their analytical characterisation and fate in the marine environment: From source to sea Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Polymer contamination is a major pollutant in all waterways and a significant concern of the 21st Century, gaining extensive research, media, and public attention. The polymer pollution problem is so vast; plastics are now observed in some of the Earth's most remote regions such as the Mariana trench. These polymers enter the waterways, migrate, breakdown; albeit slowly, and then interact with the environment and the surrounding biodiversity. It is these biodiversity and ecosystem interactions that are causing the most nervousness, where health researchers have demonstrated that plastics have entered the human food chain, also showing that plastics are damaging organisms, animals, and plants. Many researchers have focused on reviewing the macro and micro-forms of these polymer contaminants, demonstrating a lack of scientific data and also a lack of investigation regarding nano-sized polymers. It is these nano-polymers that have the greatest potential to cause the most harm to our oceans, waterways, and wildlife. This review has been especially ruthless in discussing nano-sized polymers, their ability to interact with organisms, and the potential for these nano-polymers to cause environmental damage in the marine environment. This review details the breakdown of macro-, micro-, and nano-polymer contamination, examining the sources, the interactions, and the fates of all of these polymer sizes in the environment. The main focus of this review is to perform a comprehensive examination of the literature of the interaction of nanoplastics with organisms, soils, and waters; followed by the discussion of toxicological issues. A significant focus of the review is also on current analytical characterisation techniques for nanoplastics, which will enable researchers to develop protocols for nanopolymer analysis and enhance understanding of nanoplastics in the marine environment."
"Multiple vulnerabilities – examining the fuel and food poverty nexus In concert with the Housing Energy Efficiency Transitions project at RMIT University (HEET), a multinational project examining the upscaling of energy retrofits in low-income areas across multiple cities in Australia and UK, the aim of this project is to embed the concept of multiple vulnerabilities in research on fuel poverty and energy efficiency. The capabilities approach informs the analysis of the data from the HEET project and the inclusion of the concept of multiple vulnerabilities is seen as an important contribution taking energy research into a new direction."
"Understanding the Experiences of Vietnamese Women Leaders: Advancing an Existential Philosophical and Psychological Perspective Vietnam; Intimate Partner Violence; Sexual Health The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the value(s) of existential philosophy and psychology for understanding womenâ€™s lives in a cross-cultural context. It focuses on Vietnamese women and the formation of their self-identity in the process of becoming a leader. Theoretically, we draw on the existential philosophy of Martin Heideggerâ€™s fundamental ontology that emphasizes being, temporality and context (thrownness), Simone de Beauvoirâ€™s account of gender and other pertinent existentialists. To illustrate the value of an existential perspective, we offer an empirical example of a Vietnamese womanâ€™s life-story (who was chosen because she is a leader), interpreting her self-identity as it unfolds over the life span. This approach has the potential to capture an individualsâ€™ diverse and complex modes of being, how they take part in shaping their reality through their situatedness in the world. The value of existentialism lies in its view of self-identity as a process of becoming, as opposed to a fixed and stable entity, providing the means for theorizing the possibilities for female agency, which addresses one of the limitations of the existing research on womenâ€™s leadership in Vietnam. Our analysis of the participantâ€™s life-story offers a case illustration of her encounters with the conditions of existence, which serve as important events, milestones, and turning points that promote a critical reflection on the role that culture, choice, and meaning plays in her life and leadership."

"The co-application of biochar with bioremediation for the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from contaminated soil Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Soil pollution from petroleum hydrocarbon is a global environmental problem that could contribute to the non-actualisation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Several techniques have been used to remediate petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soils; however, there are technical and economical limitations to existing methods. As such, the development of new approaches and the improvement of existing techniques are imperative. Biochar, a low-cost carbonaceous product of the thermal decomposition of waste biomass has gained relevance in soil remediation. Biochar has been applied to remediate hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, with positive and negative results reported. Consequently, attempts have been made to improve the performance of biochar in the hydrocarbon-based remediation process through the co-application of biochar with other bioremediation techniques as well as modifying biochar properties before use. Despite the progress made in this domain, there is a lack of a detailed single review consolidating the critical findings, new developments, and challenges in biochar-based remediation of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soil. This review assessed the potential of biochar co-application with other well-known bioremediation techniques such as bioaugmentation, phytoremediation, and biostimulation. Additionally, the benefits of modification in enhancing biochar suitability for bioremediation were examined. It was concluded that biochar co-application generally resulted in higher hydrocarbon removal than sole biochar treatment, with up to a 4-fold higher removal observed in some cases. However, most of the biochar co-applied treatments did not result in hydrocarbon removal that was greater than the additive effects of individual treatment. Overall, compared to their complementary treatments, biochar co-application with bioaugmentation was more beneficial in hydrocarbon removal than biochar co-application with either phytoremediation or biostimulation. Future studies should integrate the ecotoxicological and cost implications of biochar co-application for a viable remediation process. Lastly, improving the synergistic interactions of co-treatment on hydrocarbon removal is critical to capturing the full potential of biochar-based remediation."
"What are the impacts of living in social housing? New evidence from Australia Neighborhood Effects; Public Housing; Poverty In this paper, we apply statistical matching methods to a national longitudinal dataset of Australians facing housing insecurity to estimate the impacts of social housing on employment, education, health, incarceration and homelessness. We find social housing in Australia provides an important `safety netâ€™ protecting people from homelessness. However, at least in the short run, individuals in social housing have similar outcomes in terms of employment, education, physical and mental health, and incarceration to other comparable individuals not in social housing. These are the first estimates of causal impacts of social housing, simultaneously estimating impacts on a range of shelter and non-shelter outcomes highlighted as important by the broader social housing literature. They also provide an interesting contrast with the existing US estimates. These results are potentially due to strict targeting of individuals into social housing and that they represent the average effect across individuals who may experience substantially different impacts."
"Transport disadvantage, social exclusion, and subjective well-being: The role of the neighborhood environment—evidence from Sydney, Australia Public Transport; Accessibility; Transit This study explores the effects of the neighborhood environment on transport disadvantage, social exclusion, personal health and subjective well-being (SWB) using survey data collected in Sydney, Australia. The data is analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM). Overall, our model supports the hypothesis that a walkable neighborhood environment helps to reduce transport disadvantage and increase social inclusion. Neighborhood density has negative effects on both physical and mental health, but a positive effect on SWB. Further, a cohesive neighborhood environment is associated with less transport disadvantage, more engagement in political and civic activities, more social help, better mental health and higher SWB. By contrast, perception of crime in a neighborhood is associated with more transport disadvantage and worse physical health. Neighborhood aesthetics and the neighborhood social environment have stronger effects on SWB than other neighborhood environment characteristics."
"Influence of turbulence modeling on combustor flowfield in scramjet mode of rbcc engine Cavity; Supersonic Combustion; Rocket-based Combined-cycle Engines Rocket-based Combined-Cycle (RBCC) engines offer promise for efficient and flexible propulsion for space transportation over a wide Mach number range by combining rocket and airbreathing propulsion technologies. To achieve this an RBCC engine uses four different modes of operation, i.e., ejector, ramjet, scramjet and rocket modes, during the ascent phase. The engine must thus make effective transition from subsonic to supersonic combustion, i.e., ramjet to scramjet mode during operation. The study is conducted to investigate the effects of turbulence modeling on the simulation of the RBCC combustor flowfield and the prediction of the combustor performance in the scramjet mode. A two-dimensional RBCC configuration has been considered numerically, using hydrogen as the fuel supplied through injectors at the divergent top wall and horizontal floor. Combustion has been found to occur predominantly near the top injector and along the shear layer downstream, with its extent being considerably sensitive to the choice of turbulent Schmidt number and turbulence model. The performance of the combustor crucially depends on these attributes subsequently due to complex flow phenomena and interactions as well as counteracting behavior of pressure and viscous forces."

"Transcriptome profiling of lentil (Lens culinaris) through the first 24 hours of Ascochyta lentis infection reveals key defence response genes Genetic Variability; Ascochyta Lentis; Breeding Programs Background: Ascochyta blight, caused by the fungus Ascochyta lentis, is one of the most destructive lentil diseases worldwide, resulting in over $16 million AUD annual loss in Australia alone. The use of resistant cultivars is currently considered the most effective and environmentally sustainable strategy to control this disease. However, little is known about the genes and molecular mechanisms underlying lentil resistance against A. lentis. Results: To uncover the genetic basis of lentil resistance to A. lentis, differentially expressed genes were profiled in lentil plants during the early stages of A. lentis infection. The resistant 'ILL7537' and susceptible 'ILL6002' lentil genotypes were examined at 2, 6, and 24 h post inoculation utilising high throughput RNA-Sequencing. Genotype and time-dependent differential expression analysis identified genes which play key roles in several functions of the defence response: fungal elicitors recognition and early signalling; structural response; biochemical response; transcription regulators; hypersensitive reaction and cell death; and systemic acquired resistance. Overall, the resistant genotype displayed an earlier and faster detection and signalling response to the A. lentis infection and demonstrated higher expression levels of structural defence-related genes. Conclusions: This study presents a first-time defence-related transcriptome of lentil to A. lentis, including a comprehensive characterisation of the molecular mechanism through which defence against A. lentis is induced in the resistant lentil genotype."
"Code-switching Identities: curating networked presence Non-binary gender identities pose a problem for international provision of education, health services and citizenship, and yet gender-diverse stories proliferate in a multitude of online spaces and are increasingly visible in mainstream media. Could the co-incidence of new ‘beyond-dualistic’ ways of being neither wholly male/female and online/offline, spell an end to finite and binary ways of being and doing gender? 

This project examines the intersections between emergent gender categories and fluid, multiple digital identities. It engages discrete groups of young gender-diverse people, their parents, educators, health providers and policy makers, in short creative workshops, where they each produce a pseudonymous, ‘ungendered’ selfie. These fragments of self will be curated in an online archive/website and exhibition at RMIT. Their images and reflections will be used as prompts at a Symposium in which we unpack the many ways we may like to be categorised and archived in more formal institutions of governance, education and citizenship.

"The role of ghrelin in the neurobehavioural consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects ~12% of Australians, with a greater prevalence in women than men1. Emerging research has indicated a stomach-derived hormone, ghrelin, plays a key role in driving the memory disruption symptoms of stress induced PTSD2, 3. However, ghrelin's role in the depression, anhedonia and disruption to reward pathways that also occur with PTSD is unknown.
I hypothesise that exposure to chronic stress results in prolonged elevation of ghrelin and this long-term dysregulation of ghrelin contributes to the depressive-like symptomology of PTSD. I also hypothesise that limiting the action of ghrelin can improve the neurobehavioural consequences of PTSD and thus alleviate the burden of this debilitating mental illness."
"Counting the Costs of Public Housing Estate Redevelopment in Melbourne: A comparison of delivery options Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Since 2001, social housing levels, traditionally a safety net for low-income households, have stagnated in Victoria. To increase social housing levels, the Victorian state government announced a programme to redevelop ageing public housing estates through publicâ€“private partnerships. This study compares private sector, community housing sector, and government-led redevelopment models, to determine which provides the best value for money method of redevelopment. Importantly, considering the Victorian governmentâ€™s plans to increase social housing levels post-COVID19, the study found that the government is best placed to deliver social housing, due, in part, to lower borrowing costs and no requirement for making profit."
"Inspiring Future- Oriented Graduates with Innovative Curriculum Design: Accounting in the Digital Age (Administered by University of Western Australia) Technology is rapidly evolving, changing and challenging how business is being run and the way accounting profession must deal with the technological advancements. The technology advancements have led the 21st century to be referred to as ""the digital age"" (Birt et al. 2017).

"“They are grinding us into the ground” – The lived experience of (in)energy justice amongst low-income older households Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort This article contributes to the literature on energy justice by revealing how the principles of energy (in)justice manifest at the domestic scale. We use data from a retrofit intervention trial to reveal recognised and hidden vulnerabilities and practiced distributive and procedural energy fairness in the lived experiences of low-income older and/or frail householders near Melbourne, Australia. Combining the capability and practice approach for the transition to lower carbon housing to provide a rich description, we chart householder functionings of heating and paying energy bills and their choices in keeping warm and affording energy before and after simple retrofits. Energy justice was experienced on four separately distinguishable levels of social relationships: intra-households, household-energy retailer relations, immediate social networks and wider social relations. The outcomes of the trial showed that combinations of simple retrofits improved householder heating capabilities. Policies and programs aimed at transitioning to low-carbon energy systems need to acknowledge and address the changing demand for energy of an ageing population, and acknowledge social differentiation within households. This includes using a capabilities approach to recognising multiple vulnerabilities."
"A multicriteria analysis approach for evaluating the performance of agriculture decision support systems for sustainable agribusiness Farmers Knowledge; Decision Support Systems; Decision Making Agriculture decision support systems (DSSs) play an important role in facilitating evidenceâ€based agricultural decisionâ€making for improving agribusiness productivity. Evaluating and selecting the most appropriate agriculture DSS for sustainable agribusiness is, however, challenging due to the existence of production and marketing alternatives, a variety of objective functions from economic to lifestyle to longâ€term sustainability, and the subjectiveness and imprecision involved in the evaluation process. To help decision makers effectively deal with these issues, this paper presents a multicriteria analysis approach for evaluating and selecting the most appropriate agriculture DSS for sustainable agribusiness. The subjective assessments of decision makers in the evaluation process are formulated using linguistic variables approximated by fuzzy numbers. The concept based on the positive and the negative ideal solutions is applied for producing a performance index value for every agriculture DSS alternative across all evaluation criteria based on which the most appropriate agriculture DSS is. An empirical study is presented for demonstrating the stepâ€wise process for evaluating and selecting the most appropriate agriculture DSS for sustainable agribusiness. The outcome from the performance evaluation process allows agribusinesses to effectively adopt appropriate agriculture DSSs for achieving competitive advantages."
"Microplastic contamination has limited effects on coral fertilisation and larvae Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Microplastics are ubiquitous throughout the world's oceans and contaminate coral reef ecosystems. There is evidence of microplastic ingestion by corals and passive contact with coral tissues, causing adverse health effects that include energy expenditure for particle removal from the tissue surface, as well as reduced growth, tissue bleaching, and necrosis. Here, it was examined whether microplastic contamination impairs the success of gamete fertilisation, embryo development and larval settlement of the reef-building coral Acropora tenuis. Coral gametes and larvae were exposed to fifteen microplastic treatments using two types of plastic: (1) weathered polypropylene particles and (2) spherical polyethylene microbeads. The treatments ranged from five to 50 polypropylene pieces L-1 and 25 to 200 microbeads L-1. Fertilisation was only negatively affected by the largest weathered microplastics (2 mm2), but the effects were not dose dependent. Embryo development and larval settlement were not significantly impacted by either microplastic type. The study shows that moderate-high levels of marine microplastic contamination, specifically particles <2 mm2, will not substantially interfere with the success of critical early life coral processes."

"Impact of microalgae species and solution salinity on algal treatment of wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Six common microalgal species, including freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus abundans, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Coelastrum microporum, and marine microalgae Nannochloropsis salina and Dunaliella tertiolecta, were tested in batch treatment to identify the most promising species for remediating a municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC). Selected species were then studied at different ROC salinity levels (5, 10, and 15 g TDS/L) in semi-continuous treatment to evaluate their potential for nutrient remediation, and biogas production through anaerobic digestion. S. abundans, C. vulgaris, and N. salina showed higher potential for growth and nutrient remediation under salinity stress. Further tests revealed that N. salina adapted well to ROC conditions, and S. abundans could grow better and had higher tolerance to the elevated salinity than C. vulgaris. S. abundans and N. salina performed better for removing nutrients and organic matter (11.5â€“18 mg/L/d TN, 7.1â€“8.2 mg/L/d TP, and 8.6â€“12.4 mg/L/d DOC). Increasing salinity led to growth inhibition and N uptake reduction for freshwater species but had no significant effect on TP removal. Biochemical methane potential tests showed the algal biomass produced a significant amount of methane (e.g., up to 422 mL CH4/g VS for N. salina), suggesting the algae generated from the ROC treatment could produce significant amounts of energy through anaerobic digestion without the need for pretreatment. This study showed the environmental and economic potential of the algal system for future applications."
"Liquid-Metal-Enabled Mechanical-Energy-Induced CO2 Conversion Carbon Dioxide; Electrocatalysts; Chemical Reduction A green carbon capture and conversion technology offering scalability and economic viability for mitigating CO2 emissions is reported. The technology uses suspensions of gallium liquid metal to reduce CO2 into carbonaceous solid products and O2 at near room temperature. The nonpolar nature of the liquid gallium interface allows the solid products to instantaneously exfoliate, hence keeping active sites accessible. The solid co-contributor of silverâ€“gallium rods ensures a cyclic sustainable process. The overall process relies on mechanical energy as the input, which drives nano-dimensional triboelectrochemical reactions. When a gallium/silver fluoride mix at 7:1 mass ratio is employed to create the reaction material, 92% efficiency is obtained at a remarkably low input energy of 230 kWh (excluding the energy used for dissolving CO2) for the capture and conversion of a tonne of CO2. This green technology presents an economical solution for CO2 emissions."
"Carbon sequestration value of biosolids applied to soil: A global meta-analysis Soil Organic Carbon; China; Carbon Sinks Biosolids produced at wastewater treatment facilities are extensively used in agricultural land and degraded mine sites to improve soil health and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Many studies have reported increases in SOC due to application of biosolids to such sites. However, lack of a comprehensive quantification on overall trends and changes of magnitude in SOC remains. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to identify drivers with a relationship with SOC stocks. A meta-regression of 297 treatments found four variables with a relationship with SOC stocks: cumulative biosolids carbon (C) input rate, time after application, soil depth and type of biosolids. The cumulative biosolids C input rate was the most influencing driver. The highest mean difference for SOC% of 3.3 was observed at 0â€“15 cm soil depth for a cumulative C input of 100 Mg haâˆ’1 at one year after biosolids application. Although years after biosolids application demonstrated a negative relationship with SOC stocks, mineralization of C in biosolids-applied soils is slow, as indicated with the SOC% decrease from 4.6 to 2.8 at 0â€“15 cm soil depth over five years of 100 Mg haâˆ’1 biosolids C input. Soil depth illustrated a strong negative effect with SOC stocks decreasing by 2.7% at 0â€“15 cm soil depth at a cumulative biosolids C input of 100 Mg haâˆ’1 over a year. Overall, our model estimated an effect of 2.8 SOC% change, indicating the application of biosolids as a viable strategy for soil C sequestration on a global scale."
"Conceptualisation for mobile commerce adoption in SMEs: a perspective of developing countries E-Commerce Adoption; Top Management Support; Electronic Commerce This paper presents a comprehensive review of the related literature on organisational mobile commerce (m-commerce) adoption with the use of an iterative methodology for reviewing, analysing and critically assessing the related literature. Such a review leads to the development of a conceptual framework for a best-fit explanation on the critical determinants of m-commerce adoption in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the context of developing countries. Such a framework can overcome the limitations encountered in the previous organisational m-commerce adoption research. It sheds light on four important groups of factors for better understanding the critical determinants for organisational m-commerce adoption, namely technological factors, organisational factors, environmental factors, and managerial factors. The study contributes to organisational m-commerce adoption research by extending previous works on organisational m-commerce adoption with the development of a comprehensive conceptual model from the perspective of developing countries for better exploring the critical determinants of m-commerce adoption in SMEs."

"Human-made corals for marine habitats: Design optimization and additive manufacturing Boron Isotopes; Coral; Coralline Alga This paper presents an optimization method to systematically design human-made corals using the technique of solid isotropic material with the penalization. In optimization, we minimized the squared norm of the carbon gradient and considered the volume constraint and the length constraint. We homogeneously dented optimization results using a surface mapping method to provide shelters for polyps, which widely exist in natural corals like the anthocyanins. A computational fluid dynamics investigation based on the lattice Boltzmann method illustrated that the branches of the optimized configuration could shield polyps from ocean currents and afford sufficient nutrition. Eventually, we prototyped samples by digital light processing printer with an optimum mixture ratio of biologically compatible calcium carbonate and photosensitive material. Examples show the tropism of marine organisms in human-made corals is akin to the natural ones. The proposed method allows designing human-made corals and is crucial for environmental remediation."

"Increase in concentration ratio of a rooftop parabolic trough using a secondary flat reflector Parabolic; Solar Power Plants; Solar Thermal Energy Secondary stage optics are an option to increase parabolic trough concentrators to enhance thermal efficiency. Increases of concentration up to 80 % were stated as possible with a flat secondary reflector in past work. In this work, a prototype of secondary flat reflector receiver was built and experimentally tested at RMIT's facilities in Melbourne, and its performance was compared with a conventional absorber. The facility includes a closed loop hydraulic circuit to recirculate a heat transfer fluid which temperature is controlled by an external heater and a cooling system. In the case of the roof-top collector studied in this work, the use of a secondary flat reflector increased its concentration by 19.7 % while decreasing the incoming radiation by 3.5 % due to the shadow formed. In this work it is demonstrated how a smaller absorber can be used while maintaining the acceptance angle of the collector and increasing the uniformity of the flux, thus reducing the thermal stress on the absorber. Additionally, a better tolerance to misalignments and optical aberrations is achieved with the flat secondary reflector, as it was proven during the experiments. Finally, the experimental results were compared with a 2D CFD model."
"Direct and indirect impact assessment in off-site construction—A case study in China Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Off-site construction is a popular construction technique due to improvements in construction time and efficiency. However, a typical construction will incur several air emission substances which can be categorised as direct and indirect emissions. The effect of these pollutant substances may have severe health impacts on the immediate surrounding environment of the construction site. The study attempts to quantify direct and indirect emissions associated with off-site construction and compare with traditional on-site construction. Two case studies in Chengdu, China is used to investigate the direct and indirect impacts of off-site construction as compared to conventional construction. The results indicate GHG emissions reduction of 8.40% for off-site construction. Impact assessment revealed pre-fabrication having more reduction on global warming and oxidation formation at global level and eutrophication, human toxicity and acidification at regional and local environment. Further analysis revealed a strong relationship between the transportation distance and the level of pre-fabrication on total carbon emission reduction. The methodology provided in the current study exemplified the importance of conducting a well-articulated assessment to help decision making on environmental impact reduction in off-site construction. The results conclude the importance of developing a structured decision making platform to assist the sustainable decision makings in future."

"Long-term effects of sewage sludge–derived biochar on the accumulation and availability of trace elements in a tropical soil Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Thermal treatment by pyrolysis has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to enable the agricultural use of sewage sludge. The solid product obtained via pyrolysis of sewage sludge is called sewage sludge biochar and presents several advantages for its use as a fertilizer or soil conditioner. However, there are concerns about the accumulation and dynamics of trace elements in soil amended with sewage sludge biochar over the years. This study examined the effect of sewage sludge biochar, under field conditions for 5 yr, on the accumulation and availability of trace elements in a tropical soil. For this, 15 t haâ€“1 of sewage sludge biochar produced at 300 and 500 Â°C were applied in the first two growing seasons. Application was interrupted from the third to the fifth seasons to assess the residual effect of sewage sludge biochar in the soil. The total and available trace element concentrations were determined. The total contents of trace elements showed the following variation in the soil over the 5 yr (mg kgâ€“1): Cd (16.8â€“20.0), Co (19.5â€“21.5), Cr (98.2â€“125.7), Cu (8.1â€“17.1), Mn (62.9â€“85.7), Ni (20.3â€“35.0), Pb (27.0â€“52.4), and Zn (20.3â€“35.8). There was no change in the availability of Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb over the years. Additionally, a residual effect of the sewage sludge biochar was the increase in availability of trace elements that are considered essential (Cu, Mn, and Zn) and beneficial elements (Co) for plants. Therefore, in relation to contamination by trace elements, the pyrolysis of sewage sludge of domestic origin proved to be an adequate strategy to enable the safe use of this residue in tropical agriculture."
"Environmental and anthropogenic influences on ambient background concentrations of fluoride in soil Fluorides; Pollution; Euphausia Superba Excess exposure to fluoride causes substantive health burden in humans and livestock globally. However, few studies have assessed the distribution and controls of variability of ambient background concentrations of fluoride in soil. Ambient background concentrations of fluoride in soil were collated for Greater Melbourne, Greater Geelong, Ballarat and Mitchell in Victoria, Australia (n = 1005). Correlation analysis and machine learning techniques were used to identify environmental and anthropogenic influences of fluoride variability in soil. Sub-soils (>0.3 m deep), in some areas overlying siltstone and sandstone, and to a lesser extent, overlying basalt, were naturally enriched with fluoride at concentrations above ecological thresholds for grazing animals. Soil fluoride enrichment was predominantly influenced by parent material (mineralogy), precipitation (illuviation), leaching during palaeoclimates and marine inputs. Industrial air pollution did not significantly influence ambient background concentrations of fluoride at a regional scale. However, agricultural practices (potentially the use of phosphate fertilisers) were indicated to have resulted in added fluoride to surface soils overlying sediments. Geospatial variables alone were not sufficient to accurately model ambient background soil fluoride concentrations. A multiple regression model based on soil chemistry and parent material was shown to accurately predict ambient background fluoride concentrations in soils and support assessment of fluoride enrichment in the environment. Few studies have assessed environmental/anthropogenic controls of background fluoride concentrations at a regional scale (e.g. not associated with a key point source of contamination). For the first time, a geochemical regression tree model for the estimation of ambient background fluoride concentrations in soil has been developed and is shown to have promise for application for predicting areas of fluoride enrichment/risk in soils."
"Energy poverty and retirement income sources in Australia Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort In many countries population ageing will increase the share of retirees in the coming years. Energy poverty is a particular problem for older people (due to fixed and often relatively low incomes and the need for additional energy due to underlying health conditions). This can have cost implications for the healthcare sector if the health of older people deteriorates due to energy poverty. The burden of population ageing and the increasing dependency ratio has meant the government is moving towards individuals funding their own retirement via compulsory superannuation schemes. Our study is based in Australia where there is a difference in retirement income sources between publicly funded Age Pensioners, Part-pensioners and Self-Funded Retirees leading to differences in energy poverty beyond income effects. Using 15 annual waves of the HILDA survey from 2005 to 2019, this study investigates drivers of energy poverty inequalities among retirees. Our main finding is that Age Pensioners are the worst off and Self-Funded Retirees the best off on a Low Incomeâ€“High Cost measure of energy poverty and on a subjective indicator of inability to heat the home. Therefore, not all retirees have the same probability of experiencing energy poverty. However, wealth, assets, social connections and good health are significant mediators that soften the impact of subjective concerns regarding energy bills for retirees. Government-funded pensions are a safety net and need to be sufficient in times of energy price inflation. Moreover, we need to reduce the gap between state-funded pensions and self-funding arrangements to ensure equity in elderly populations."
"Hybrid genetic algorithm fuzzy-based control schemes for small power system with high-penetration wind farms Electric Power System Interconnection; Frequency Control; Power System Wind is a clean, abundant, and inexhaustible source of energy. However, wind power is not constant, as windmill output is proportional to the cube of wind speed. As a result, the generated power of wind turbine generators (WTGs) fluctuates significantly. Power fluctuation leads to frequency deviation and voltage flicker inside the system. This paper presents a new methodology for controlling system frequency and power. Two decentralized fuzzy logic-based control schemes with a high-penetration non-storage wind-diesel system are studied. First, one is implemented in the governor of conventional generators to damp frequency oscillation, while the other is applied to control the pitch angle system of wind turbines to smooth wind output power fluctuations and enhance the power system performance. A genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to tune and optimize the membership function parameters of the fuzzy logic controllers to obtain optimal performance. The effectiveness of the suggested controllers is validated by time domain simulation for the standard IEEE nine-bus three-generator test system, including three wind farms. The robustness of the power system is checked under normal and faulty operating conditions."
"Challenges Inherent in Controlling Prickly Pear Species; a Global Review of the Properties of Opuntia stricta, Opuntia ficus-indica and Opuntia monacantha Dactylopius; Hemiptera; Cactaceae Opuntia species (prickly pear) were deliberately introduced to many countries around the world for fruit, cochineal dye production, living fencing or as ornamentals. They are now some of the worldâ€™s most significant weeds, particularly in regions with warm and or dry climates, as they pose threats to economic and environmental assets. In addition, they can cause considerable health issues for humans and animals. Opuntia spp. have prolific reproduction abilities, being able to reproduce both vegetatively and by seed. They have generalist pollination and dispersal requirements, which promotes their establishment and spread. Opuntia stricta, O. monacantha and O. ficus-indica are the most globally widespread of the Opuntia spp. In many countries, biological control agents, particularly the cactus moth (Cactoblastis cactorum) and various cochineal insects from the Dactylopius genus, have successfully reduced land-scape scale populations. On a smaller scale, controlling these weeds by either injecting or spraying the cladodes with herbicides can provide effective control. Care must be taken during herbicide treatments as any untreated areas will regenerate. While biological control is the most cost and time effective control method for landscape-scale infestations, further research into the combined efficacy of herbicides, fire, grubbing and pre-burial techniques would be beneficial for land managers to control small-scale and establishing populations. It would also be useful to have greater knowledge of the potential seedbank longevity and seed ecology of these species so that integrated management strategies can be developed to not only deal with initial populations but also the subsequent seedling regrowth."
"‘Two different worlds’: Papua New Guinean women working in development in Port Moresby Papua New Guinea; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Masculinity This article examines the lives of Port Moresby women who work in the development sector of Papua New Guinea. In particular, it demonstrates how development discourse structures the very fabric of working relationships within this sector in Port Moresby. Underpinned by neocolonial geographies in which those in the global north rescue those in the global south, these discourses produce workplaces in which Papua New Guinean women are seen as lacking the moral and technical capacities to run development projects in their own country. The article argues that the privileges held by expatriates and denied to local women, in conjunction with the workplace discrimination to which they are subjected, ironically undermine the development sector's supposed commitment to promoting gender equality in Papua New Guinea."

"Phytobiotic potential for control of Spotty Liver Disease Spotty Liver Disease (SLD) is causing significant problems in the Australian chicken egg production industry. SLD can result in hen mortality and reduces the output in hens that survive the disease. The industry needs options to treat and/or avoid the disease. It has been hypothesised that disruption of gut health, in particular the immune function of the gut, may predispose birds to SLD. Hence products that promote a healthy gut immune system may help to protect birds from SLD. National Feed Solutions Pty Ltd (NFS) has access to poultry feed additives from Phytobiotics GmbH that may promote gut health and immunity and be effective in reducing SLD in susceptible flocks. RMIT University, in collaboration with Scolexia Pty Ltd, have identified the bacterial pathogen that causes SLD and have developed a disease exposure model that allows the testing of potential SLD treatments in a controlled experimental setting. The SLD exposure model can be used to test the efficacy of the NFS/Phytobiotics additives in reducing the clinical impact of SLD."
"Developing Oil Vulnerability Index (VAMPIRE) from Australian Cities (Administered by University of Melbourne) RMIT is being asked to produce VAMPIRE indices for a research project that the University of Melbourne is running with funding from the Department of Education and Training and the Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change,Science, Research and Tertiary Education. The VAMPIRE index is developed using spatial modelling techniques. The VAMPIRE index is developed using spatial modelling techniques. Four input variables will be used in the model: (1) household weekly income; (2) proportion of households owning two or more vehicles; (3) proportion of people traveling to work by car; and (4) number of homes being purchased with a mortgage. The method of calculating the VAMPIRE index involves standard ranking and weighting procedures for both input variables, and the composite
VAMPIRE index will be calculated using the following equation:
VAMPIRE index = (proportion of households own two or more vehicles) + (proportion of people travel to work by car) + (household weekly income x 2) + (proportion of homes are being purchased with a mortgage x 2).
The VAMPIRE index will be produced at SA2 level covering the urban area of each of Australia's state capital city.

"Developing the resilient project professional: examining the student experience Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management Purpose: Resilience development during university can increase the likelihood of positive employment outcomes for project management graduates in what is known as a stressful profession where the prevalence of project failure, job insecurity, and burnout is high. However, a focus on student resilience in project management education is scarce. The purpose of this paper is to address this gap by establishing a baseline profile of resilience for project management students, identifying priority areas of resilience development and exploring the relationship between resilience and well-being. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 292 Australian students undertaking project management studies completed a survey comprising of the Resilience at University scale, the Short Warwickâ€“Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale and an item assessing sleep adequacy. Findings: A resilience profile for undergraduate, postgraduate, male and female project management students was calculated. The resilience profile identified differences according to gender, and between undergraduate and postgraduate students. Mental well-being and adequate sleep were found to be significantly related to resilience. Practical implications: Findings support the call for a greater emphasis on resilience development in the project management curriculum for undergraduates and postgraduates. One priority area likely to facilitate resilience is the ability to maintain perspective. As well as supporting academic achievement, it will assist graduates to navigate through complex, uncertain and challenging project environments. Originality/value: This is the first known study of resilience for students undertaking project management studies in higher education."
"Damping performance analysis and control of hybrid AC/multi-terminal DC power grids High Voltage Direct Current System; Offshore Wind Farms; Converter The voltage-source converter (VSC) based multi-terminal direct-current (MTDC) networks are currently being developed in large-scale power grids for efficient and economical transmission of electrical energy generated from remotely sited renewable energy sources (RESs). As the MTDC network is developed alongside the conventional AC grid, it has transformed the power grid to a hybrid AC/MTDC power network. However, since the MTDC network is controlled via the power electronic converters (PECs), it significantly affects the AC power grid damping and synchronising performance as it decouples the natural dynamics between various electro-mechanical systems in the power grid. This paper proposes a supplementary control scheme to improve the damping performance of the entire hybrid AC/MTDC power grid. The damping torque analysis (DTA) technique is used as the primary technique to develop the supplementary control scheme. The preliminary analysis is carried out using a two-terminal hybrid AC/DC power grid and has suggested a supplementary control loop based on the rotor speed deviation for the DC voltage controller of the VSC to improve the damping performance. With the state-space model, the synchronising and damping torque coefficients are calculated and accordingly, the feedback gain is determined to provide optimal synchronising and damping torque components. Subsequently, the fidelity of the supplementary controller is verified using a four-terminal hybrid AC/MTDC grid. Simulation studies prove that the proposed supplementary controller can improve the hybrid AC/MTDC network damping performance, and it performs very effectively with the master-slave control and the conventional droop control scheme."
"Case Study: Taiwan's pathway into a circular future for buildings Industrial Symbiosis; Sustainable Development; Circular Economy The aim of this paper is to explore successful paths and potential obstacles for introducing circular buildings to a region new to the strategy of Circular Economy (CE). For this, the process of circular buildings development in Taiwan is analysed. In 2016, the government of Taiwan passed an act that put a focus on CE. Taiwan entered this field with nearly no prior experience. This paper analyses three cases: The Holland Pavilion for the World Flora Expo Taichung; the TaiSugar Circular Village Tainan; and the CE Social Housing Taipei. Interestingly, Taiwan choose the Netherlands as a country for guidance on best practices and the path to implementation. Our analysis focuses on barriers and opportunities found in the initiation, commissioning, and the ongoing development process of these projects. Data is collected through interviews with 30 stakeholders, from government, industries and academia who are involved in the projects. International collaboration is shown to have speeded up the CE building innovation process in Taiwan."
"Kinetics, isotherms and adsorption–Desorption behavior of phosphorus from aqueous solution using zirconium–iron and iron modified biosolid biochars Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption Excessive discharge of phosphorus (P) to aquatic ecosystems can lead to unpleasant eutrophication phenomenon. Removal and recovery of P is challenging due to low C/N ratios in wastewater, hence the development of efficient removal and recovery of P strategies is essential. In this study, zirconiumâ€“iron (Zrâ€“FeBC) and iron modified (Feâ€“BC) biosolid biochars were examined to investigate their capacity for the removal of P by batch experiments. The influence of solution pH, biochar dose, initial P concentration, ionic strength, interfering ions and temperature were also studied to evaluate the P adsorption performance of biochars. The P experimental data were best described with pseudo-second order kinetics and the Freundlich isotherm model. The maximum P adsorption capacities were reached to 33.33 and 25.71 mg gâˆ’1 for 24 h by Zrâ€“FeBC and Fe-BC at pH 5 and 4, respectively. Desorption studies were performed to investigate the reusability, cost-effectiveness and stability of the adsorbents Zrâ€“FeBC and Fe-BC. The adsorptionâ€“desorption study suggests that both examined biochars have considerable potentiality as adsorbent candidates in removing as well as recovery of P from wastewaters. Results also reveal that the regenerated Zrâ€“FeBC and Feâ€“BC could be utilized repetitively in seven adsorptionâ€“desorption cycles using NaOH as a desorbing agent, which greatly reduces the P-removal cost from wastewaters. Thus, P enriched biochar could potentially be used as fertilizer in the agriculture sector."
"Enhancing resilience of critical road infrastructure: bridges, culverts and flood ways under natural hazards The overarching aim of the proposed second stage of the project is to work closely with key stakeholders to implement the methodologies that have been developed for vulnerability modelling of road structures to prioritise vulnerable structures for improvements, to quantify the cost of reconstruction and/or cost of hardening of structures, and to integrate community resilience considerations into the decision making process."
"Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence and CSR: Radical Feminist Theory and a Human Rights Perspective Fair Trade; Global Value Chains; Global Production Networks This paper extends Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) scholarship to focus on issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence. Despite a significant body of work on gender and CSR from a variety of feminist perspectives, long-standing evidence of sexual harassment and sexual violence in business, particularly in global value chains, and the rise of the #MeToo movement, there has been little scholarship focused specifically on these issues in the context of CSR. Our conceptual paper addresses this gap in the literature through two key contributions. First, we extend the theoretical base of CSR scholarship by drawing upon and explicating radical feminist theory, a resource that has been underutilized in the field to date. This theoretical perspective is well placed to offer insights around the issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence, and to explain the centrality of these concerns to the gender equality agenda in business and in CSR. Second, building upon insights from radical feminism, and from research on CSR and human rights, we explicate a business and human rights approach to sexual harassment, sexual violence and CSR. We point to ways in which this approach might be more effective in addressing these issues than previously adopted strategies and suggest directions for future research arising from our analysis."

"An integrated approach to suitability assessment of municipal solid waste landfills in New South Wales, Australia Waste Disposal Facilities; Site Selection; Solid Waste Management Appropriate planning and strategies in Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management could significantly decrease environmental and economic costs imposing on both management authorities and local communities. MSW landfill siting has been a growing challenge since unsuitability of landfills could cause destructive impacts on the environment and human health in addition to economic costs. In this study, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) are utilised in an integrated decision-making framework to develop an efficient Suitability Index (SI) to assess the suitability of landfills of New South Wales, Australia, with respect to a comprehensive set of evaluation criteria. A preliminary factors map and a concluding composite SI map are developed in the geographic information system environment, and a solid ranking scheme is proposed to assess the landfills. A wide range of statistical analysis is conducted to obtain practical and specific results for different divisions in three different managerial scenarios. Comprehensiveness of the applied decision-making model, efficiency of the developed SI and adequacy of the performed statistical analysis provide a competent supporting tool for the authorities for ongoing landfills replacement plans, rehabilitation plans and future landfill siting programs."

"Waste-Derived Low-Cost Mycelium Nanopapers with Tunable Mechanical and Surface Properties Chitin; Animal Shells; Di-O-Butyrylchitin Mycelium, the vegetative growth of filamentous fungi, has attracted increasing commercial and academic interest in recent years because of its ability to upcycle agricultural and industrial wastes into low-cost, sustainable composite materials. However, mycelium composites typically exhibit foam-like mechanical properties, primarily originating from their weak organic filler constituents. Fungal growth can be alternatively utilized as a low-cost method for on-demand generation of natural nanofibrils, such as chitin and chitosan, which can be grown and isolated from liquid wastes and byproducts in the form of fungal microfilaments. This study characterized polymer extracts and nanopapers produced from a common mushroom reference and various species of fungal mycelium grown on sugarcane byproduct molasses. Polymer yields of âˆ¼10-26% were achieved, which are comparable to those of crustacean-derived chitin, and the nanopapers produced exhibited much higher tensile strengths than the existing mycelium materials, with values of up to âˆ¼25 MPa (mycelium) and âˆ¼98 MPa (mushroom), in addition to useful hydrophobic surface properties resulting from the presence of organic lipid residues in the nanopapers. HCl or H2O2 treatments were used to remove these impurities facilitating tuning of mechanical, thermal, and surface properties of the nanopapers produced. This potentially enables their use in a wide range of applications including coatings, membranes, packaging, and paper."
"The Impact of Blockchain on Supply Chains: A systematic Review Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things Supply chains face many challenges around coordination, information asymmetry, quality assurance, complex disruptions, and traceability. Blockchain is arguably a technology that can address these challenges and make a significant impact. To shed light on the impact of blockchain, we undertake a cross-discipline systematic literature review on blockchain and supply chains. This review focused on identifying blockchainâ€™s current and proposed impacts on the supply chain at three levels: organisational, inter-organisational, and industry. The findings identified twelve core supply chain themes across pre-implementation, post-implementation, and emerging tensions associated with adopting blockchain. These findings extend knowledge by going beyond understanding blockchain and its application and articulating multi-levels of impacts. Based on our review, we propose future research directions. By providing an overview of the current impact of blockchain, the review also offers insights to help managers to make informed decisions around the implementation and use of blockchain in supply chains"
"A study of sustainable practices in the sustainability leadership of international contractors Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative With an increasing global need for sustainable development, numerous world-leading construction corporations have devoted significant efforts to implementing sustainable practices. However, few previous studies have shared these valuable experiences in a systematic and quantitative way. RobecoSAM has published The Sustainability Yearbook annually since 2004, which lists the sustainability leaders in various industries, including the construction industry. Learning from those sustainability leaders in the construction industry can provide useful references for construction-related companies when developing their sustainable development strategies. Based on a comprehensive literature review, this paper identified 51 methods used for improving sustainability performance and 34 outcomes achieved via these methods. These methods and outcomes are used for coding the sustainable practices of sustainability leaders in the construction sector. Using the coding system, 133 annual sustainability reports issued by 22 sustainability leaders (The Sustainability Yearbook, RobecoSAM 2010â€“2016) in the construction sector were analyzed using content analysis. Social network analysis was then employed to identify the key adopted methods and achieved outcomes (KAMAO) of these leaders. The dynamic trend and regional analysis of KAMAO are also presented. These KAMAO findings provide valuable guidance for international contractors to develop a better understanding of the primary sustainable methods adopted by sustainability leaders in the construction sector and the top outcomes achieved by these leaders. The findings also provide a useful reference for international contractors to evaluate their current sustainability-related strategies and make improvements."
"Fire frequency analysis for different climatic stations in Victoria, Australia Flood Frequency; L-Moment; Catchment Area (Hydrology) Frequent occurrence of fire events will have severe impact on Victoriaâ€™s water supply catchments. Hence, it is important to perform fire frequency analysis to obtain fire frequency curves (FFC) on fire intensity using Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) at different parts of Victoria. FFDI is a measure of fire initiation, spreading speed and containment difficulty. FFC will guide water harvesting by providing information with regard to future fire events and the subsequent impact on catchment yield. Five probability distributions, namely normal, Log Pearson Type III (LPIII), gamma, log-normal and Weibull distributions were used for the development of FFCs at ten selected meteorological stations spread all over Victoria. LPIII distribution was identified as the best fit distribution for Victoria and subsequently applied for an additional 30 more stations to show spatial variability for the entire Victoria."

"An Eco-systems Approach to Climate Impacts on Farmer Wellbeing in Konya Closed Basin Agriculture; Indo-Gangetic Plain; Tillage The aim of this study was to examine the impacts of climate change on the wellbeing of farmers in Konya, Turkey. An ecosystems approach was adopted to take a holistic view of the range of inter-related ecological factors. A focus was on psychological and social impacts with a comparison of impacts on farmers engaged in traditional agriculture and those who had adopted conservation agriculture farming practices. Individual interviews and focus groups were conducted with farmers and agricultural workers to gain an increased understanding of the impact of climate change on their wellbeing. The study found that all farmers were under considerable psychological stress and that the introduction of new farming practices such as conservation agriculture led to increased stress in the early stages of adoption. Implications for the psychological and social support of farmers, particularly in the early stages of adoption of new farming practices are highlighted."
"Study protocol for the Healthier Wealthier Families (HWF) pilot randomised controlled trial: Testing the feasibility of delivering financial counselling to families with young children who are identified as experiencing financial hardship by community-based nurses Mental Health Care; Primary Care; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Introduction Poverty and deprivation can harm children's future health, learning, economic productivity and societal participation. The Australian Healthier Wealthier Families project seeks to reduce the childhood inequities caused by poverty and deprivation by creating a systematic referral pathway between two free, community-based services: Universal, well-child nursing services, which provide health and development support to families with children from birth to school entry, and financial counselling. By adapting the successful Scottish 'Healthier Wealthier Children' model, the objectives of this Australian pilot are to test the (1) feasibility of systematising the referral pathway, and (2) short-term impacts on household finances, caregiver health, parenting efficacy and financial service use. Methods and analysis This pilot randomised controlled trial will run in three sites across two Australian states (Victoria and New South Wales), recruiting a total of 180 participants. Nurses identify eligible caregivers with a 6-item, study-designed screening survey for financial hardship. Caregivers who report one or more risk factors and consent are randomised. The intervention is financial counselling. The comparator is usual care plus information from a government money advice website. Feasibility will be evaluated using the number/proportion of caregivers who complete screening, consent and research measures, and access financial counselling. Though powered to assess feasibility, impacts will be measured 6 months post-enrolment with qualitative interviews and questionnaires about caregiver-reported income, loans and costs (adapted from national surveys, for example, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey); health (General Health Questionnaire 1, EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale short-form); efficacy (from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children); and financial service use (study-designed) compared between arms. Ethics and dissemination Ethics committees of the Royal Children's Hospital (HREC/57372/RCHM-2019) and South West Sydney Local Health District (2019/ETH13455) have approved the study. Participants and stakeholders will receive results through regular communication channels comprising meetings, presentations and publications."
"Zinc biofortified wheat cultivar lessens grain cadmium accumulation under cadmium contaminated conditions Biofortification; Zinc Fertilizers; Triticum Turgidum Subsp. Durum Zinc (Zn) efficient wheat genotypes have been developed to enhance grain Zn concentration to combat the Zn malnutrition in humans. However, such biofortified genotypes/cultivars may also take up the toxic metals from heavy-metals contaminated soils due to similarities with Zn uptake and transport mechanisms in plants. This study was designed to explore uptake of a ubiquitous toxic metal i.e., cadmium (Cd) by a Zn-efficient (Zincol-2016) and was compared with Zn-inefficient (Faisalabad- 2008) wheat cultivar. Both wheat cultivars were sown in pots till maturity in Zn and Cd amended soil. Growth and yield response, and distribution of Cd and Zn, in roots, shoot and grains were observed. Significant differences in Zn and Cd concentration in root, shoot and grain were found among both cultivars in response of Zn and Cd application. Zincol-2016 was more efficient cultivar for Zn uptake compared to the Faisalabad-2008. Cd uptake was increased by both cultivars and suppressed plant growth in Cd contaminated soil. However, Zn application in Cd contaminated soil significantly diminished the Cd uptake and vice versa. Interestingly, Cd concentration was higher in root of Zincol-2016 as compared to Faisalabad-2008; similar was the case in shoot of both cultivars, while it was lower in grain of Zincol-2016. In conclusion, Zn efficient cultivar not only produces high Zn grains but also has ability to contain Cd in root and shoot reducing its accumulation in grains. Furthermore, Zn fertilization in Cd contaminated soils can decrease Cd uptake by plants and may be used as an ameliorating strategy to grow wheat in Cd contaminated soils."
"Aeronautical and space textiles Microcapsule; Urea Formaldehyde; Exchangeable Bond Apart from aircraft applications, textile fibres are used in the manufacture of spacesuits. Various raw materials are used for tailoring the spacesuit, including fabrics made from different synthetic fibres. For example, the innermost layer of a suit is made up of a nylon tricot material; the second layer is manufactured with spandex; and the next layer is made up of urethane coated nylon. Manufacturing processes of composites play a significant part in the aerospace industry. It is necessary to choose cost effective, economical, and sustainable processes for the manufacture of composites. Advances in weaving, knitting, braiding, and nonwoven techniques opened new ideas for getting near net shape preforms, which can reduce the manufacturing time, material wastage, and production cost. This chapter deals with the typical synthetic and natural fibres used in the manufacture of aerospace materials, their characterization, manufacturing techniques, and testing methods. It also covers sustainability issues regarding textiles in the aerospace industry."
"Plant trait-environment trends and their conservation implications for riparian wetlands in the Yellow River Ecosystem; Plant Communities; Ecosystem Stability Determining the relationship between plant functional traits and the environment are key for the protection and sustainable utilization of riparian wetlands. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, riparian wetlands are divided into seasonal floodplain wetlands (natural) and pond-like wetlands or paddy fields (artificial). Here, species composition differences were catalogued based on plant functional traits including origin, life history, and wetland affinity in natural and artificial wetlands. Wetland physicochemical characteristics and regional socio-economic parameters collected as indicators of environmental variables were used to analyze the plant functional trait-environment relationship. The results reveal that plant functional traits in the seasonal floodplain wetland are impacted by physicochemical characteristics of habitat. The abundance of annual plants tends to decrease with concentration of heavy metals, while species diversity is mainly determined by soil physical and chemical properties, especially soil pH and temperature. Specifically, wetland-obligate species (not in water) are more resistant to heavy metal content in water than species with other types of wetland affinity. Life history strategies of species in artificial sites tend to be significantly associated with animal husbandry and artificial populations, while the wetland affinity of species is mainly determined by regional agriculture, especially the installation of agricultural covered areas. Furthermore, water quality and nutrients in suspended sediments from the Yellow River affected species diversity and life history strategies by affecting water and soil conditions of surrounding wetlands, especially conductivity and phosphorus levels."
"Comparing Australian garment and childcare homeworkers’ experience of regulation and representation ILO; Personnel; Right to Strike Labour markets in Australia have long been segmented by gender and race. This study compares two highly gendered and racially segmented labour markets, home-based family day care workers and garment homeworkers. The comparative cases examine the broader trends of migration, production and consumption that reinforce gender and racial stereotypes, and discourses that underpin representations that women workers are ideally suited to such work. We theorise the gender and racialised inequalities of homework based on the literature on invisibilisation and social reproduction to explore the vulnerable position of migrant women and the consequences of having limited options, such as legal and social protections and any capacity to collectively organise. Our analysis examines the roles and responses of institutions and conceptualises the socio-political factors that affect the characterisation of homework as non-work or as self-employed entrepreneurial activities. By mapping the differing regulatory trajectories of these two groups of homeworkers in terms of regulation and representation, we find both similarities and differences. While garment homeworkers have achieved recognition through legislation and social mobilisation, their circumstances leave them less likely to access such rights. By contrast, the failure to recognise family day care homeworkers, has left them to market forces. JEL code: J01."
"Precise and compact movement sensors to support the industry 4.0 movement Precise and rapid autonomous movement is crucial for emerging applications ranging from self-driving cars and robotics, to
surgery and other initiatives in the industry 4.0 movement. However, such autonomous movement will require inertial
movement sensors to provide fast and accurate sensing and feedback on the speed and acceleration and enable calculation
of trajectory and position in real time. Inertial movement sensors are used in mass manufactured consumer electronics, such
as mobile phones, but these do not have the accuracy required for future industry 4.0 applications. Higher precision sensors
exist, but they are bulky and expensive and are hence limited mainly to military applications. Realising the vision of industry
4.0 depends on the emergence of sensors that have military precision, but at the cost, size and scale of consumer electronics."

"Women's Refuges and Critical Social Work: Opportunities and Challenges in Advancing Social Justice Emigration And Immigration; Resettlement; Asylum Women's refuges play a crucial role in responding to the needs of women and children experiencing family violence; yet there has been limited research conducted into their operations, practices and challenges faced. This article is informed by critical social work's theoretical tradition of seeking to end social injustice and analyses key opportunities and challenges of providing refuge amidst a neo-liberal context. We draw on interviews and focus groups with service providers and women who had sought access to a refuge, from a study that was undertaken following the Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence in Australia. We found widespread practices by refuges to support social justice for women and children experiencing family violence, as well as challenges and constraints, substantially linked to resource limitations consistent with neo-liberal policies. This research shines a light on innovative refuge practice in local contexts identifying feminist social justice and intersectional practices aligned with critical social work."
"Research priorities and best practices for managing climate risk and climate change adaptation in Australian agriculture Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience The challenges of climate change adaptation in agriculture are examined through the lens of priorities for research, and the use of best management practices (BMPs) to better manage climate risks. The methods and results have two parts. Firstly, a case study from the northern grains region examines the use of BMPs for managing climate risks associated with both climate variability and climate change. A series of industry workshops developed and tested a suite of 24 BMP standards for growing dryland grain crops, including four BMPs on risk management based on the Australian Standards for Risk Management. Secondly, priorities for research on climate change adaptation in the primary industries sector are described and evaluated to assess needs for updating, in response to industry and environmental changes. The analysis reveals strong reasons for increasing the priority given to education and extension on risk management and for developing BMPs for both incremental and transformative adaptation, and especially for deriving methods to achieve widespread adoption of BMPs for managing extreme climatic events. Collaborative development of BMPs involving farmersâ€™/industry/scientists is the process most likely to derive robust BMPs to withstand the complexities of climate risk and build greater resilience of communities and ecosystems."
"Improving outcomes for apartment residents and neighbourhoods Housing Supply; Suburban Area; Brisbane â€¢ The number and proportion of Australians living in apartments is increasing. A broad cross-section of Australian society lives in apartments, but lower-income households are over-represented compared to other dwelling types. â€¢ Lower-income apartment residents have a diverse demographic profile. However, there are identifiable lower-income apartment-resident submarkets in Australian cities. â€¢ Lower-income households are disproportionally affected by challenges associated with apartment living, yet most existing research and policy does not consider the impact of living in density for lower-income residents in particular. â€¢ Underpinning the high-density development of Australian cities is a policy orthodoxy that privileges market-led housing delivery and a reduced government role in direct housing provision and management. In this context, policy interventions directed at lower-income apartment residents have been limited. â€¢ Prior research indicates that experiences of apartment living are mediated by the quality and design of the built environment, the nature and quality of service provision, and the demographic profiles and mix of residents at both the building and local area (precinct) scales. â€¢ Research undertaken for this study, focussing on Sydney and Melbourne, demonstrates that the experiences of apartment living for lower-income apartment residents are influenced by planning and infrastructure provision, urban design, building design and management, neighbourhood amenities and facilities, and ongoing place management and community engagement. â€¢ The research identified five main points of tension in delivering high-density buildings and precincts that meet the needs of lower-income residents. There were tensions between the development and operational phases of a new development; at the interface between private buildings and the public domain; over the alignment of infrastructure needs and delivery; at the intersection of local and state government responsibilities; and in meeting the needs of both current and future residents. â€¢ Improving outcomes for lower-income apartment residents will require shifting current priorities in both policy-making and practice. These changes range from relatively simple interventions to proposals requiring significant buy-in from both the private and public sectors. â€¢ Failure to address the needs of lower-income high-density residents risks undermining the prosperity and cohesion of Australian cities in future years."
"Analysis of factors influencing the creation and stimulation of the Australian market for recycled construction and demolition waste products Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management Growing population and urbanisation have led to a significant increase in construction and demolition (C&D) waste generation. There are urgent calls for government and industry to develop better methods for C&D waste management. The creation and stimulation of a market for recycled construction and demolition waste have emerged as a targeted intervention to divert waste from landfill sites and create a second life for waste material. This study evaluates key factors affecting the creation and stimulation of the market for C&D recycled waste products in Australia. Through an extensive review of the literature and several semi-structured interviews involving 27 stakeholders from across the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, this study establishes four groups of enablers (i.e., encouragement factors, education, enforcement and engagement) and barriers (i.e., operations, market, governance and logistics) to creating and stimulating a market for C&D waste. Furthermore, the institutional theory was applied to findings to demonstrate how normative, coercive and mimetic drivers influence AEC's stakeholders' decisions and justify their C&D waste management practices. The study proposes a Framework for Waste Market Development (FfWMD) to provide practical solutions to overcome the current barriers identified in this study. The study findings guide government decision-makers and AEC industry practitioners to facilitate end markets for C&D waste and contribute to achieving a circular economy (CE). Further empirical studies on the elements of the FfWMD can be developed to test the complex interactions between stakeholders and processes."
"Temperature shocks and energy poverty: Findings from Vietnam Energy; Energy Poverty; Fuelwood Globally, billions of people live in energy poverty without the means to access affordable and clean energy which are fundamental to sustainable development. Climate change is aggravating increasing demand for energy through a general rise in temperatures as well as through short periods of unusually high heat. This paper examines the impact of temperature shocks on energy poverty in Vietnam. Using data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (2010 to 2016) and data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts it finds temperature shocks lead to increases in a measure of multidimensional energy poverty. This finding is robust to different measures of temperature shocks. Households in the North and Central coast regions of Vietnam are most prone to the impacts of temperature shocks as well as households located in rural areas. Further findings suggest that temperature shocks impact on energy poverty through reducing agricultural output."
"Global synthesis of conservation studies reveals the importance of small habitat patches for biodiversity Conservation Planning; Reserve Design; Environmental Protection Island biogeography theory posits that species richness increases with island size and decreases with isolation. This logic underpins much conservation policy and regulation, with preference given to conserving large, highly connected areas, and relative ambivalence shown toward protecting small, isolated habitat patches. We undertook a global synthesis of the relationship between the conservation value of habitat patches and their size and isolation, based on 31 systematic conservation planning studies across four continents. We found that small, isolated patches are inordinately important for biodiversity conservation. Our results provide a powerful argument for redressing the neglect of small, isolated habitat patches, for urgently prioritizing their restoration, and for avoiding simplistic application of island biogeography theory in conservation decisions."
"Improving drought resilience in Northern Murray-Darling Basin farming communities: Is forecast-based financing suitable? Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China A trend towards drier conditions during the April to October â€˜coolâ€™ season across southern Australia has been observed in the past few decades. Frequent and prolonged droughts have a significant impact on the financial stability of affected farming communities. Forecast-based Financing (FbF) is a novel proactive aid approach that provides support measures to increase resilience during the window between drought early warnings, and the actual onset and intensification of drought. Using the Northern Murray-Darling Basin as a case study, we investigated whether FbF combined with a user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought has the potential to increase the drought resilience of Australian farming communities. This study shows that farming businesses most impacted by drought have three common factors: (i) lower levels of business management skills, (ii) lower levels of pre-drought preparedness during non-drought periods, and (iii) slower responses when the intensity of drought increases. The results suggest that FbF in its current form is not recommended for a market economy such as Australia, as forms of direct assistance may have adverse long-term effects through disrupting the market itself and may not encourage farm operators to regularly assess and adapt their drought management strategies. Results also suggest that providing farmers, service providers, and all levels of government with tools that incorporate a user-centred I-EWS for drought can improve overall decision-making before, during, and even after drought. This change from a reactive to a proactive approach to managing drought impacts can be a highly effective form of increasing the drought resilience of farming communities."
"An Eco-systems Approach to Climate Impacts on Farmer Wellbeing in Konya Closed Basin Agriculture; Indo-Gangetic Plain; Tillage The aim of this study was to examine the impacts of climate change on the wellbeing of farmers in Konya, Turkey. An ecosystems approach was adopted to take a holistic view of the range of inter-related ecological factors. A focus was on psychological and social impacts with a comparison of impacts on farmers engaged in traditional agriculture and those who had adopted conservation agriculture farming practices. Individual interviews and focus groups were conducted with farmers and agricultural workers to gain an increased understanding of the impact of climate change on their wellbeing. The study found that all farmers were under considerable psychological stress and that the introduction of new farming practices such as conservation agriculture led to increased stress in the early stages of adoption. Implications for the psychological and social support of farmers, particularly in the early stages of adoption of new farming practices are highlighted."

"Regional drought risk assessment in the Central Highlands and the South of Vietnam Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China This study contributes to a proof-of-concept comprehensive drought risk assessment for Vietnam by (i) incorporating drought exposure and vulnerability based on specific socio-economic conditions of the regions; and (ii) using satellite data including World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Space-based Weather and Climate Extremes Monitoring (SWCEM) products, and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Enhanced U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Global Data for drought hazard assessment. Drought risk assessment which incorporated hazard, exposure and vulnerability components was conducted for 27 provinces from four administrative areas in Vietnam. Drought Hazard Index (DHI) was derived using the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), the Vegetation Health Index (VHI), and surface soil moisture (SSM) to take into account the impact of both meteorological and agricultural drought. Drought Exposure Index (DEI) and Drought Vulnerability Index (DVI) were calculated using statistical data of land use and socio-economic characteristics obtained from Vietnamâ€™s statistical yearbooks. By combining DHI, DEI and DVI, a composite Drought Risk Index (DRI) was derived for drought risk assessment in the selected provinces for 2020. It was shown that the highest at-risk provinces were in the Mekong River Delta, the agricultural production centre of Vietnam. The South East regions were less impacted by drought compared to other regions. The proposed comprehensive approach to drought risk assessment in Vietnam has potential to contribute to improving drought preparedness and resilience of communities at-risk."

"Technology-Facilitated Domestic Violence Against Immigrant and Refugee Women: A Qualitative Study Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Help-Seeking Digital technologies are increasingly being used as tools for the perpetration of domestic violence. Little empirical research to date has explored the nature and impacts of technology-facilitated domestic violence (TFDV), and even less attention has been paid to the experiences of immigrant and refugee women. This article examines the nature and impacts of TFDV as experienced by immigrant and refugee women. Drawing on interviews with 29 victim-survivors and 20 stakeholders, we argue that although immigrant and refugee women may experience TFDV in similar ways to non-immigrant and refugee women, they face unique challenges, such as language barriers, cultural bias from support services, lack of financial resources, lack of trust in state institutions, and additional challenges with justice and migration systems. Immigrant and refugee women also face multiple structural layers of oppression and social inequality. Accordingly, we argue that a multifaceted approach is required to address TFDV that includes culturally sensitive and specific law reform, education, and training."
"Current status of and future opportunities for digital agriculture in Australia Energy Transition; Innovation System; Sustainability In Australia, digital agriculture is considered immature and its adoption ad hoc, despite a relatively advanced technology innovation sector. In this review, we focus on the technical, governance and social factors of digital adoption that have created a disconnect between technology development and the end user community (farmers and their advisors). Using examples that reflect both successes and barriers in Australian agriculture, we first explore the current enabling technologies and processes, and then we highlight some of the key socio-technical factors that explain why digital agriculture is immature and ad hoc. Pronounced issues include fragmentation of the innovation system (and digital tools), and a lack of enabling legislation and policy to support technology deployment. To overcome such issues and increase adoption, clear value propositions for change are necessary. These value propositions are influenced by the perceptions and aspirations of individuals, the delivery of digitally-enabled processes and the supporting legislative, policy and educational structures, better use/conversion of data generated through technology applications to knowledge for supporting decision making, and the suitability of the technology. Agronomists and early adopter farmers will play a significant role in closing the technology-end user gap, and will need support and training from technology service providers, government bodies and peer-networks. Ultimately, practice change will only be achieved through mutual understanding, ownership and trust. This will occur when farmers and their advisors are an integral part of the entire digital innovation system."

"The impact of wastewater characteristics, algal species selection and immobilisation on simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Nutrient removal from wastewater reduces the environmental impact of its discharge and provides opportunity for water reclamation. Algae can accomplish simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal while also adding value to the wastewater treatment process through resource recovery. The application of algae to wastewater treatment has been limited by a low rate of nutrient removal and difficulty in recovering the algal biomass. Immobilising the algal cells can aid in overcoming both these issues and so improve the feasibility of algal wastewater treatment. Trends for nutrient removal by algal systems over different wastewater characteristics and physical conditions are reviewed. The impact that the selection of algal species and immobilisation has on simultaneous nutrient removal as well as the interdependence of nitrogen and phosphorus are established. Understanding these behaviours will allow the performance of algal wastewater treatment systems to be predicted, assist in their optimisation, and help to identify directions for future research."
"Advanced microbial fuel cell for waste water treatment—a review Bioenergy; Regenerative Fuel Cells; Bioelectricity Petroleum, coal, and natural gas reservoir were depleting continuously due to an increase in industrialization, which enforced study to identify alternative sources. The next option is the renewable resources which are most important for energy purpose coupled with environmental problem reduction. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have become a promising approach to generate cleaner and more sustainable electrical energy. The involvement of various disciplines had been contributing to enhancing the performance of the MFCs. This review covers the performance of MFC along with different wastewater as a substrate in terms of treatment efficiencies as well as for energy generation. Apart from this, effect of various parameters and use of different nanomaterials for performance of MFC were also studied. From the current study, it proves that the use of microbial fuel cell along with the use of nanomaterials could be the waste and energy-related problem-solving approach. MFC could be better in performances based on optimized process parameters for handling any wastewater from industrial process."
"On Designing Learning Control Scheme for Multilayer Supply Chain Networks With Constraints Extreme Learning Machine; Learning Systems; Moore-Penrose Generalized Inverse In this study, a new learning control scheme is designed to investigate the stability of a multilayer supply chain network (SCN) and to further improve the convergence speed of the nodes' states of such a multilayer SCN. Specifically, a multilayer SCN model with three layers is first established and some practical constraints on the states of the proposed SCN model are involved and discussed. By taking the quantities of goods transmitted between different nodes as control inputs, a new kind of learning control scheme is subsequently proposed to discuss the stability of the nodes' states within the SCN. It is further shown that the convergence speed of nodes' states with this scheme is faster than that yielded by using some traditional schemes. The contributions of our scheme are twofold: 1) it can save the limited control resource and 2) it can improve the convergence speeds of the states of all nodes. Numerical simulations are finally given to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the designed learning scheme."
"Future aircraft concepts and design methods Conceptual Design; Aerospace Vehicles; Transdisciplinary With an annual growth in travel demand of about 5% globally, managing the environmental impact is a challenge. In 2019, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) issued emission reduction targets, including well-to-wake greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduced at least 50% from 2005 levels by 2050. This discusses several technologies from an aircraft design perspective that can contribute to achieving these targets. One thing is certain: aircraft will look different in the future. The Transonic Truss-Braced Wing and Flying V configurations are promising significant efficiency improvements over conventional configurations. Electric propulsion, in various architectures, is becoming a feasible option for general aviation and commuter aircraft. It will be a growing field of aviation with zero-emissions flight and opportunities for special missions. Lastly, this paper discusses methods and design processes that include all relevant disciplines to ensure that the aircraft is optimised as a complete system. While empirical methods are essential for initial design, Multidisciplinary Design Optimisation (MDO) incorporates models and simulations integrated in an optimisation environment to capture critical trade-offs. Concurrent design places domain experts in one site to facilitate collaboration, interaction, and joint decision-making, and to ensure all disciplines are equally considered. It is supported by a Collaborative Design Facility (CDF), an information technology facility with connected hardware and software tools for design analysis."
"Earnings management and bank risk-taking behavior in Asia-Pacific region Loan Loss Provisions; Fair Value; International Financial Reporting Standards The issue of bank risk-taking behavior has regained attention in Asia-Pacific banking sector as banks in this region are facing rising risk and capital costs. This study investigates the association between earnings management and risk-taking behavior in Asia-Pacific banks. We argue that earnings management induces banks to invest in riskier assets to â€˜search for yieldâ€™ since earnings management increases banksâ€™ capital cost leading to reduction in profitability. Using a sample of 237 listed commercial banks across 13 Asia-Pacific countries and territories in the period of 2001â€“2017, our research finds that there is a significant positive relationship between earnings management using loan loss provisions and bank risk-taking behavior."
"Exploring the factors affecting sustainable human resource productivity in railway lines Labour Productivity; Construction Industry; Crews This study aimed to identify the critical factors and items affecting the productivity of sustainable human resources in a Railway Operation Company based on the perceptions of employees and managers in the Human Resources Department. The study was motivated by research which was applied in terms of the objectives of the study and a descriptive survey was employed as the method. The statistical population of the current study consisted of all employees and managers of the Human Resources Department of the company. Random sampling was employed to collect data and the sample size was 191 people according to Morganâ€™s Table. Methods including the correlation coefficient, multivariate regression, and factor analysis were employed for data analysis.

This study is the first study that has aimed to discuss the perceptions of the Human Resources Department active in a company. As such, the study highlights the standpoint of the main decision makers in the Urban and Suburban Railway Operation Company with regard to labour productivity in the urban and suburban sector."
"Recent advances in passive cooling techniques Heat Islands; Reflective Coatings; Roofs The building sector is responsible for consuming roughly 32% of the global final energy use (IEA, 2012) and emitting roughly 36% of all greenhouse gas emissions (European Commission, 2014). In the European continent, the building sector accounts for over 40% of the overall energy used (Torgal and Jalali, 2011). Recently, the Asian tropical region, consisting of countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, has undergone increased urbanization because of the rapid growth in the urban population (Al-Obaidi et al., 2014). In India, the energy consumption rate has increased by 7.5% in 2014â€“ 2015, the highest growth rate among the developing countries (Times of India, 2015). The Global Buildings Performance Network (GBPN) reported that if the existing business-as-usual policy for buildings is followed, India could easily experience an increase in building energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of around 700% by 2050 compared to the 2005 levels (Rawal and Shukla, 2014)."
"Alginate-immobilised algal wastewater treatment enhanced by species selection Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Immobilisation of algae by entrapment in alginate beads enables rapid nitrogen and phosphorus removal from wastewater and simplifies biomass harvesting for resource recovery. The alginate beads provide a protected environment for algal cultivation, enabling a species to be selected with less risk of contamination occurring during wastewater treatment. Immobilised Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus abundans, Selenastrum capricornutum and Coelastrum microporum were compared in terms of the nutrient uptake capacity of each bead with the aim of selecting the species with highest uptake and so reducing the operational cost of bead generation. The N:P ratio assimilated from the wastewater varied markedly between species and was not affected by cultivation in N-depleted or P-depleted medium before immobilisation. This indicated species could be selected based on the relative importance of N or P removal for the site, or tailored to the wastewater, with C. vulgaris (cellular N:P of 6.1 Â± 0.2) and S. abundans (2.6 Â± 0.1) best suited for wastewater with a high and low N:P ratio, respectively. S. abundans adapted best to the restricted growth environment of the alginate matrix, assimilated the most P per cell (reducing interference of wastewater PO43âˆ’ with the Ca-alginate structure), and thus led to the most durable beads during semi-continuous treatment of wastewater. This species gave the longest treatment duration of 42 days and algal cell production of 1.36 Â± 0.7 Ã— 107 cells/bead. S. abundans also achieved the greatest nutrient removal capacity (101 Â± 8 Î¼g N/bead and 45.9 Â± 1.9 Î¼g P/bead), demonstrating that the cost of alginate bead supply per unit of nutrient removed could be reduced and potential resource recovery from the biomass increased."
"A global review of consumer behavior towards e-waste and implications for the circular economy E-Waste; Electronic Waste; Electronic Equipment To tackle the alarming increase in e-waste or end-of-life (EoL) electronic products, consumer behavior towards the end of their useful life needs to be thoroughly studied. End users or consumers are the starting point where e-waste starts its journey into several paths within the circular economy (CE), such as repair, reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling. E-waste often ends up in landfill due to improper disposal of e-waste with household waste by consumers. Studying consumer behavior allows for the identification of appropriate approaches to achieve CE. Numerous academic journal papers have been published concerning consumers' e-waste-related knowledge and awareness, and behavior on consumption, disposal, storage, recycling, and repair. Substantial knowledge gap exists around how understandings of consumer behavior around e-waste may be integrated into the CE model. This article aims to reduce this gap by reviewing 109 research papers published in international peer-reviewed journals identified in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection database, using content analysis methodology to analyze and review the articles. The study aims to provide invaluable input for developing a more consumer-centric CE framework for both policymakers and researchers seeking to advance knowledge and implementation strategies around e-waste. This is one of the earliest systematic reviews of studies on consumer behavior around e-waste. The study results show that consumers' disposal and recycling behaviors are the two main areas of research interest in the studies reviewed. In contrast, reuse and repair behavior were investigated to a lesser extent. In this study, several research gaps and areas for future research are identified, along with suggestions for a CE framework focusing on the e-waste sector that, encompasses policy initiatives and business model innovations. The identified studies presented here offer a valuable starting point for researchers who are starting to work on consumer behavior-related e-waste research."

"Interventions to support autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs in organizations: A systematic review with recommendations for research and practice Need Satisfaction; Self-Determination Theory; Physical Education Organizational research underpinned by self-determination theory (SDT) has grown substantially over the past decade. However, the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote support for basic psychological needs in organizations remains ill documented. We thus report the results of a qualitative systematic review and synthesis of SDT-informed studies of interventions to cultivate autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs, and in turn, autonomous motivation in organizational contexts. Studies were included in the review if they evaluated the effect of interventions to develop autonomy-, competence-, or relatedness-supportive work climates or leader behaviours. A systematic search yielded ten eligible field studies for inclusion: three randomized-controlled trials and seven non-randomized intervention studies (combined N = 2,337). Seven studies yielded mostly favourable effects, two yielded mixed effects, and one study showed no evidence of change post-intervention. Substantial heterogeneity in intervention format and delivery existed across studies. Studies pointed towards possible moderators of effectiveness. Interventions were more effective at spawning change at the proximal (leader) level than at the distal (subordinate) level, though few studies tracked employees over time to comprehensively evaluate long-term transfer. Bias assessments showed that risk of bias was moderate or high across studies. We discuss overall implications of the review and suggest several recommendations for future intervention research and practice. Practitioner points: Interventions to help leaders to support subordinates' basic psychological needs are effective in creating change in leader behaviour. Intervention effects for subordinate outcomes are smaller and may take time to materialize. Interventions tend to be more effective if they are aligned with organizational strategic needs, proactively consider unique work contexts, are endorsed by senior levels of management, and give preference to pedagogy that aligns with basic needs."
"Effects of manure waste biochars in mining soils Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Land degradation by old mining activities is a concern worldwide. However, many known technologies are expensive and cannot be considered for mining soil restoration. Biochar amendment of mining soils is becoming an interesting alternative to traditional technologies due to an improvement in soil properties and metal mobility reduction. Biochar effects depend on soil and biochar properties, which in turn vary with pyrolysis conversion parameters and the feedstock used. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of four biochars prepared from poultry and rabbit manure at two pyrolysis temperatures (450 and 600 Â°C) in the trace metal mobility, CO2 emissions, and enzymatic activity of 10 mining soils located in three historical mining areas of Spain (Zarandas-Andalusia, Mijarojos-Cantabria, and Portman-Murcia). For this reason, soils were amended with biochars at a rate of 10% (w/w), and different treatments were incubated for 180 days. For acid soils of the Zarandas-Andalusia area, biochar addition reduced the mobility of Ni, Zn, Cd, Pb, and Cr, respectively, by 91%, 81%, 29%, 67%, and 70%. Nevertheless, biochars did not exhibit the same efficiency in the other two areas where alkaline soils were predominant. CO2 emissions generally increased in the treated soils. The application of biochars produced at 600 Â°C reduced CO2 emissions, in some cases by more than 28%, being an adequate strategy for C sequestration in soil. The results showed that application of manure biochars can be an effective technique to reduce the mobility of metals in multi-contaminated acid soils, while reducing metal toxicity for soil microorganisms."

"Using a Risk-based Approach for Derivation of Water Quality Guidelines for Sulphate Ceriodaphnia Dubia; Daphnia Magna; Metals Sulphate is a major salt component in acid mine drainage and a crucial ecological concern in most coal and gold mining regions, globally. However, there remains a paucity of data on sulphate salinity toxicity on freshwater taxa. In this study, we hypothesised sensitivity differences for five freshwater species (Adenophlebia auriculata, Burnupia stenochorias, Caridina nilotica, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Oreochromis mossambicus) to increasing sulphate salinity concentrations after 240 h of exposure. Species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) were used to rank the sensitivity of tested species to the inorganic sulphate salts, which included magnesium sulphate (MgSO4), sodium sulphate (Na2SO4), and calcium sulphate (CaSO4) as models of mining salinisation in South Africa. The SSDs were also used to estimate appropriate protective concentrations of the salts for the tested species. Sensitivity differences were measured and Na2SO4 was the most toxic of the tested salts. A concentration of 0.020 g/L Na2SO4, 0.055 g/L CaSO4, and 0.108 g/L MgSO4 or a combined salts limit of 0.067 g/L would be protective of 95% of the populations of the five species tested; these all suggest that the 0.25 g/L compliance limit for South Africa is insufficient. Future studies should incorporate more species in the SSD approach to be coupled by field validations to further improve the ecological relevance of these findings."

"Photocatalytic Activity of Carbon Nanotube/Zinc Oxide Nanocomposite for Solar Energy Based Water Treatment and Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting Photocatalytic Activity; Zinc Oxide; Zinc Acetate Fluorine doped Tin Oxide (FTO) was used as the substrate for the synthesis of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes/Zinc Oxide nanorods composites. The first composite was a layer-by-layer sample of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes/Zinc Oxide nanorods and the second was a mixed sample of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes/Zinc Oxide nanorods. Characterisation techniques including XRD, FE-SEM and UV-Visible spectroscopy were performed on both the composites to investigate the diffraction peaks, morphology and band gap energy, respectively. Dye degradation and Photoeletrochemical (PEC) performance of both the composites were studied and the results proved that the photocatalytic activity and the photoelectrochemical performance were improved by the incorporation of MWCNT with ZnO nanorods. The highest dye degradation of 64.44% and 39.57% under UV and AM1.5G illumination and the highest photocurrent density of 1.5x10-4 A/cm2 and 8.0x10-5A/cm2 under UV and AM1.5G illumination were achieved by the MWCNT/ZnO layer-by-layer sample. This makes MWCNT/ZnO nanorods layer-by-layer sample a promising candidate for the removal of organic dyes from waste waters and for the production of Hydrogen as a source of sustainable energy by using the abundant light energy for water splitting."

"Presence and characterization of microplastics in fish of commercial importance from the Biobío region in central Chile Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter In this study we have identified and characterized microplastic particles (MPs) found in six fish species of commercial importance in central Chile. The fish species belong to different trophic levels and were obtained from the oceanic and coastal habitats. To analyze MPs, the fish gastrointestinal content was extracted, analyzed and characterized using a microscopy equipped with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The MPs found in fish samples were mainly constituted by red microfibers (70â€“100%) with sizes ranging between 176 and 2842 Î¼m. Polyester, polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were identified as the prevalent polymers detected. The coastal species showed the presence of microfibers with a higher size and abundance (71%) compared to oceanic species (29%), suggesting there is a greater exposure risk. These findings are consistent with results found in other investigations worldwide. However, further research is still needed to accurately establish the potential exposure risk for the public consuming these fish and the impact of MPs in the Chilean fishery activities."
"Reducing jaywalking and distracted walking behaviour at intersections C383 Dr Nirajan Shiwakoti (School of Engineering) and A/Prof Richard Tay (School of Business IT & Logistics) successfully applied to the Transport Accident Commission's (TAC) Community Road Safety Grants Program for funding to undertake the Project titled Reducing jaywalking and distracted walking behaviour at intersections (Project).

Victoria's road safety strategy is based on the Safe System approach and relies on research, soud principles and detailed evaluating of new programs.  Road safety programs are usually funded only if there are sound reasos to believe they will reduce the risk of crash involvelment.

Road safety programs are evaluated periodically to understand the elements contributing to the best possible community road safety benefits."
"Greenium in the Chinese corporate bond market Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy This paper explores the pricing implications of green bonds in the Chinese corporate bond market. We document a large greenium in the Chinese green bond market, whereby green bonds are issued at lower offering yield spreads in the primary market and traded at lower yields in the secondary market. The magnitude of the Chinese greenium is substantially greater than other international green bond markets. Exploring the underlying mechanisms, we document convincing evidence that mitigation of information asymmetry and exposure to salient environmental stimuli such as air pollution are plausible explanations of the greenium."
"Pure Land UNWIRED: New approaches to virtual reality for heritage at risk Virtual Reality; Methodology; Locomotion The Mogao Grottoes located in Gansu Province of north-western China consist of 492 cells and cave sanctuaries carved into the cliffs above the Dachuan River in Mogao.

"Feminism, masculinity politics and the human services Young; Sex Education; Sexuality Feminists in the human services have drawn attention to the prevalence of sexist attitudes and practices in social welfare and, female human service workers have developed interventions and policies aimed at overcoming sexism. The contemporary male radical social work literature neglects analyses of masculinity and practice with men. There are a variety of ways of classifying the menâ€™s movement. The chapter identifies four distinct approaches: menâ€™s rights, mythopoetics, menâ€™s liberation and pro-feminism. These four trends have been the source of considerable conflict in menâ€™s politics from its beginning. A key argument of the menâ€™s rights movement is that men are unfairly blamed by women and feminism. The emphasis of much of the menâ€™s rightsâ€™ response to feminism is that women are equally responsible for the problems in the world and the issues confronting them. Profeminism for men involves a sense of responsibility to our own and other menâ€™s sexism, and a commitment to work with women to end menâ€™s violence."
"Thermally activated epoxy-functionalized carbon as an electrocatalyst for efficient NOx reduction Fe(II)-Edta; Oxidation; Denitrification Large toxic emissions like nitrogen and sulphur oxides (NOx, SO2) are causing serious environmental and health issues. Catalytic reduction of NOx and SOx into friendly gases is considered one of the best approaches. However, regeneration of catalyst, higher bond-dissociation energy for NOx, i.e., 150.7 kcal/mol, escape of intermediate gas (N2O, a greenhouse gas) with treated flue-gas, and limited activity of catalyst remains a great challenge. Here, a cheap, binderless naturally-extracted bass-wood thin carbon electrode (TCE) was fabricated, which shows excellent catalytic activity towards NOx reduction. The bass-wood carbonization was carried out at 900 Â°C followed by thermal activation in the presence of CO2 gas at 750 Â°C. The thermal activation resulted in increased epoxy groups on the surface of the TCE and enhancement in the surface area as well as the degree of graphitization. The TCE unique 3D strongly inter-connected network through hierarchical micro/meso/macro pores that allow large electrode/electrolyte interface. Owing to these characteristics, the TCE exhibited excellent catalytic efficiency towards NOx (âˆ¼83.3%) under ambient conditions and enhanced catalytic response around neutral pH and sulphite exposure as well as excellent stability up to 168 h. Moreover, a temperature-dependent activity trend was found where the highest catalytic activity was achieved at 80 Â°C beyond which the electrolyte became evaporative and resulted in performance decrease. The designed electrocatalyst is low-cost, sustainable and showed great potential for effective NOx-reduction, which might be used for NOx abatement at large scale."
"Content analysis of responses to The Line, an Australian primary prevention of violence against women campaign on Facebook Sexual Assault; Bystander; Crime Victims Issue addressed: Primary prevention of violence against women (PVAW) strategies and campaigns aim to address and challenge violence-supportive behaviour and normative social structures to intervene before violence happens. Towards this aim, from 2014 to 2019, The Line was a public Australian Commonwealth-supported PVAW campaign on social media that targeted young people. This study explores how young people discussed PVAW-related themes on the campaign's Facebook page. Methods: Social media scraping tools were used to collect 346 941 comments on The Line's Facebook page from 2014 to 2017. In this study, 3663 comments included three high frequency, PVAW-related key terms, â€˜violenceâ€™ (1430 comments), â€˜genderâ€™ (1602 comments) and â€˜consentâ€™ (631 comments). These were identified and were thematically coded. Results: Young people's comments indicated high support for violence prevention but varied in how they understood gendered violence and factors that contribute to it, and instead, some argued that the campaign should not ignore men. Some young people who engaged with The Line on a long-term basis and spoke to its aims, proposed interpretations from their experiences, and challenged the campaign to progress. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that young people influence each other by adopting and disrupting PVAW knowledge in a publicly funded social media campaign. So what?: Public PVAW social media campaigns can encourage young people to discuss gendered violence online. However, successful campaigns need ongoing support to develop conversations with target populations that allow diverse audiences to build their knowledge."
"Design and demonstration of an islanded hybrid microgrid for an enormous motel with the appropriate solicitation of superfluous energy by using iHOGA and matlab Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems The urge for Electrical Power is escalating regularly at an increased rate due to the internationalization and progression of civilization. However, proper economic consumption of additional energy produced from the Islanded Hybrid Microgrid System (IHMS) that has not been consumed by the load is a major challenge globally. To overcome the above mentioned summon, this research focuses on a multi-optimal combination of stand-alone IHMS for Tioman Motel located at Tioman Island, Malaysia with an efficient exertion of redundant energy. To avail of this excess energy efficiently, an electrical heater along with a storage tank has been designed concerning diversion load having proper energy management. Furthermore, the system design has adopted the improved hybrid optimization by genetic algorithms (IHOGA) software for profitable and practical analysis of the designated configuration. Moreover, the optimal size of every module has been tested and analyzed through MATLAB Simulink and stabilized the whole system by representing the values of 1297 and 15 096 kW have been determined as the approximated peak and average load per day for the Motel, respectively. Moreover, the optimized IHMS is comprehended of Photovoltaic (PV) cells, Diesel Generator, Wind Turbine, Battery, and Converter. Adjacent to this, the optimized system ensued in having a net present cost (NPC) of $19.77 million, Renewable Fraction (RF) of 23%, cost of energy (COE) of $0.175/kWh, CO2 of 1 726 825 kg/year and excess energy of 532.26MWh per annum. Whereas, the system involved with the diesel generator lead a COE of $0.315/kWh, CO2 of 6 213 353 kg/year and NPC of $22.12 million. Additionally, this design alone with diesel generator has a higher CO2 emission rate, COE and NPC compared to optimized IHMS. On the other hand, the amount of excess energy is effectively utilized with an electrical heater as a diversion load."
"Influence of soil moisture regimes on growth, photosynthetic capacity, leaf biochemistry and reproductive capabilities of the invasive agronomic weed; Lactuca serriola Plant Leaves; Stomatal Conductance; Photosynthesis Global temperatures are predicted to increase by 1.5â€“5.9C during this century, and this change is likely to impact average rainfall, with predictions that water deficit will perhaps be the most severe threat to sustainable agriculture. In this respect, invasive weeds, which have traits better adapted to drought stress than crops, add to concerns regarding crop sustainability. Lactuca serriola, an aggressive agronomic weed is thought to be a successful weed because of its ability to maintain high water use efficiency under drought conditions. In this study, experiments were conducted to examine the influence of different soil moisture regimes (100%, 75%, 50% and 25% water holding capacity (WHC)) on growth, photosynthetic capacity, leaf biochemistry and reproduction of this species. Soil moisture significantly affected plantâ€™s height, stem diameter, number of leaves and biomass. The highest plant height (115.14 cm Â± 11.64), shoot diameter (9.4 mm Â± 0.18), leaf area (1206.5 mm2 Â± 73.29), plant fresh weight (83.1 Â± 3.98) and dry weight (22.38 Â± 1.24) were recorded at 75% soil moisture content. A fundamental adaptation to drought was observed as plants in the 25% WHC treatment had the highest root: shoot ratio. Soluble sugars and total phenolic content were highest in the 25% WHC treatment and significantly different to 100% WHC which was a response to soil moisture stress to ameliorate the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species produced under stress conditions. Results also indicate that L. serriola can survive and produce seeds under water stress as more than 6000 seeds were produced per plant in all WHC treatments. In this study, there was no significant difference in the seed weight, number of seeds produced and their germination ability. This can have a huge impact on agricultural systems as the species can survive both under low and high soil moisture conditions. We therefore suggest that the demonstrated ability of L. serriola to complete its life cycle and produce biomass and seeds under water stressed conditions leads to the introduction of strategies that minimize weed survival while maximizing irrigation efficiency for the crop. A clear understanding of the ecological and biological characteristics of this weed will help land managers take appropriate control measures to mitigate the effect of this species on economic crop productivity."
"Identification of micro-plastics in Australian road dust Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter The threat of micro-plastics in the marine environment is seriously being recognized worldwide for the dangers it is posing to not only the marine life and biodiversity but even to the human beings that form part of this food chain. The majority of these micro-plastics are considered to be generated from the wear-out of vehicle tyres. In Australia, there is a complete lack of scientific evidence to support the extent to which MPs are released from the road dust. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify the presence of micro-plastics in Australian road dust and the results were validated using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy material characterization techniques. The results clearly show the presence of a large number of tyre wear-out particles in small amounts of road dust samples collected from two separate suburban locations of metropolitan Melbourne area."
"Power distance in India: Paternalism, religion and caste: some issues surrounding the implementation of lean production techniques Lean Manufacturing; Value Stream Mapping; Kaizen Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how cultural differentiation can affect the successful transplantation of lean management and production techniques from the parent country to subsidiary countries in the developing world. In particular, the focus will be on car manufacture in India and the role of hierarchy in Indian society, with reflection on how this seeps into workplace and power relations. Design/methodology/approach: Lean production techniques have been hailed as revolutionising modern manufacturing, particularly in the automotive sector. In developed world countries, car manufacturers have made significant gains in efficiency and productivity as a result of their implementation. However, as many of these multinational companies (MNCs) have expanded production into rapidly-developing nations to take advantage of both their market and low-labour costs, the introduction of lean production practices have met some resistance. This is because certain underpinning concepts and values of the lean system, such as team work, delegation of authority and upward communication can be considered incompatible with aspects of local culture and employeesâ€™ attitude towards work and their superiors. The analysis presented is based on a series of semi-structured interviews with managers and workers from an India-based subsidiary of a MNC car manufacturer and engagement with the existing literature. Findings: It concludes that paternal relationships, religious values and group orientation in Indian society have a significant impact on the dynamics of the workplace and result in a brand of power distance that is specific to this national context, raising questions about the suitability of universal implementation of lean production practices. Originality/value: â€œPower distanceâ€ has become a catch-all term for cultures with an orientation towards hierarchy and status in society. However, this categorisation masks some of the factors belying the phenomenon and intricacies relating to how it plays out in the workplace. It is simplistic to postulate that high power distance cultures might be incompatible with management approaches that decentralise authority and increase worker participation. Rather than rely on overgeneralisations, the analysis provided has attempted to deconstruct the composition of power distance in the Indian context and document systematically how features of Indian culture conflict with the principles of lean production techniques, using a case study from an Indian subsidiary of a MNC. In particular, the study finds that religion, caste and paternalism create an India-specific power distance that manifests itself in worker behaviour and workplace relationships."

"Does weather, or energy prices, affect carbon prices? Emissions Trading Scheme; Carbon Markets; China This study investigates the extent that key energy prices (coal, gas, oil and electricity) and weather explain carbon prices, a key feature of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), and whether this relationship changed since full auctioning came into effect in 2013. Energy prices were found to impact the carbon price in phase III of the EU ETS. However, modelling based solely on energy prices explained only 12% of carbon price variation. Weather variables did not affect the carbon price except for unanticipated temperature changes. These results indicate that it is not the level of temperature that impacts the carbon price, rather it is unanticipated changes in temperature that matter. Given that climate change is associated with increased variance in temperature, this result is consistent with climate change resulting in greater carbon price volatility and higher hedging costs."
"Reading in the Mallee: The Literary Past and Future of an Australian Region (administered by Deakin University) Led by Deakin University. This project will explore the capacity of local reading practices to challenge narrow narratives of Australian regions, and to generate diverse, dynamic and inclusive accounts of community and place identity. Taking the Mallee in Victoria – an iconic and emblematic region in the Australian cultural imaginary – as exemplar, the project will innovate as it centralises both historic and contemporary reader-generated knowledge in the making of regional literary history, and brings participatory methods drawn from literary and creative practice into this process. The project will build capacity for local readers and literary stakeholders in the region, diversify available narratives of the Mallee, and enhance regional literary infrastructure."

"The Environmental Kuznets Curve across Australian states and territories Environmental Kuznets Curve; China; Trade Openness We test the Environmental Kuznets Curves (EKC) hypothesis for a panel of eight Australian states and territories using non-parametric panel estimation over the period 1990 to 2017. A feature of our non-parametric estimation method is that it allows carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to evolve over time in the form of an unknown functional form with confidence bands constructed using a wild bootstrapping method. This framework has the advantage that we can plot the time-varying relationship between Gross State Product (GSP) and CO2 emissions. The non-parametric local linear estimates for GSP are consistent with a conventional inverted U-shaped EKC, which peaks in 2010 and declines thereafter. The peak coincides with a significant policy shift in Australia's commitment to reducing CO2 emissions, whereby, in 2010, the Australian Government, and subsequently the states and territories, pledged to reduce CO2 emissions to 5% below 2000 levels by 2020 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (the Cancun Agreement)."
"Spatio-temporal assessment of social resilience to tropical cyclones in coastal Bangladesh Bangladesh; Cyclonic Storms; Disaster Tropical cyclones wreak havoc on the lives of coastal populations, especially in marginalised communities in developing countries where cyclone impacts are disproportionately lethal compared to developed countries. These populations must implement measures that enable them to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyclone impacts. Using empirical evidence, this study presents a spatio-temporally explicit, index-based assessment technique to assess social resilience to tropical cyclones. The key components of social resilience were extracted by Principal Component Analysis; distinct resilience indices were generated and mapped for the three disaster phases. The most influential components were then aggregated into an Effective Social Resilience Index (ESoRI), which was mapped across the study area. The technique was applied in a coastal sub-district of Bangladesh to demonstrate the approach. Basic preparedness training, emergency response, social bonding, and reconstruction and rehabilitation strongly influenced resilience in ways that corresponded closely to the phases of the disaster-management cycle: preparedness, response, and recovery. The spatial pattern of resilience revealed that social resilience varies significantly in time and space within a circumscribed locale. Importantly, areas close to the sea and rivers were found to be more resilient despite their high exposure to cyclones and lack of external support. This study will guide policymakers concerned with resilience building on a priority basis such as those working in resource-scarce conditions of developing countries."
"Wear your digital mask, fight this virus like it’s the enemy: pandemic user-citizenship as platform-infrastructure entanglements Platforms; Multi-Sided Platform; Interchange Fee This paper articulates the emergence of the user-citizen as a result of techno-solutionist approaches to pandemic management by tracing the rapid infrastructuralisation of surveillance in and through the platformisation of pandemic governance in Vietnam. Coinciding with Vietnamâ€™s rollout of chip-based national identification cards for citizens over the age of 14, the development of a one-stop â€˜super-appâ€™ solution that streamlines data flows across different domains of authority happened in a context where platforms were increasingly discussed alongside, and understood on the same terms as, infrastructure. By conducting situational analysis of publicly available policy documents and official government communication, the paper traces how pandemic platforms contract and expand in response to evolving pandemic management needs, and gives an account of the evolution of institutional dependency across different domains of authority and technology development. Using Vietnam as a case study, this paper contributes to ongoing theorisation at the intersection of platformisation and infrastructuralisation in pandemic social service provision. The paper is an invitation to examine the increasing entanglements of technology and citizenship performances around the world as they unfold throughout the course of the pandemic and beyond."
"Virtual power plants for a sustainable urban future Microgrid; Demand Response; Power Plants Due to rapid population growth and urbanisation, more than ever we need an urban environment with greater efficiency and fewer negative impacts. Virtual power plant (VPP) has great potential for improving urban sustainability by supplying clean energy from distributed generators. This paper provides a literature review on VPP from the perspective of urban sustainability. We apply a scientometric literature review approach, and 1225 publications were collected for data visualization and network analysis. Three focus areas, components, operation strategies and problem-solving techniques are identified by the scientometric analysis. A deeper investigation is then conducted to further reveal the role VPP can play in a sustainable urban future. It is found that the intellectual structure of this domain has been well established by previous studies in terms of optimisation, communication and control technologies. However, limitations and gaps also exist from the standpoint of urban environment, such as limitations in adopting innovative technologies, sustainability consideration, stakeholder involvement and urban environment dynamics. This paper contributes to the academic society by analysing the progress and limitations of VPP research and providing the guideline for future research to address urban sustainability issues."

"Flood Vulnerability Assessment and Mapping: A Case Study for Australia’s Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment Flood Damage; Flooding; Natural Hazards Floods are one of the most destructive natural hazards to which Australia is exposed. The frequency of extreme rainfall events and consequential floods are projected to increase into the future as a result of anthropogenic climate change. This highlights the need for more holistic risk assessments of flood affected regions. Flood risk assessments (FRAs) are used to inform decision makers and stakeholders when creating mitigation and adaptation strategies for at-risk communities. When assessing flood risk, previous FRAs from Australiaâ€™s most flood prone regions were generally focused on the flood hazard itself, and rarely considering flood vulnerability (FV). This study assessed FV in one of Australiaâ€™s most flood prone regionsâ€”the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment, and investigated indicator-based approaches as a proxy method for Australian FV assessment instead of hydrological modelling. Four indicators were selected with the intention of representing environmental and socio-economic characteristics: elevation, degree of slope, index of relative socio-economic disadvantage (IRSD), and hydrologic soil groups (HSGs). It was found that combination of low elevation, low degree of slope, low IRSD score, and very-low infiltration soils resulted in very high levels of vulnerability. FV was shown to be at its highest in the Hawkesbury-Nepean valley flood plain region on the outskirts of Greater Western Sydney, particularly in Blacktown, Penrith, and Liverpool. This actionable risk data which resulted from the final FV index supported the practicality and serviceability of the proxy indicator-based approach. The developed methodology for FV assessment is replicable and has the potential to help inform decision makers of flood-prone communities in Australia, particularly in data scarce areas."
"Reporting of Corporate Social Responsibility in Central Public Sector Enterprises: A Study of Post Mandatory Regime in India Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative This paper explores the level of corporate social responsibility (CSR) contributions disclosed by central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) in India. This paper analyses the nature and quality of CSR disclosures (CSRDs) made by CPSEs listed in India following the issue of CSR guidelines by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) for CPSEs in March 2010. The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of CSR guidelines on the reporting practices of the CPSEs. A content analysis of annual reports across seven themes shows that Human Resources (HR) and Community Development are the prime focus areas of CSR disclosures, whereas Carbon and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are the least reported activity. The disclosures across all CSR themes are primarily narrative rather than quantitative or in monetary terms. The findings of the study may help policy makers in India to assess practices and devise detailed and specific CSRD requirements, rather than the current general mandatory requirements, to enhance the performance and quality of CSRDs by the CPSEs."

"Sensitivity of a Large and Representative Sample of Antarctic Marine Invertebrates to Metals Toxicity; Aquatic Organisms; Environmental Assessment There are limited data on the sensitivity to contaminants of marine organisms in polar regions. Consequently, assessments of the risk of contaminants to marine biota in polar environments typically include extrapolations from temperate and/or tropical species. This is problematic because the taxonomic composition of organisms differs between polar and temperate/tropical waters, and both the toxicity of chemicals and the physiology of organisms are very different at the stable low temperatures experienced in polar marine systems. Collecting high-quality sensitivity data for a wide range of marine polar organisms using traditional toxicity assessment approaches is a time-consuming and difficult process, especially in remote and hostile environments. We applied a rapid toxicity testing approach, which allowed a much larger number of species to be tested than would be possible with traditional toxicity test methods, albeit with lower replications and fewer exposure concentrations. With this rapid approach, sensitivity estimates are less precise, but more numerous. This is important when constructing species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), which aim to represent the sensitivity of communities. We determined the approximate sensitivity (4- and 10-d median lethal concentration [LC50] values) of a large and representative sample of Antarctic marine invertebrates to copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd). Up to 88 LC50 values (from 88 different taxa) were used in the construction of SSDs. The hazardous concentrations for 1% of taxa (HC1) based on 10-d LC50 values were 37, 346, and 792 Î¼g/L for Cu, Zn, and Cd, respectively. Our results provide a basis for estimating the risk of exposure to metals for a large representative sample of marine polar invertebrates. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1560â€“1568. Â© 2019 SETAC."
"The cultural power metric: Toward a reputational analysis of China’s soft power in the Asia-Pacific Anime; China; Korean Cinema The advent of new media technologies has changed how people watch, engage with, and share digital media. Conventionally, audiences were surveyed selectively, and the results were collated by professional agencies and often kept confidential. However, the conspicuous ratings given to media and cultural products outside their country of origin and their very public success and failure raises questions about the validity of such methods, particularly at a time when media and cultural products are used as proxies for cultural â€œsoft power.â€ This term, first used by Joseph Nye in a political context, evokes reputational impact: a particular nationâ€™s cultural and media products can â€œgo globalâ€ if they prove sufficiently popular, reflecting positively on the originating nation. This article examines the various methods used to evaluate Chinaâ€™s â€œcultural power.â€ It notes the current weighting given to the humanities and social sciences. By applying some basic big data analysis and machine-learning techniques, the authors build on previous studies by offering new insights into the rise of â€œDigital Chinaâ€ and Chinaâ€™s digital and Internet trailblazers. The authors consider two major international metrics, as well as Chinaâ€™s early experimental attempts at devising its own standard, before introducing an alternative model, the cultural power metric."
"Hidden in Plain Sight: Building Visibility for Critical Gender Perspectives Exploring Markets, Marketing and Society Marketing; Consumer Culture; Netnography In this introduction to the special issue on gender and macromarketing, we explore how gender research within the journal has remained â€œhidden in plain sightâ€; and, offer concrete proposals to build visibility for critical gender perspectives which explore markets, marketing and society. This introduction is divided into four sections. First, we examine existing research in the journal which has focused on gender. Next, we provide a summary of the eight articles published in this special issue. We then examine systemic gender inequalities and injustices currently evidenced within macromarketing. Finally, we proffer suggestions for future gender research directions within the journal, alongside our reflections on addressing the problematic gendered dynamics that persist within the journal and the Macromarketing Society."

"Life cycle assessment to compare the environmental impact of seven contemporary food waste management systems Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste Municipal food waste (FW) represents 35â€“45% of household residual waste in Australia, with the nation generating 1.6 Tg annually. It is estimated that 91% of this FW ends up in landfill. This study used life cycle assessment to determine and compare the environmental impact of seven contemporary FW management systems for two real-life jurisdictions; incorporating the complete waste service and expanding the system to include inert and garden waste. Although, no system exhibited a best ranking across all impact categories, FW digestion based systems were all revealed to have a lower global warming potential than composting and landfilling systems. Mechanical biological treatment, anaerobic co-digestion, and home composting all demonstrated the lowest environmental impacts for two or more of the environmental impact categories assessed. The assessment included market and technological specific variables and uncertainties providing a framework for robust decision making at a municipality level."
