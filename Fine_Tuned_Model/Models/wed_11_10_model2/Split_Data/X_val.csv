"In-plane impact behavior of 3D-printed auxetic stainless honeycombs Negative; Honeycomb Cores; Metamaterials In order to fully comprehend dynamic responses of metallic auxetic honeycombs, drop hammer impact tests and corresponding finite element (FE) analyses were conducted. The three-dimensional (3D) printing technology was adopted to manufacture stainless steel specimens with varying cell side length-to-thickness ratios and cell configurations. The specimens were crushed under three distinct energy inputs, and the deforming process and relevant mechanical parameters, e.g., the Poisson's ratio, failure mode, plateau stress and energy absorption capacity were studied. The FE results can generally compare well with the experimental ones and facilitate clarifying the impact mechanisms of the experimental results. Improvements of the auxetic specimens in energy absorption were verified through comparison with that of the corresponding convex honeycomb. The results reveal that the specimen with an auxetic honeycomb has higher plateau stress and specific energy absorption with less deformation when the geometric size is the same. A small side length-to-thickness ratio and input impact energy can lead to greatly improved energy absorption efficiency."
"Steps to solving the infant biometric problem with ridge-based biometrics Facial Recognition; Biometry; Plastic Surgery The pressing infant biometric problem is to find a biometric means to identify infants cheaply, reliably, and automatically. Physical traits of infants are tiny, delicate, and grow rapidly. The authors focus on a novel area of friction-ridge skin as a potential answer: the ball under the big toe. The ballprint is readily accessible, with more features and larger ridges than a fingerprint. The authors followed 54 newborns for 2 years, capturing their ballprints with an adult fingerprint scanner within 3 days of birth, at 2 months, at 6 months, and at 2 years. The authors show the growth of the ballprint is isotropic rather than affine during infancy. The isotropic growth rate from birth can be measured by the change in inter-ridge spacing, which the authors show precisely mirrors change in physical length from birth, as recorded by World Health Organisation for large, diverse infant populations. From 2 months of age, by using isotropic scaling to compensate for growth, the authors successfully matched good quality images with 0% equal error rate using existing adult fingerprint technology, even for captures 22 months apart. These findings flag the value of ballprints as a practical means of infant identification, by themselves, or together or sequentially with other biometrics."
"Motivational appetites, cultural orientations and accounting students' learning Accounting Education; Accountants; Competency We examine the effect of cognitive and cultural factors on student learning in undergraduate accounting courses. Using survey data relating to mainstream course activities and assessment tasks, we find that the â€˜motivational appetiteâ€™ concepts of liking and wanting, along with â€˜cultural orientationâ€™ of vertical-collectivism and horizontal-individualism exhibit a significant joint effect on student learning. Motivational appetite has a statistically significant main effect while cultural orientation exhibits only a joint effect. This result suggests that while cognitive processes transcend cultural influence, the latter affects students' learning through their interaction with cognitive factors. Implications for accounting course design are discussed."

"A decision support system for prioritised COVID-19 two-dosage vaccination allocation and distribution COVID-19; Human Influenza; Epidemic Model This study proposes a decision support system (DSS) that integrates GIS, analytics, and simulation methods to help develop a priority-based distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in a large urban setting. The methodology applies novel hierarchical heuristic-simulation procedures to create a holistic algorithm for prioritising the process of demand allocation and optimising vaccine distribution. The Melbourne metropolitan area in Australia with a population of over five million is used as a case study. Three vaccine supply scenarios, namely limited, excessive, and disruption, were formulated to operationalise a two-dose vaccination program. Vaccine distribution with hard constraints were simulated and then further validated with sensitivity analyses. The results show that vaccines can be prioritised to society's most vulnerable segments and distributed using the current logistics network with 10 vehicles. Compared with other vaccine distribution plans with no prioritisation, such as equal allocation of vaccines to local government areas based on population size or one on a first-come-first-serve basis, the plans generated by the proposed DSS ensure prioritised vaccination of the most needed and vulnerable population. The aim is to curb the spread of the infection and reduce mortality rate more effectively. They also achieve vaccination of the entire population with less logistical resources required. As such, this study contributes to knowledge and practice in pandemic vaccine distribution and enables governments to make real-time decisions and adjustments in daily distribution plans. In this way any unforeseen disruptions in the vaccine supply chain can be coped with."
"Examining the need for HR analytics to better manage and mitigate incidents of violence against nurses and personal care assistants in aged care Workplace Violence; Nurses; Aggression In this study we argue that human resource (HR) analytics is critical to examine the interconnectedness between human resource management and human capital. The focus is on HR in the aged care sector and the employment, performance management and retention of nursing and personal care assistant staff. What HR fails to achieve in the aged care sector is to protect staff against violence in the workplace. We argue it is time for HR to immerse activities into analysing employee-related data and supporting nursing staff against violence at work. The findings indicate through HR analytics there are innovative opportunities that can enhance human capital, but they require a thorough analysis of relevant data that will make a difference to an individual's work experiences and performance. An important part of HR analytics is to ensure the quality of data input and expert use of qualitative data to investigate, analyse and find solutions to resolve workplace violence issues."

"A new strategy in the search for treatments for early onset preeclampsia Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious disorder of human pregnancy characterized by new onset hypertension and maternal organ dysfunction in the 2nd
half of gestation. Early onset PE (EPE) occurs before 34 weeks of gestation and is the most dangerous form, often accompanied by fetal growth
restriction due to placental insufficiency. EPE has life-threatening and lifelong consequences for both the mother and baby. Despite its severity
and long term impacts, there is still no effective way to treat EPE other than premature delivery. The reason for the lack of therapies is partly due
to the complexity of the syndrome, and partly because the underlying causes are not well understood."

"Leveraging endogenous climate resilience: urban adaptation in Pacific Small Island Developing States Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Pacific Small Island Developing States are often referred to as the â€œfrontlineâ€ of climate change, facing an array of worsening climate-related shocks and stressors. However, despite their underlying exposure to climate change impacts, the role of Pacific Island cities as both an avenue for adaptation and sites of climate vulnerability is often overlooked. This paper reflects on two ongoing participatory action research projects conducted by UN-Habitat and research partners from Australian universities in Honiara, Solomon Islands, and Port Vila, Vanuatu. Findings from community consultations across 16 communities in these settings demonstrate the critical role of endogenous modes of resilience, as well as the strong correlation between these spaces and sub-city climate vulnerability. Cross-scale integration with climate resilience planning processes is then used to examine points of conflict between stakeholder interpretations of core functions within socioecological systems, demonstrating the importance of considering values and conflict within urban climate adaptation."

"A parsimonious approach to mapping climate-change-related composite disaster risk at the local scale in coastal Bangladesh Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Climate-change-induced disaster risks impede sustainable development goals in many developing countries. With the prevailing climate change conditions, environmental events are likely to become even more pervasive. Coastal regions, the source of numerous tangible and intangible benefits for human populations, are exposed to a wide range of risks. With the motivation that knowledge of risk at local levels could bring substantial benefits for risk reduction planning, the current study devised a framework for mapping composite disaster risk at the local scale using context-specific risk variables and tested it within a clearly defined coastal sub-district of southwestern Bangladesh. Utilizing easily accessible spatial and non-spatial secondary datasets, a risk map for the study area was formulated using geospatial techniques. The map revealed that within a small area of about 230 km2, the disaster risk varied considerably, which is attributable to the variability of geographic and socio-demographic features of the area. The map delineated 21% of the study area as very high risk, 20% as high, 21% as moderate, 20% as low, and 18% as very low risk. The technique for risk mapping adopted in this study is inexpensive to conduct, doable within a brief period, requires limited data inputs and is thus useable for countries like Bangladesh that have a dearth of data. The resulting map is an improvement over existing risk maps, which are currently available only at the regional scale, and hence provides a robust platform upon which to commence the process of disaster risk reduction in the area."

"What Stratum Are You? Narratives of Colombian Migrants Living in Melbourne and How They Experience Socioeconomic Stratification Transnationalism; Human Migration; Dual Citizenship This article explores the stories of eleven middle-class professionals from BogotÃ¡, Colombia living in Melbourne, Australia. They reflect on class and status while trying to navigate the Australian social structure and position themselves and others in it. Drawing on theories of migration and class, we argue that the participants position themselves in Australian society not only in relation to the local social structure but also through beliefs they have about Colombian social structures, particularly the socioeconomic stratification system. This involves reinterpretation and adaptation of pre-conceptions and beliefs according to the new reality. Further unexpected findings included that English proficiency is crucial to the social mobility and integration of Colombian migrants in Australia. Most respondents perceived education as their best asset, but felt that their chances of success depended on English skills. This research contributes to knowledge of Latin American migrants in Australia and the Colombian socioeconomic stratification system."

"Emerging sustainable solutions for depollution: Geopolymers Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali Air pollution and water pollution are critical issues because they negatively affect ecosystem and human health, as well as affecting buildings and industries. Utilizing photocatalysts that rely on light irradiation to decompose pollutants is a promising solution to this issue. Geopolymers, when used as a green substitute for cement and other engineered materials, can be synthesized using different agricultural and industrial wastes. These materials exhibit synergies in the depollution process and can be regarded as cost effective and novel in the context of removing organic pollution from water and air to protect and improve the environment. Geopolymer catalytic performance is closely linked to the composition, microstructure, and preparation method of the geopolymer. This review investigates the types of geopolymers and catalysts and their corresponding preparation methods and performances. The limitations of these products and future works are also detailed."

"The Role of Biochar in Sustainable Agriculture, and Climate Change Mitigation for Sustainable Cities Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Sustainable development is facing a transformation. One solution finding its place as a key strategy in a number of sustainable development goal areas is biochar. Biochar is a geo-engineered bi-product that is similar in appearance to charcoal which differs from charcoal in that the organic biomass waste from which it is created is heated in an enclosed chamber to low temperatures and deprived of oxygen. This paper investigates the latest studies in crop productivity, commercial viabilities, and the socio-economic options of biochar production at a local and international level in the pursuit of sustainability and climate change mitigation. In terms of sustainability the uptake of biochar as a model for sustainable agriculture is steadily gaining momentum due to its agronomic potential for crop yields, organic soil carbon, carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The economic viability of biochar production varies markedly around the world. The most promising opportunities for soil carbon sequestration have derived from voluntary carbon markets and government initiatives such as Australiaâ€™s Emissions Reduction Fund. The scheme promoted the integration of biochar in land use management practices at a farm scale. If biochar is to have a more profound impact on a global scale, then countries need to adopt a sustainable biochar strategy which is universal along with standardised sustainability protocols."

"‘Two different worlds’: Papua New Guinean women working in development in Port Moresby Papua New Guinea; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Masculinity This article examines the lives of Port Moresby women who work in the development sector of Papua New Guinea. In particular, it demonstrates how development discourse structures the very fabric of working relationships within this sector in Port Moresby. Underpinned by neocolonial geographies in which those in the global north rescue those in the global south, these discourses produce workplaces in which Papua New Guinean women are seen as lacking the moral and technical capacities to run development projects in their own country. The article argues that the privileges held by expatriates and denied to local women, in conjunction with the workplace discrimination to which they are subjected, ironically undermine the development sector's supposed commitment to promoting gender equality in Papua New Guinea."
"Early menopause after Breast Cancer:  implementation research using the experiences and perspectives of women and health professionals to translate evidence into practice (admin by Monash; NBCF) Early menopause (menopause before age 45 years), occurs spontaneously or secondary to medical treatments, especially after cancer diagnosis, and affects more than 10% of women1, 2. Early menopause (EM) is associated with significant morbidity, increased mortality and negative impact on quality of life1. EM stakeholders involved in this partnership recognise both consumer and health professional knowledge gaps regarding EM and the need for evidence based resources around EM. These knowledge gaps contribute to delayed diagnosis, variation in management, dissatisfaction with care, non-compliance with cancer treatment, poor risk perception and poorer outcomes."
"Gαq Is the Specific Mediator of PAR-1 Transactivation of Kinase Receptors in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells Low Density Lipoprotein; Proteoglycan; Atherogenesis Aims: G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) transactivation of kinase receptors greatly expands the actions attributable to GPCRs. Thrombin, via its cognate GPCR, protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1, transactivates tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase receptors, specifically the epidermal growth factor receptor and transforming growth factor-Î² receptor, respectively. PAR-1 transactivation-dependent signalling leads to the modification of lipid-binding proteoglycans involved in the retention of lipids and the development of atherosclerosis. The mechanisms of GPCR transactivation of kinase receptors are distinct. We aimed to investigate the role of proximal G proteins in transactivation-dependent signalling. Main Methods: Using pharmacological and molecular approaches, we studied the role of the Gâº subunits, Gâºq and Gâº11, in the context of PAR-1 transactivation-dependent signalling leading to proteoglycan modifications. Key Findings: Pan Gâºq subunit inhibitor UBO-QIC/FR900359 inhibited PAR-1 transactivation of kinase receptors and proteoglycans modification. The Gâºq/11 inhibitor YM254890 did not affect PAR-1 transactivation pathways. Molecular approaches revealed that of the two highly homogenous Gâºq members, Gâºq and Gâº11, only the Gâºq was involved in regulating PAR-1 mediated proteoglycan modification. Although Gâºq and Gâº11 share approximately 90% homology at the protein level, we show that the two isoforms exhibit different functional roles. Significance: Our findings may be extrapolated to other GPCRs involved in vascular pathology and highlight the need for novel pharmacological tools to assess the role of G proteins in GPCR signalling to expand the preeminent position of GPCRs in human therapeutics."
"AI-enabled sub-ppb NO2 and NH3 biomarker gas detection in agriculture crops for precision and smart farming. (Candidate: Van Ham Ha) Gas sensors are essential in several industries such as agricultural, biomedical, manufacturing, petroleum
industry, among others. In precision agriculture, food wastage is a severe issue which in 2017 had an
estimated loss of $20B to the Australian economy.[1] According to the National Food Waste Baseline
Report (2019), 25% of produce is estimated never to leave the farm, costing Australian farmers $2.84B
annually.[2] Food wastage can also occur at other stages, such as manufacturing, storage, and supply chain.
NO2 and NH3 biomarkers exerted by the fresh produce can determine the quality of the produce before
spoilage. These biomarkers measured in sub-part-per-billion (ppb) can provide crucial information about
the produce's condition as an early detection tool for efficient produce management throughout the supply
chain. However, achieving the biomarker detection in sub-ppb range requires costly specialised
instruments that are non-economical in large-scale agriculture."
"Assessment of social-economic risk of Chinese dual land use system using fuzzy AHP China; Dewatering; Confined Aquifer The Chinese dual land use system (DLUS) has played a crucial role in the industrialization of China since 1950s. However, this dual system caused/causes obstacles in urban development under the new market economic conditions. This paper presents an approach to assess the social-economic risks during urban development in China by integrating the strategic environment assessment (SEA) principle into the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. In the proposed approach, SEA principles are set as the influencing factors in AHP. Fuzzy AHP is used to assess the relative importance degree of the six principles in SEA. To illustrate the application procedure of the proposed approach, a building collapse incident inWenzhou is used as a case for the risk analysis. The assessment results show that the index of the manage system has the greatest importance to social-economic risk. The principle of sustainable development (A) and monitoring measures (E) have more importance than the other principles in SEA. It can be concluded that the DLUS in the market management of China may be responsible for building collapse incidents in rural areas. It is suggested that the principles of sustainable development and monitoring measures in SEA should be strictly implemented during urbanization, and it is recommended that the government establish a unified management system and ensure the effective implementation of sustainable urbanization."
"Urban Heat Island and Mitigation in Tropical India Heat Islands; Land Surface Temperature; Land Cover Urban heat island (UHI) studies using ground-based observations are limited in the tropical cities of India. This chapter reviews the UHI studies in the tropical cities located in the southern and central states of the subcontinent, namely Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra. In tropical cities that experience high latent heat fluxes, the thermal environments are also affected by the heterogenous nature of urban settings. Majority of the UHI studies were conducted for a short period using either non-standard stations or mobile surveys, or a combination of these, with the reported UHI intensities ranging from 1.76 to 4.6 Â°C. Comparison between studies are difficult due to the variation in the methodology and the way results are presented. Ground-based measurements deployed in both micro and macro scales informed by high resolution remote sensing outputs will help to address the gap in the current knowledge. Dense network of stations installed using crowd sourcing approach are proven to be beneficial if uncertainties are carefully addressed. This chapter also discusses the application of UHI mitigation strategies established in similar climatic conditions and land use patterns. Mitigation actions including tree planting, use of appropriate materials as well as enhancing ventilation should be carefully chosen according to the geometry and orientation of the streets."

"Fast and Highly Sensitive Detection of Pathogens Wreathed with Magnetic Nanoparticles Using Dark-Field Microscopy Cryptosporidium; Animals; Oocysts Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) is a highly potent zoonotic pathogen, which can do significant harm to both human beings and livestock. However, existing technologies or methods are deficient for rapid on-site detection of water contaminated with C. parvum. Better detection approaches are needed to allow water management agencies to stop major breakouts of the pathogen. Herein, we present a novel detection method for cryptosporidium in a tiny drop of sample using a magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) probe combined with dark-field microscopy in 30 min. The designed MNP probes bind with high affinity to C. parvum, resulting in the formation of a golden garland-like structure under dark-field microscopy. This MNP-based dark-field counting strategy yields an amazing PCR-like sensitivity of 8 attomolar (aM) (5 pathogens in 1 Î¼L). Importantly, the assay is very rapid (-30 min) and is very simple to perform as it involves only one step of mixing and magnetic separation, followed by dropping on a slide for counting under dark-field microscope. By combining the advantages of the specific light-scattering characteristic of MNP probe under dark field and the selective magnetic separation ability of functionalized MNP, the proposed MNP-based dark-field enumeration method offers low cost and significant translational potential."

"Compensation for land use deprivation in mining: an analysis of the laws and practices relating to land use deprivation compensation in Ghana’s mining sector Niger; Oil; Haram This article examines the laws and valuation methods that valuers apply in assessing compensation for land use deprivation in Ghanaâ€™s mining sector using two mining companies as case studies. We argue that analysing the valuation techniques applied in assessing compensation for land use deprivation in the context of current legal provisions facilitates a better understanding of the issues fuelling community dissatisfaction with compensation awards. Data pro-duced through document analysis and interviews with 39 farmers, government officials, chiefs, private valuers, and officials of Newmont Goldcorpâ€™s Ahafo Mine and Asanko Gold Ghana Limited were analysed in the context of the current legal framework for expropriation. Interview transcripts were coded based on themes and analysed using the constant comparison method. The findings reveal that the valuation techniques for assessing compensation for land use deprivation disregard fundamental compensation principles outlined under law. The study also exposes the weaknesses in the valuation techniques in assessing compensation for farmlands that mining may impair permanently. Towards ensuring fairness in compensating mining-impacted farmers, this study recommends additional legal directives to streamline the methods for assessing compensation for land use deprivation. The consequences of the limitations in the valuation methods on expropriated farmers are also discussed."

"Vernacular human security and moris diak in timor-leste: A social contract between the living and spirit actants Timor-Leste; Post-Independence; Peacebuilding The concept of human security argues that the improvement of peopleâ€™s wellbeing and livelihoods is a vital component in the stability of the state. What happens, however, when the state is not viewed as the only (if at all) source of influence on peopleâ€™s everyday security? This article argues for a particular vernacular of human security that recognizes a social contract between the living with spirit actants, in ways that can often compete with or challenge state-building efforts. In Timor-Leste, ancestral spirits (matebian sira) can directly intervene in the physical safety of their living descendants, and livelihoods (in terms of food security) often depends on engagement between the living and their ancestors as well as nature spirits (rai-nain-sira)."

"Emerging investigator series: Phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater by adsorption on steelmaking slag preceding forward osmosis: An integrated process Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption Phosphorus is a critical non-renewable mineral essential for sustainable crop production. However, it is a primary cause of eutrophication in natural water bodies. Hence, a pragmatic approach that allows wastewater treatment plants to efficiently recover phosphorus from wastewater is needed. In this study, we investigated phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater using an industrial waste product (steelmaking slag) as an adsorbent to selectively separate phosphorus from wastewater before its concentration by the forward osmosis (FO) process. Phosphorus adsorbed on slag was extracted, thereby regenerating the adsorbent medium. The resulting phosphorus-rich solution was further enriched by FO prior to chemical precipitation for phosphorus recovery. Batch test results showed that the equilibrium of phosphorus sorption on the slag medium was achieved within 45 min with an adsorption capacity of 3.8 mg g-1. In continuous-flow column tests, the slag exhibited a stable phosphorus removal efficiency of 82% from wastewater, following which approximately 88% of the phosphate could be extracted from the adsorbent medium. When the phosphorus-rich solution extracted from the adsorbent was passed through the FO membrane, FO could retain 98% of the phosphate. However, the water flux through the FO membrane declined gradually to approximately 20% of the initial value at a water recovery of 90%, which could be attributed to the increasingly concentrated feed solution. The enrichment of phosphate in the concentrated feed by the FO process provided a favorable condition for spontaneous precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphate. This study demonstrates that the proposed combined adsorption-FO process can effectively remove, and thus recover, phosphorus from municipal wastewater."

"Public Knowledge and Perception of Drinking Water Quality and Its Health Implications: An Example from the Makueni County, South-Eastern Kenya Dental Fluorosis; Fluoridation; Drinking Water Due to the semi-arid nature of Makueni County in South-Eastern Kenya, there is a high dependence on groundwater resources for domestic use. Reliance on this source of potable water may have health implications for the population, given the presence of several naturally occurring and potentially harmful elements reported from aquifer source rocks, soil, and water in the area. A survey involving questionnaires and focus group discussions (FGDs) was conducted with 115 individuals to determine the local populationâ€™s knowledge, attitude, and perceptions of their drinking water quality and its health impacts. The results show that most respondents (67%) preferred piped water because it was pre-treated and not saline. Only 29% of the respondents were very satisfied with the taste of their drinking water, while the rest complained about varying salinity levels, ranging from slightly salty to very salty. This low satisfaction might have influenced the low daily drinking water consumption (1â€“2 L) by most respondents. Health issues reported by many (43%) respondents in the area include diarrhoea and gastrointestinal upsets, which may be associated with the saline nature of the drinking water. Elevated fluoride (Fâˆ’) in the local groundwater was reported, and the health effects remain a concern. Although 91% knew someone with dental fluorosis, 53% did not know the deleterious effects of high Fâˆ’ in drinking water. Most respondents (59%) associated the salty nature of the water with dental fluorosis, and as a result, 48% avoided drinking the salty water to prevent the condition. Despite the high prevalence and known psycho-social effects, most people did not perceive dental fluorosis as a severe health threat. The increased health risks associated with high salinity and high Fâˆ’ in drinking water in Makueni County are poorly understood by most residents, regardless of their education, gender, or age. This warrants an immediate public health education programme and detailed epidemiological studies to determine all the health effects associated with naturally occurring, potentially harmful elements in groundwater in the area."

"Manufacturing capital utilisation, firm dynamics and wage inequality Economics; Unskilled Labour; Urban Unemployment This paper examines the short- and long-run effects of manufacturing capital utilisation on income distribution and social welfare of an economy. A rise in manufacturing capital utilisation lowers the effective cost of capital. This increases the demand for capital in the urban sector, which raises firm output and profitability but reduces the availability of capital in the rural sector. Unskilled wage is lowered. Thus, a rise in manufacturing capital utilisation increases income inequality in the short run. In the long run, due to the firm-entry effect, a rise in manufacturing capital utilisation further exacerbates the inequality situation. Empirical analysis confirms the theoretical findings. In particular, a one per cent increase in manufacturing capital utilisation leads to about 0.58% increase in income inequality, of which the contribution from the firm-entry effect is about 28%."

"Preparation and properties of micro-nano polyacrylonitrile/sheath-core polyethylene-polypropylene bicomponent fiber multilayer composite filters Air Filters; Electrospinning; Nanofibers Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers were fabricated by electrospinning and collected on sheath-core polyethylene-polypropylene (PE-PP) bicomponent microfiber web to prepare PAN/PE-PP monolayer composite fiber webs. Then several monolayer composite webs were stacked and strengthened by thermal bonding to prepare PAN/PE-PP multilayer composite filters. The effects of the number of layers of PAN/PE-PP composite webs and electrospinning time on the pore size and the filtration performance were studied. The results show that the pore size parameters of multilayer composite materials are similar with that of monolayer composite material, but the pore structures of the two materials are different. At the same total areal density and total electrospinning time, when the number of layers of PAN/PE-PP composite webs is more than 10, the filtration efficiency and quality factor QF of PAN/PE-PP multilayer composite filters are significantly larger than that of PAN/PE-PP monolayer composite filter, and the resistance is increased slightly. Compared with PAN/PE-PP monolayer composite filter, the filtration efficiency of 20 layers of PAN/PE-PP composite filter to â‰¥0.3 Î¼m particles is increased by 33%, the resistance is increased by 5 Pa, and the QF is increased by 30%. At the same total areal density and number of layers, when the electrospinning time is prolonged to more than 210 min, the filtration efficiency of 20 layers of PAN/PE-PP composite filter can be increased to more than 90%, but the resistance also increases sharply, hence the filtration performance of 20 layers of PAN/PE-PP composite filter with electrospinning time of 210 min is the best. Therefore, compared with PAN/PE-PP monolayer composite filter with the same areal density, the filtration performance of PAN/PE-PP multilayer composite filters is obviously improved. The micro-nano fiber multilayer composite method is an effective method to prepare high efficiency and low resistance composite air filters."

"Feedback-Linearization-Based Direct Power Control of DFIG Wind Turbine Systems Under Unbalanced Grid Voltage Asynchronous Generators; Powerpoint; Energy Conversion In this paper, a power control strategy based on feedback linearization (FL) control has been proposed at the rotor-side converter (RSC) of the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine system under unbalanced grid voltage. With this method, the nonlinear model is linearized, not by small signal analysis, which makes it simpler to design the controllers. Furthermore, the oscillations of active power and generator torque can be much reduced.

"Five lessons to guide more effective biodiversity conservation message framing Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Climate Change; Skepticism Communication and advocacy approaches that influence attitudes and behaviors are key to addressing conservation problems, and the way an issue is framed can affect how people view, judge, and respond to an issue. Responses to conservation interventions can also be influenced by subtle wording changes in statements that may appeal to different values, activate social norms, influence a person's affect or mood, or trigger certain biases, each of which can differently influence the resulting engagement, attitudes, and behavior. We contend that by strategically considering how conservation communications are framed, they can be made more effective with little or no additional cost. Key framing considerations include, emphasizing things that matter to the audience, evoking helpful social norms, reducing psychological distance, leveraging useful biases, and, where practicable, testing messages. These lessons will help communicators think strategically about how to frame messages for greater effect."
"Semianalytical Solution to Near-Field Temperature in Nuclear Waste Repository Bentonite; Montmorillonite; Radioactive Wastes The temperature field in a nuclear waste repository is an important issue with regard to the design and safety assessment of the repository. In this paper, a double-layer model for simulating the heat conduction near a single waste canister is established, and then, by applying the Laplace transform to the governing equations of the heat conduction in the buffer layer and the surrounding rock, the solutions of the temperature field are obtained in the Laplace domain. The temperature distribution near the nuclear waste canister is presented by numerical inversion of the solutions using Crumpâ€™s method in the time-space domain. Finally, the effects of parameters on the temperature on the canister surface are analyzed. The results show that the double-layer model of the heat conduction increases the maximum temperature on the canister surface by about 11.87Â°C compared to the single-layer model. The double-layer model is verified to be reliable by comparing with a line heat source model that has been verified by numerical calculations. The temperature on the canister surface is significantly affected by the burnup value and cooling time of the nuclear waste, the thickness of the buffer layer, the thermal conductivities of the buffer material and the surrounding rock, and the external boundary condition."
"Improving community fire management and peat land restoration in Indonesia (Student: Amanda Sinclair) This project aims to support the biophysical and social transition that will need to occur
for effective and equitable restoration of this peatland, and ensure the continued
wellbeing of the communities that are dependent on it. This project will combine
analysis of field measurements of biophysical and biogeochemical processes,
conceptual, visual and mathematical modelling, and a social science approach to
address three specific questions:
1. How do peat soil characteristics change as natural peat is drained, burnt, and
rewet, and how do these characteristics impact on agricultural system
production?
2. How can management of water and nutrients maximise productivity and returns
to farmers in the new agricultural systems on the rewet peat?
3. What is the social acceptance of the proposed agricultural systems in a rewet
peat?

"Bio/hydrochar Sorbents for Environmental Remediation Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon A rising global population and aspirational higher living standards has driven a step change in resource utilization and concomitant anthropogenic pollution across the biosphere. Low-cost and scalable technologies for environmental remediation are therefore urgently sought, with an emphasis on trash-to-treasure strategies that exploit abundant but underutilized waste by-products of existing sectors. Biochars are carbon-rich, porous solids produced by biomass pyrolysis under anaerobic or oxygen-scarce conditions at high temperature (350â€“700 Â°C), while hydrochars are produced by hydrothermal biomass carbonization at lower temperature (130â€“250 Â°C) and high autogenous pressures (0.3â€“4.0 MPa). Bio/hydrochars possess unique physicochemical properties, notably high surface areas (100â€“1500 m2 gâˆ’1) and porosity (0.25â€“2.5 cm3 gâˆ’1) and rich surface chemistry featuring carboxylic, phenolic, hydroxyl, and carbonyl functions, amenable to chemical, physical, or biochemical modification, rendering them ideal sorbents for pollutants such as heavy metals (e.g. As and Cr), and toxic organic (e.g., dyes and xenobiotics) and inorganic (e.g., SO2) molecules. Bio/hydrochars are attractive for environmental remediation of pollutant mixtures by surface complexation, redox chemistry, electrostatic interactions/ion exchange, or co-precipitation. This review discusses recent opportunities and challenges in creating bio/hydrochar sorbents and their nanocomposites through grafting, doping, and chemical/physical activation, for the depollution of aquatic and atmospheric environments."
"Future past i am a coolie-al…and i reside as an invisible island inside the ocean: Tidalectics, transoceanic crossings, coolitude and a tamil identity Malaysia; British Malaya; Islam The politics of Tamil working-class identity in Malaysia continue to be articulated in subaltern terms, employing term such as â€˜coolieâ€™, which is elsewhere an archaic usage from colonial days. Yet the power of the coolie narrative appears salient, and the coolie odyssey is far from over. Drawing upon the authorâ€™s longitudinal work with a Tamil squatter settlement in the heart of the city of Kuala Lumpur in the Malay Archipelago, this paper moves from third to first and then second narrative to capture the broad range of ruptures and transformations of Tamil sensibilities, a â€˜coolitudeâ€™ that grew a pattern of life which emerged from a journey that began on the sea. In this article, the author envisions the â€˜black oceanâ€™ as an invisible island; shaped by colonial and imperial histories, racial capitalism and ocean crossings. These transoceanic crossings carried the weight of Tamil histories, rooted in the seas as an invisible islandâ€”as both the rupture of an identity and a translation from western namings and discourses. What remains is the â€˜islandâ€™, rooted in the seas as a colonial wound of history, a tidalectic between transoceanic migration, personhood and language. This community is more than just its resilience, its assertions of power, its affair with identity and belonging, and its response to deep social inequalities in its homeland. It is also a space of a poetics of resoluteness to recover an identity that is not fractured, not alienated from place and transoceanic crossings. This paper attempts a retelling of a hidden hyphen that held the labourer and the personhood apart, but also together. It navigates through the concept of tidalectics first postulated by Barbadian poet and historian Kamau Braithwaite (2003) in conjunction with Valentine Danielâ€™s (2008) The Coolie and Khal Torabullyâ€™s (1992) Coolitude. The paper seeks to understand more deeply the performativity of the hyphen as an invisible island inside the ocean."

"Targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling by microRNAs as a therapeutic approach in chemoresistant osteosarcoma Osteosarcoma; MicroRNAs; Microrna Osteosarcoma (OS) is an adolescent and young adult malignancy that mostly occurs in long bones. The treatment of OS is still a big challenge for clinicians due to increasing chemoresistance, and many efforts are being made today to find more beneficial treatments. In this regard, the use of microRNAs has shown a high capacity to develop promising therapies. By targeting cancer-involved signaling pathways, microRNAs reduce the cellular level of these protein pathways; thereby reducing the growth and invasion of tumors, and even leading cancer cells to apoptosis. One of these oncogenic pathways that play an important role in OS development and can be targeted by microRNAs is the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Hence, the first goal of this review article is to explain the cross-talk of microRNAs and the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in OS and then discussing recent findings of the use of microRNAs as a therapeutic approach in OS."

"Taking scientific inventions to market: Mapping the academic entrepreneurship ecosystem Entrepreneurial University; Academic Entrepreneurship; Innovation The active contribution of academic institutions to the technological, social and economic development of societies is of increasing importance. To better understand this contribution, we present a systematic review, together with bibliometric and network analyses of the academic entrepreneurship literature. This provides a map of the main topics approached by scholars, thereby illustrating the scientific scenario of the field. Our findings identify three highly interconnected research activity domains that characterize the multidimensional features of entrepreneurship in the academic setting, as well as a significant gap in the literature regarding studies evaluating approaches to support the navigation of potential scientific discoveries to the market. We organize our findings into a four stages framework consisting of: idea inception; the recognition of how this idea unlocks value for customers and other stakeholders; development of an innovative business model; and a commercialization strategy that creates real impact. We discuss the relevance of each stage for the establishment of a more innovation-friendly environment and conclude by offering perspectives into future research opportunities and by encouraging studies that consider the academic entrepreneurship process from a systemic perspective, to support a greater contribution of academic institutions to the economic and social development of the nations and societies."
"Mobile screens and the public event: screen practices at the Anzac Day Dawn Service Memorial; Heritage Tourism; Anzac Following current literature on public and mobile screens, this paper discuses the relevance that screens have in our everyday lives by focusing on the combination of mobile and temporary screen-based practices in the digital mediation of a single public commemorative event. We present an ethnographic account of different screen practices at the Anzac Day dawn Service, an annual Australian commemorative ceremony on a public holiday, 25 April. By focusing our analysis in a single place for a limited time, we analyse how people relate to screens in different ways, from media reception to spatial organization to online connection. We suggest that screens form a fundamental element of the entanglement between public space and political narrative that needs further investigation because this relationship holds implications for both urban life and citizenship."

"Bus frequency optimization: when waiting time matters in user satisfaction Vehicle Scheduling; Passengers; Rapid Transit Reorganizing bus frequency to cater for the actual travel demand can save the cost of the public transport system significantly. Many, if not all, existing studies formulate this as a bus frequency optimization problem which tries to minimize passengersâ€™ average waiting time. However, many investigations have confirmed that the user satisfaction drops faster as the waiting time increases. Consequently, this paper studies the bus frequency optimization problem considering the user satisfaction. Specifically, for the first time to our best knowledge, we study how to schedule the buses such that the total number of passengers who could receive their bus services within the waiting time threshold is maximized. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, and present an index-based algorithm with $$(1-1/e)$$ approximation ratio. By exploiting the locality property of routes in a bus network, we propose a partition-based greedy method which achieves a $$(1-\rho )(1-1/e)$$ approximation ratio. Then we propose a progressive partition-based greedy method to further improve the efficiency while achieving a $$(1\,-\,\rho )(1\,-\,1/e-\varepsilon )$$ approximation ratio. Experiments on a real city-wide bus dataset in Singapore verify the efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability of our methods."

"FinTech: Harnessing Innovation for Financial Inclusion New Product Development; Fuzzy Front End; Innovation The landscape of financial inclusion has for long been considered as the soft side of financial services, having received scarce attention from a financial, regulatory, and policy point of view, despite its central role within the global economic empowerment. Part of the disadvantaged and low-income segments of global population is left without (i.e. financially excluded) or very limited access (i.e. financially underserved) to basic financial services, creating a highly critical equality deficit in different parts of the world. In this frame of reference, financial exclusion still remains a highly critical problem that hinders developing regions around the world from eradicating poverty leading to large-scale starvation and civil unrest. Moreover, financial exclusion is interwoven with social dependency making financially excluded/underserved populations strongly dependable on their social networks. The emergence of FinTech, the new breed between financial innovation and financial technology, which has been challenging the prevailing position of incumbent financial institutions, is providing a promising vehicle of tackling this phenomenon by closing the gap between unbanked, under-banked and developed societies, opening the door to the global digital economy, bringing a long-term societal transformational change for the financially excluded/underserved, while leading to inclusive economic growth helping move towards a more just and equitable society."

"Application of nonthermal processing technologies in extracting and modifying polysaccharides: A critical review Galacturonic Acid; Characterization; 2-Diethylaminoethanol Polysaccharides are natural polymer compounds widely distributed in plants, animals, and microorganisms, most of which have a broad spectrum of biological activities to promote human health. They could also be used as texture modifiers in food industry due to their excellent rheological and mechanical properties. Many researchers have shown that nonthermal processing technologies have numerous advantages, such as high extraction efficiency, short extraction time, and environmental friendliness, in the extraction of polysaccharides compared with the traditional extraction methods. Moreover, nonthermal technologies could effectively change the physicochemical properties and structural characteristics of polysaccharides to improve their biological activities or processing properties. Therefore, a comprehensive summary about the extraction and modification of polysaccharides by nonthermal technologies, including ultrasound, high hydrostatic pressure, pulsed electric fields, and cold plasma, was provided in this review. In particular, the underlying mechanisms, processing operations, and current application status of these technologies were discussed. In addition, the applications of combining nonthermal techniques with other technological methods in polysaccharide extraction and modification were briefly introduced."

"Reconciling multiple counterfactuals when evaluating biodiversity conservation impact in social-ecological systems Conservation Banking; Environmental Protection; Compensatory Measure When evaluating the impact of a biodiversity conservation intervention, a counterfactual is typically needed. Counterfactuals are possible alternative system trajectories in the absence of an intervention. Comparing observed outcomes against the chosen counterfactual allows the impact (change attributable to the intervention) to be determined. Because counterfactuals by definition never occur, they must be estimated. Sometimes, there may be many plausible counterfactuals, including various drivers of biodiversity change and defined on a range of spatial or temporal scales. Here, we posit that, by definition, conservation interventions always take place in social-ecological systems (SES) (i.e., ecological systems integrated with human actors). Evaluating the impact of an intervention in an SES, therefore, means taking into account the counterfactuals assumed by different human actors. Use of different counterfactuals by different actors will give rise to perceived differences in the impacts of interventions, which may lead to disagreement about its success or the effectiveness of the underlying approach. Despite that there are biophysical biodiversity trends, it is often true that no single counterfactual is definitively the right one for conservation assessment, so multiple evaluations of intervention efficacy could be considered justifiable. Therefore, we propose calculating the sum of perceived differences, which captures the range of impact estimates associated with different actors in a given SES. The sum of perceived differences gives some indication of how closely actors in an SES agree on the impacts of an intervention. We applied the concept of perceived differences to a set of global, national, and regional case studies (e.g., global realization of Aichi Target 11 for marine protected areas, effect of biodiversity offsetting on vegetation condition in Australia, and influence of conservation measures on an endangered ungulate in Central Asia). We explored approaches for minimizing the sum, including a combination of negotiation and structured decision making, careful alignment of expectations on scope and measurement, and explicit recognition of any intractable differences between stakeholders."
"Is energy security a driver for economic growth? Evidence from a global sample Consumption Growth; Renewable Energy Consumption; Economic Growth This study examines whether energy security contributes to economic growth for a global sample of 74 countries covering the period from 2002 to 2013. The benchmark model is built based on an extended version of the Cobb-Douglas production function. Ten measures of energy security are employed to capture five aspects of energy security including availability, accessibility, acceptability, affordability, and develop-ability. Besides the whole sample, we also conduct the panel data analysis on subsamples of countries based on different income levels, using Panel-Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) and Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) techniques that correct for heterogeneity and autocorrelation and produce robust standard errors. The empirical results appear to be relatively robust to these two estimation techniques. Overall, we find that energy security enhances economic growth for both the whole sample and subsamples of countries. Meanwhile, energy insecurity measured by energy intensity and carbon intensity variables has a negative impact on economic growth. The results vary across subsamples for several cases. The findings imply that at the global level, energy for economic development, energy security, and climate change mitigation should be pursued as integrated themes since there are linkages among these three agendas."

"Temporal and spatial variations of microplastics in roadside dust from rural and urban Victoria, Australia: Implications for diffuse pollution Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Microplastic pollution is an important issue for environmental management as their ubiquity in marine and freshwaters has been confirmed. Pollution sources are key to understanding how microplastics travel from land to open oceans. Given that information regarding microplastic transport from diffuse sources is limiting, we conducted a study on roadside dust from rural and urban Victoria, Australia, over two seasons. Any deposited fugitive dust and particulate matter may also be present in our samples. The average microplastic abundance over two seasons ranged from 20.6 to 529.3 items/kg (dry weight based), with a predominant portion of fibers and items less than 1 mm. Polyester and polypropylene were the dominant polymer types (26%) while cotton and cellulose were the most common non-plastic items (27%). Sampling sites displayed consistent microplastic abundances over time and shared similar patterns in size, shape and polymer composition. Multiple correlation and principal component analysis suggest that urbanization and rainfall are important influences to roadside microplastic accumulation. The observed microplastic hotspots were generally located within close vicinity of areas where urban intensive land use and regional population sizes are high. Microplastics accumulated on roads and road verges during periods of dry weather and were flushed away during heavy storms while the corresponding trigger value was unknown. Monitoring roadside dust can be considered as an initial and cost-effective screening of microplastic pollution in urban areas. Further efforts should be made to optimize the methodologies and we advocate prolonged sampling schemes for roadside dust monitoring. Urbanization and weather conditions are major factors to microplastic accumulation by roadsides."
"Generation of microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii expressing VP28 protein as oral vaccine candidate for shrimps against White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) infection White Spot Syndrome Virus; Shrimp; Gill-Associated Virus White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) is a major cause of mortality in shrimp cultivation on farms all around the world. The serious monetary losses related with its occurrence in susceptible shrimps and the limitations of current methods used to treat WSSV disease in Vietnam, highlight the need for new methods to prevent and to manage the disease. The current study investigates the possibility of expressing the VP28 protein of WSSV from the nucleus of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii for WSSV control. The VP28 protein of WSSV was successfully expressed in C. reinhardtii as confirmed by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR. The immunological parameters analyzed in shrimp administered with 4 mg of dried algae (~ 6 Ã— 107 cells)/1 g shrimp showed a high-level expression of lysosome (LSZ), anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and prophenoloxidase (proPO) compared to the control group. The result of oral administration experiments indicated that vaccinated shrimp survived up to 70% of the time as opposed to control group with 100% mortality. Taken together, the result indicated that recombinant C. reinhardtii expressing VP28 has a potential utility as an oral vaccine candidate against WSSV."

"Layered bismuth-based photocatalysts Bismuth Oxybromide; Degradation; Oxyhalides Semiconductor photocatalysis has received considerable interdisciplinary attentions and research interests owing to its versatile applications. Layered bismuth-based (LBB) materials, featured by layered structure built by [Bi2O2]2+ slices and interleaved anions or/and anionic groups, show huge potentials in solar energy catalytic conversion due to their unique crystal structure, diverse composition, rich atomic coordination and favorable hybrid electronic band structure. In this review, we provide a comprehensive, systematic and timely summary on the LBB-based materials applied in photocatalysis, which start with the classification, characteristics, and synthesis. Subsequently, LBB photocatalysts are classified into SillÃ©n-structured, Aurivillius-structured, SillÃ©n-Aurivillius-structured and SillÃ©n/Aurivillius-related structured photocatalysts based on the interleaved unit types, and all kinds of strategies for improving their photocatalytic performance are presented in details, including microstructure regulation (morphology control and facet engineering), crystal structure regulation (elements doping, crystal vacancy creation, layered structure regulation and polar enhancement) and heterojunction construction (semiconductor/LBB heterojunctions, carbon/LBB composites, polymer/LBB composites and multicomponent heterojunctions). Comprehensive photocatalytic applications of LBB materials, including pollutants purification, bacterial disinfection, water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, H2O2 production/decomposition, selective organic synthesis, photoelectrocatalysis, as well as photocatalysis-assisted piezocatalysis and electrochemical energy storage are introduced in the respective type. Finally, concluding perspectives and outlook towards the future development of LBB photocatalysts are provided. This review is expected to furnish a sweeping guideline for the in-depth understanding and rational design of LBB photocatalysts, and inspire new concepts and advancements in other booming fields for energy and environmental applications."

"Matching symbiotic associations of an endangered orchid to habitat to improve conservation outcomes Germination; Tulasnella; Cephalanthera Background and Aims: An understanding of mycorrhizal variation, orchid seed germination temperature and the effect of co-occurring plant species could be critical for optimizing conservation translocations of endangered plants with specialized mycorrhizal associations. Methods: Focusing on the orchid Thelymitra epipactoides, we isolated mycorrhizal fungi from ten plants within each of three sites; Shallow Sands Woodland (SSW), Damp Heathland (DH) and Coastal Heathland Scrub (CHS). Twenty-seven fungal isolates were tested for symbiotic germination under three 24 h temperature cycles: 12 Â°C for 16 h-16 Â°C for 8 h, 16 Â°C for 16 h-24 Â°C for 8 h or 27 Â°C constant. Fungi were sequenced using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), nuclear large subunit 1 (nLSU1), nLSU2 and mitochondrial large rRNA gene (mtLSU). Orchids were grown to maturity and co-planted with each of ten associated plant species in a glasshouse experiment with tuber width measured at 12 months after co-planting. Key Results: Two Tulasnella fungal lineages were isolated and identified by phylogenetic analyses, operational taxonomic unit 1 (OTU1) and 'T. asymmetrica'. Fungal lineages were specific to sites and did not co-occur. OTU1 (from the SSW site) germinated seed predominantly at 12-16 Â°C (typical of autumn-winter temperature) whereas 'T. asymmetrica' (from the DH and CHS sites) germinated seed across all three temperature ranges. There was no difference in the growth of adult orchids germinated with different OTUs. There was a significant reduction in tuber size of T. epipactoides when co-planted with six of the commonly co-occurring plant species. Conclusions: We found that orchid fungal lineages and their germination temperature can change with habitat, and established that translocation sites can be optimized with knowledge of co-occurring plant interactions. For conservation translocations, particularly under a changing climate, we recommend that plants should be grown with mycorrhizal fungi tailored to the recipient site."

"Indigenous masculinity in sport: the power and pitfalls of rugby league for Australia’s Pacific Island diaspora Fiji; Sports; Methodism Pasifika men are significantly over-represented in Australiaâ€™s National Rugby League and their dramatic influx into the sport over the past 10â€“15 years has often been attributed to their â€˜naturalâ€™ athleticism and other corporeal reasons invoking hyper-masculinity. Coupled with this discourse is the commonly accepted idea that these sporting opportunities are a good thing for Pasifika peoples. This paper considers both the damaging effects of the â€˜hyper-masculine bodyâ€™ and â€˜sport-as-inherently goodâ€™ discourses, and addresses the positive potential rugby league has in transgressing various forms of oppression. Rather than arguing that sport is a positive force in society or outright challenging that assertion, I demonstrate how rugby league in Australia plays a paradoxical role in both reinforcing and challenging social values around race and masculinity. It can be a rare space for positive visibility and upward mobility for Pasifika and other Indigenous men, and a space of exploitation, degradation and racism; it can even save lives and destroy them. I argue that these complexities should be better understood before any moral claim is made about the positives or negatives of sport for marginalised peoples."

"Bernoulli track-before-detect filter for maritime radar Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Clutter; Target Detection In this work, the authors study the problem of detecting and tracking small targets using high-resolution maritime radar, where sea clutter is correlated in range, and its amplitude fluctuations are characterised by occasional spikes. To tackle this problem, they develop a Bernoulli track-before-detect filter, as the optimal recursive Bayesian detector/estimator of target state and its presence in noise. A realistic clutter model, in the form of the K-distribution with unknown distribution parameters, is adopted. Target amplitude fluctuations are also included in the model. The detection and tracking improvement are demonstrated by simulations and compared against a conventional point target tracking algorithm."
"Application of a harmonized life cycle assessment method for supplementary cementitious materials in structural concrete Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Substitution of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), such as fly ash and slag, can reduce energy consumption, thus a consequent depletion in carbon footprint. While there are some methods available for assessing sustainability, most studies considered only one or two aspects. Due to a lack of integration and uncertainty analysis, it is difficult for decision-makers to integrate possible mechanical, environmental, economic, and social measures for concrete selection. Therefore, this study performs regression analysis and Monte Carlo simulations on mechanical properties of concrete with different mix proportions of SCMs. The probabilistic distribution of uncertainty analysis shows concrete strength has a higher association with cement mix (r > 0.8) than slag (r = 0.77) and fly ash (r = 0.63) mixes. Harmonized method of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) has been presented to categorize impacts from short-term to long-term perspectives in terms of human health damage (DALY), ecosystem damage (species.year), and resource availability ($) to take care of both environmental and social aspects. Single objective Pareto analysis determines cement's optimum replacement can happen with 20% fly ash and 30% slag. A total reduction of 2745 megatons CO2 and monetary savings of 209 billion dollars is feasible by replacing 50% of the produced cement globally (4.1 gigatons) with SCMs, which can be rewarded for human health and ecological recoveries."

"Understanding the properties of fat, oil, and grease and their removal using grease interceptors Lubricating Greases; Oils and Fats; Waste Water Treatment of wastewater with high levels of fat, oil, and grease (FOG), produced by the growing number (annually 2%) of food service establishments (FSEs), is a major concern for water utilities. About 30â€“40% of sewer blockages are caused primarily by the formation of FOG deposits in sewer pipes, and an annual additional maintenance cost is required for sewer management. To manage FOG deposition, FSEs are required to recover the FOG at the point of generation by installing grease interceptors (GIs) before release to the sewer system. The successful control of FOG deposition is largely dependent on clear understanding of its complex properties, pre-treatment processes, deposition mechanism and public awareness. The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the physicochemical properties of FOG, including particle size distribution and their removal efficiencies by existing GIs. Nowadays, generation of FOG particles of â‰¤45 Âµm is increasing because of the increasing use of automatic dishwashers. Current hybrid processes which comprise pre-treatment prior to GI use are ineffective since they are unable to completely remove particle sizes of â‰¤45 Âµm. Hence, there is potential for these particles to be released into the sewer system and eventually cause blockages. This critical review discusses the characteristics of effluents, including the particle size distributions generated from automatic dishwashers and handwash sinks. It concludes by providing some case studies and a perspective of the future opportunities to develop a novel GI process integrated with pre-treatment to remove particles of all sizes, including colloidal particles."

"From Refugees to Trans-local Entrepreneurs: Crossing the Borders between Formal Institutions and Informal Practices in Bosnia and Herzegovina Bosnia-Herzegovina; Bosnian; Armed Conflict This article focuses on the former war refugees, who (partly) returned to their homeland Bosnia and Herzegovina and became significant investors in their local communities. We are particularly interested in their experiences with manoeuvring between different countries and institutional environments, as these refugee entrepreneurs are running their businesses simultaneously in developed European economies (Switzerland and Sweden) and in their home country. Although the two companies run by the former refugees described in the article are located in the areas that remain divided along the ethnic lines caused by the war (Srebrenica and Banja Luka), we find that the post-war returnees' businesses are ethnically tolerant and inclusive, sending a powerful message to the formal institutions, which often act in the opposite way."

"Upcycling Domestic Food Waste: How To Make Better Compost, Faster Microbial decomposition of organic matter is the underlying mechanism that enables us to reduce the volume of our domestic food waste and transform it into valuable compost. This upcycled product can enhance the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, enabling us to grow healthier plants and tastier food in our urban environment. There is widespread understanding of the conditions conducive to microbial decomposition of organic matter. Internal factors (physical and chemical composition of the food waste; size, activity and composition of the microbial community) and external factors (temperature, water content, aeration, additives) all play a role. This research will explore which factors are the most important to this specific application: home composting in urban Australia. Further, the project will seek to develop recommendations as to how these factors can be optimized to produce compost faster. A replicated factorial experimental design will alter individual factors and combinations of factors.  The approach will be grounded in the needs and realities of the industry serving the home compost market, with a combination of laboratory and full-scale field trials. "
"Nanosilica modified high-volume fly ash and slag cement composite: Environmentally friendly alternative to OPC Cement; Rice Hulls; Mortar In the quest to develop a green cement composite with the lowest possible carbon footprint and the highest possible use of industrial by-products, an experimental investigation was undertaken, replacing 100% of ordinary portland cement. This paper presents the results of an experimental program to develop a zero-cement composite, incorporating 2.5, 5, and 7.5% nanosilica, 72.5, 70, and 67.5% fly ash, 25% ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), and hydrated lime used as a cement additive at 10 and 15% of the total supplementary cementitious material. Compressive strength tests were undertaken to study the mechanical properties of mortar samples of various mix designs. In addition, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry, and X-ray diffraction were undertaken in conjunction with quantitative phase analysis to investigate the various physicochemical changes taking place within the cement matrix and to formulate strategies for its further development. The results demonstrate that the addition of nanosilica and hydrated lime to low calcium/high-volume fly ash and GGBFS blend can help in achieving an environmentally friendly zero-cement composite without the need of any heat treatment. The optimum content of nanosilica was found to be 5%. With the further increase in nanosilica content, although the pozzolanic reaction and the resulting C-S-H=C-A-S-H gel formation increases, it also increases the microcracking within the cement matrix, resulting in the reduction in compressive strength at both 7 and 28 days of curing. The siliceous hydrogarnet formed as a result of the pozzolanic reaction of amorphous silica (FA, GGBFS, NS), with the calcium aluminate present in GGBFS, shows very poor crystallinity with no visible peak reflection in X-ray diffraction data. The formation of siliceous hydrogarnet increases with the increase in amorphous nanosilica, but decreases with the increase in hydrated lime content."
"Challenges and opportunities of the fourth revolution: a brief insight into the future of food Fog Computing; Network Protocol; Internet of Things By 2050, the global population is projected to be in excess of nine billion people. This will result in an increased burden and stress on the food production systems, particularly in adjustments to several stages of the value chain that will require improvements and/or modifications in their effectiveness such as reducing waste, adapting to climate change, food security, and health. Disruptions such as digital agriculture, digital food, food agility, big data, have been utilized to characterize the changes in the way agro-food systems evolve and function, as well as in the approach they have been analyzed, measured, and monitored. It has been long recognized that the food industry is considered as a data driven enterprise. These characteristics are very important as the food industry becomes global and sustainable. The food industry is currently undergoing significant changes, and with this, challenges are occurring. These challenges are brought about from the food chains, climate changes, and the ability to be resilient in the production of food. Furthermore, health and cultural changes to food are occurring, where the diseases of obesity, diabetes, and aging in the population will continue to change the consumerâ€™s patterns and choices; whereby the consumer will be persuaded to choose and eat healthy and more nutritious foods. Indeed, the cultural awareness and social innovation to prevent food waste and therefore improve food security and sustainability will also prove to further complexities. This short review will briefly discuss some of the forefront issues in food value chains with a focus on using technology."

"Combining environmental isotopes with Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) to characterise wastewater derived impacts on groundwater quality PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs The potential for Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) to cause adverse impacts to groundwater quality is a major global environmental challenge. Robust and sensitive techniques are required to characterise these impacts, particularly in settings with multiple potential contaminant sources (e.g. agricultural vs. site-derived). Stable (Î´2HH2O, Î´18OH2O, Î´15NNO3, Î´18ONO3 and Î´13CDIC) and radioactive (3H and 14C) isotopes were used in conjunction with three Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) - carbamazepine, simazine and sulfamethoxazole - to discriminate between multiple potential contamination sources at an Australian WWTP. The radioactive isotope tritium provided a sensitive indicator of recent (post-1990s) leakage, with groundwater activities between 0.68 and 1.83 TU, suggesting WWTP infrastructure (activities between 1.65 and 2.41) acted as a recharge â€˜windowâ€™, inputting treated or partially treated effluent to the underlying groundwater system. This was corroborated by water stable isotopes, which showed clear demarcation between Î´18OH2O and Î´2HH2O in background groundwater (Î´18OH2O and Î´2HH2O values of approximately âˆ’5 and âˆ’28â€°, respectively) and those associated with on-site wastewater (median Î´18OH2O and Î´2HH2O values of âˆ’1.2 and âˆ’7.6â€°, respectively), with groundwater down-gradient of the plant plotting on a mixing line between these values. The CECs, particularly the carbamazepine:simazine ratio, provided a means to further distinguish wastewater impacts from other sources, with groundwater down-gradient of the plant reporting elevated ratios (median of 0.98) compared to those up-gradient (median of 0.11). Distinctive CEC ratios in impacted groundwater close to the WWTP (âˆ¼3.0) and further down-gradient (2.7â€“9.3) are interpreted to represent a change in composition over time (i.e., recent vs. legacy contamination), consistent with the site development timeline and possible changes in effluent composition resulting from infrastructure upgrades over time. The data indicate a complex set of co-mingled plumes, reflecting different inputs (in terms of both quantity and concentration) over time. Our approach provides a means to better characterise the nature and timing of wastewater derived impacts on groundwater systems, with significant global implications for site management, potentially allowing more targeted monitoring, management and remedial actions to be undertaken."

"Designing with nature-based solutions to mitigate flooding in mataniko river catchment, honiara Flood Damage; Flooding; Natural Hazards With increasing population and pressure on land resources in the wake of climate change in Oceanic Cities, working locally with ecosystems through nature-based solutions can be a practical approach towards resilient landscapes. Extreme weather conditions and rainfall events as inevitable consequences of the future change require landscape designers to stay abreast of technology in hydrology and hydraulic modelling. This paper illustrates experimental landscape interventions to redesign topographic configurations in Adobe Photoshop that offers unlimited opportunities for developing scenarios for flood mitigation. Through the coupling of GIS with a program that models the hydraulics of water flow, a method to familiarise designers with flood impacts using an iterative and scientifically informed design process is proposed. We conclude through the proposed workflow that the application of nature-based solutions was effective in reducing the water depth in flood events by 6.67 meters in vulnerable areas of the catchment occupied by informal settlements."

"Identifying in-app user actions from mobile web logs Websites; Web Log; Blogs We address the problem of identifying in-app user actions from Web access logs when the content of those logs is both encrypted (through HTTPS) and also contains automated Web accesses. We find that the distribution of time gaps between HTTPS accesses can distinguish user actions from automated Web accesses generated by the apps, and we determine that it is reasonable to identify meaningful user actions within mobile Web logs by modelling this temporal feature. A real-world experiment is conducted with multiple mobile devices running some popular apps, and the results show that the proposed clustering-based method achieves good accuracy in identifying user actions, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 17.84%."

"Influenza-specific IgG1+ memory B-cell numbers increase upon booster vaccination in healthy adults but not in patients with predominantly antibody deficiency Common Variable Immunodeficiency; Immunoglobulin Deficiency; Immunosuppression Background: Annual influenza vaccination is recommended to all individuals over 6 months of age, including predominantly antibody deficiency (PAD) patients. Vaccination responses are typically evaluated by serology, and because PAD patients are by definition impaired in generating IgG and receive immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT), it remains unclear whether they can mount an antigen-specific response. Objective: To quantify and characterise the antigen-specific memory B (Bmem) cell compartment in healthy controls and PAD patients following an influenza booster vaccination. Methods: Recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) from the A/Michigan/2015 H1N1 (AM15) strain with an AviTag was generated in a mammalian cell line, and following targeted biotinylation, was tetramerised with BUV395 or BUV737 streptavidin conjugates. Multicolour flow cytometry was applied on blood samples before and 28 days after booster influenza vaccination in 16 healthy controls and five PAD patients with circulating Bmem cells. Results: Recombinant HA tetramers were specifically recognised by 0.5â€“1% of B cells in previously vaccinated healthy adults. HA-specific Bmem cell numbers were significantly increased following booster vaccination and predominantly expressed IgG1. Similarly, PAD patients carried HA-specific Bmem cells, predominantly expressing IgG1. However, these numbers were lower than in controls and did not increase following booster vaccination. Conclusion: We have successfully identified AM15-specific Bmem cells in healthy controls and PAD patients. The presence of antigen-specific Bmem cells could offer an additional diagnostic tool to aid in the clinical diagnosis of PAD. Furthermore, alterations in the number or immunophenotype of HA-specific Bmem cells post-booster vaccination could assist in the evaluation of immune responses in individuals receiving IgRT."
"Regional drought risk assessment in the Central Highlands and the South of Vietnam Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China This study contributes to a proof-of-concept comprehensive drought risk assessment for Vietnam by (i) incorporating drought exposure and vulnerability based on specific socio-economic conditions of the regions; and (ii) using satellite data including World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Space-based Weather and Climate Extremes Monitoring (SWCEM) products, and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Enhanced U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Global Data for drought hazard assessment. Drought risk assessment which incorporated hazard, exposure and vulnerability components was conducted for 27 provinces from four administrative areas in Vietnam. Drought Hazard Index (DHI) was derived using the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), the Vegetation Health Index (VHI), and surface soil moisture (SSM) to take into account the impact of both meteorological and agricultural drought. Drought Exposure Index (DEI) and Drought Vulnerability Index (DVI) were calculated using statistical data of land use and socio-economic characteristics obtained from Vietnamâ€™s statistical yearbooks. By combining DHI, DEI and DVI, a composite Drought Risk Index (DRI) was derived for drought risk assessment in the selected provinces for 2020. It was shown that the highest at-risk provinces were in the Mekong River Delta, the agricultural production centre of Vietnam. The South East regions were less impacted by drought compared to other regions. The proposed comprehensive approach to drought risk assessment in Vietnam has potential to contribute to improving drought preparedness and resilience of communities at-risk."

"A multi-criteria decision support framework for municipal solid waste landfill siting: a case study of New South Wales (Australia) Waste Disposal Facilities; Site Selection; Solid Waste Management Sanitary waste disposal and site selection for establishing landfills are challenging problems for environmental planners. This paper aims to take environmental, socio-economic, geological, geomorphological, hydrological and ecological factors into consideration to provide a decision support framework for landfill siting. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) are coupled to develop an efficient multi-criteria decision-making method to be utilized in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment for evaluating the suitability for landfill siting. As the first attempt to employ DEMATEL effectively in a landfill site selection problem, the proposed method is tested with landfill siting scenarios in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Regional analysis is also performed to identify the potentially most suitable statistical divisions for landfill siting in NSW. The top two ranked zones covering 0.7% and 22% of the study area, respectively, are considered as the optimal areas for establishing landfills, while the bottom two ranked zones are not recommended for further consideration. Further detailed analysis is also conducted on the existing landfills, which shows that 1.0% and 37.0% of them are ranks 1 and 2, respectively. The scenario-based analysis implies that, among the contributing factors; geological and economic factors are highly important."

"Teaching Battery Basics in Laboratories: Hands-On Versus Simulated Experiments Virtual Laboratory; Education; Labview Contribution: Prior studies comparing the effectiveness of different laboratory learning modes do not allow one to draw a universally valid conclusion, as other influences are mixed with the learning modes. In order to contribute to the existing body of work and to add another piece to the puzzle, this article demonstrates an improved methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of computer-simulated laboratories in comparison to hands-on exercises using a battery basics practical course as a case study. Background: Computer-simulated experiments are becoming increasingly popular for conducting laboratory exercises in higher education and vocational training institutions. To ensure the consistent quality of laboratory learning, an accurate comparison between the results of simulated experiments and practical hands-on experiments is required. Intended Outcomes: In this article, the achievement of the following learning objectives were compared between the two laboratory modes: 1) comprehension of the most important parameters of battery cells and 2) knowledge on how these parameters can be determined using adequate experimental procedures. Application Design: To avoid interference of factors other than laboratory mode on the learning, laboratory instructions and experimental interfaces ensured identical execution of the experiments in the compared modes. Using a counterbalanced methodology, the two laboratory modes alternated by the session, while the experimental procedures remained constant regardless of the respective modes. Findings: Tests taken by the participants after conducting the laboratory experiments revealed that hands-on laboratories resulted in statistically significantly better student performance than simulated laboratories. This difference was even more pronounced for the participants that finished a vocational education and training program before the university studies."

"Human-made corals for marine habitats: Design optimization and additive manufacturing Boron Isotopes; Coral; Coralline Alga This paper presents an optimization method to systematically design human-made corals using the technique of solid isotropic material with the penalization. In optimization, we minimized the squared norm of the carbon gradient and considered the volume constraint and the length constraint. We homogeneously dented optimization results using a surface mapping method to provide shelters for polyps, which widely exist in natural corals like the anthocyanins. A computational fluid dynamics investigation based on the lattice Boltzmann method illustrated that the branches of the optimized configuration could shield polyps from ocean currents and afford sufficient nutrition. Eventually, we prototyped samples by digital light processing printer with an optimum mixture ratio of biologically compatible calcium carbonate and photosensitive material. Examples show the tropism of marine organisms in human-made corals is akin to the natural ones. The proposed method allows designing human-made corals and is crucial for environmental remediation."

"An Off-Site Supervision Model of Field Education Practice: Innovating While Remaining Rigorous in a Shifting Field Education Context Social Work Students; Work Identity; Placement Traditional approaches to social work field education are being tested due to increasing enrolments, increased competition for placements and reduced availability of social work supervisors. This article presents research findings of one Victorian University's off-site supervision (OSS) model, which examined the experiences of students, off-site supervisors, task supervisors (TS), and the University Field Education (FE) team. Three themes were identified: the benefits, challenges, and opportunities for the development of the OSS model. Nearly all student participants reported good to excellent OSS experiences, could see the merits in external group supervision, and reported having a good placement. However, there is still a perception among students that on-site supervision is preferred over OSS despite many not having experience of the former. IMPLICATIONS The research results suggest greater valuing of the OSS model within The Australian Social Education and Accreditation Standards (ASWEAS). Adequate resources, role clarity, alignment of off-site supervisors with placement context, and effective communication processes are required for off-site supervisors to provide quality placement opportunities. Further research involving stakeholders experienced in both on-site supervision and OSS models is needed into the benefits and limitations of both approaches."

"Simulating urban expansion in a rapidly changing landscape in eastern Tarai, Nepal Sleuths; Cellular Automaton Model; Urbanization Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of urbanization and predicting future growth is now essential for sustainable urban planning and policy making. This study explores future urban expansion in the rapidly growing region of eastern lowland Nepal. We used the hybrid cellular automata-Markov (CA-Markov) model, which utilizes historical land use and land cover (LULC) maps and several biophysical change driver variables to predict urban expansion for the years 2026 and 2036. Transitional area matrices were generated based on historical LULC data from 1996 to 2006, from 2006 to 2016, and from 1996 to 2016. The approach was validated by cross comparing the actual and simulated maps for 2016. Evaluation gave satisfactory values of Kno (0.89), Kstandard (0.84), and Klocation (0.89) which verifies the accuracy of the model. Hence, the CA-Markov model was utilized to simulate the LULC map for the years 2026 and 2036. The study area experienced rapid peri/urban expansion and sharp decline in area of cultivated land during 1989â€“2016. Built-up area increased by 110.90 km 2 over a period of 27 years at the loss of 87.59 km 2 cultivated land. Simulation analysis indicates that urban expansion will continue with urban cover increasing to 230 km 2 (8.95%) and 318.51 km 2 (12.45%) by 2026 and 2036, respectively, with corresponding declines in cultivated land to 1453.83 km 2 (56.86%) and 1374.93 km 2 (53.77%) for the same years. The alarming increase in urban areas coupled with loss of cultivated land will have negative implications for food security and environmental equilibrium in the region."

"The capacity to consent to sex in mental health inpatient units Severe Mental Illness; Mental Patient; HIV Infection Objective: Discussions of capacity to consent in mental health care usually revolve around capacity to consent to treatment. This paper instead explores the issue of capacity to consent to sexual activity in a mental health inpatient setting as a way of exploring capacity from a different perspective. This is not a purely theoretical exercise, with both consensual sexual activity and sexual assault commonplace in mental health inpatient units, current policy and practice approaches are clearly not working and require re-examination. Methods: Four key frameworks are explored: human rights law, mental health law, the criminal law and the law of tort governing the duty of care. These frameworks are explored by highlighting relevant case law and statutes and considering their potential application in practice. This is undertaken using the state of Victoria, Australia, as a case study. Results: The four frameworks are shown to be consistent with each other but inconsistent with contemporary policy. All four legal frameworks explored require clinicians to take a case-by-case assessment to ensure that a personâ€™s right to make their own decisions is preserved â€˜unless the contrary is demonstrably justifiedâ€™ or where it is â€˜legally demandedâ€™. While Victorian inpatient units attempt to enforce a blanket ban on consensual sexual activity in inpatient settings, this ban may be without legal basis and may be in breach of both human rights and mental health law. Conclusion: In policing the lawful bodily interactions of their patients and pushing sexual activity out of sight, clinicians may be breaching their duty of care to provide sexual health support and risk creating an environment in which the therapeutic relationship will be sacrificed to the enforcement of institutional policy. Clinicians and policymakers must understand the relevant legal frameworks to ensure that they are acting ethically and lawfully."
"Social compliance audits and multinational corporation supply chain: evidence from a study of the rituals of social audits Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative This study investigates the use of social compliance audits in the supply chain of multinational corporations (MNCs). Particularly, we explore the use of such audits in assessing and managing the working conditions of factory workers in the garment industry in a developing nation. Through a range of interviews with MNCsâ€™ internal auditors, with commissioned external auditors and with representatives of the suppliers in Bangladesh, this study finds that social compliance audits become ritual strategies and are not a primary means of advancing workersâ€™ rights. Drawing on the concept of surrogate accountability, the study suggests that to create real change in workersâ€™ conditions and in order to hold MNCs and their suppliers accountable, some form of surrogate (government, non-governmental organisations or media) intervention is necessary. This is, we argue, preferable to leaving it in the hands of â€˜marketsâ€™ and simply waiting for another major incident such as Rana Plaza to stir public concern. This study contributes to the literature by investigating how social compliance audits are undertaken by MNCs sourcing products from a developing nation, what motivations drive the adoption of such audits, and what, if anything, are the likely outcomes from the process."
"Bioacoustic monitoring of frogs The project is designed to trial bioacoustic monitoring as a survey method for recording and analysing frog calls to determine the in situ status of frog populations. The field locations are initially to be along the fringe of Melbourne's northern suburbs. The significance of this project is the opportunity to develop a more representative, less invasive frog survey method. Potential sites are identified and the monitoring is expected to continue over several seasons. The project will focus on the Growling Grass Frog Litoria raniformis but will include all frog species that may potentially be found at the trial sites. The bioacoustic monitoring is proposed to run concurrently with standard monitoring (desktop surveys and site visits) allowing the two methods to be compared. A digital reference library based on the acoustic characteristics of each species calls will be created. The recording frequency schedule, duration of recording and optimal recorder siting will be developed. Other site data will be recorded including water chemistry as will climate information from nearby Bureau of Meteorology weather stations. It is expected that this research will contribute towards frog conservation by developing a frog survey method that will potentially increase the accuracy of identifying frog species diversity."

"Viral Determinants of HIV-1 Transcriptional Latency in the Central Nervous System: Impact on Cure Strategies HIV-1 cannot be eradicated by antiretroviral therapies alone. The major obstacle to eradicating HIV-1 is the ability of proviral DNA to persist latently in cellular reservoirs. Delineation of the mechanisms of persistence in cellular reservoirs and how latency can be reversed to render the cells susceptible to cART is a high priority area for HIV-1 research. Currently a number of latency reversing agents (LRAs) are being trialled for their ability to activate HIV-1 viral transcription from latent integrated proviral genomes to expose infected cells for elimination. The affect of these agents on latent viral genomes in CNS reservoirs has not been investigated. We have previously demonstrated that unique transcriptional regulatory mechanisms exist within the CNS of HIV-1 infected patients and that these mechanisms involve transcriptional regulators involved in chromatin formation and latency. This project aims to identify and define the viral determinants of transcriptional latency of HIV-1 persisting in cellular reservoirs in cART controlling patients in vivo and investigate the affect of LRAs on transcriptional activity of LTRs isolated from cellular reservoirs of the CNS and peripheral compartments of the same patient. This project will utilise a unique and valuable resource of human tissues to determine how HIV-1 remains latent in cellular reservoirs of the CNS in vivo and will shed new light on mechanisms underlying HIV-1 latency in the peripheral T-cell compartment. Eradicating latent HIV-1 infection in the brain reservoir, or devising ways to lock HIV-1 residing in latently-infected CNS cells into a permanently silent state, is pivotal for strategies that presently aim to achieve either a ?sterilising cure? of HIV-1 infection or a ?functional cure?, respectively. Both potential outcomes are dependent on understanding the mechanisms of HIV-1 transcription in all latently infected reservoirs."

"Keeping human rights in mind: embedding the Victorian Charter of Human Rights into the public mental health system Health Impact Assessment; Health Equity; Policy Making Despite aims to create a progressive inter-institutional dialogue about human rights, the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities 2006 (Vic) (Charter) has largely fallen flat. This becomes clearest when examining the failure of governments, regulators and services to comply with and properly consider rights when providing public mental health services. By failing to embed human rights in relevant policy levers, institutional and service design processes and workforce initiatives, the Charter bears little relevance to the day-to-day operation of the clinical mental health system. This paper argues that existing obligations on public authorities require a more systematic integration of human rights into the mental health system. In particular, it highlights the importance of Charter implementation into systems monitoring, service commissioning, regulatory oversight, service models of care, clinical governance frameworks and workforce development."

"Ask not what nature can do for you: A critique of ecosystem services as a communication strategy Cultural Ecosystem Services; China; Natural Capital Given the urgent need to raise public awareness on biodiversity issues, we review the effectiveness of â€œecosystem servicesâ€ as a frame for promoting biodiversity conservation. Since its inception as a communications tool in the 1970s, the concept of ecosystem services has become pervasive in biodiversity policy. While the goal of securing ecosystem services is absolutely legitimate, we argue that it has had limited success as a vehicle for securing public interest and support for nature, which is crucial to securing long-term social mandates for protection. Emerging evidence suggests that focusing on ecosystem services rather than the intrinsic value of nature is unlikely to be effective in bolstering public support for nature conservation. Theory to guide effective communication about nature is urgently needed. In the mean-time, communicators should reflect on their objectives and intended audience and revisit the way nature is framed to ensure maximum resonance."

"Effective communication in the context of safe design decision making Construction Safety; Occupational Accidents; Accident The proactive practice of anticipating and â€˜designing outâ€™ health and safety (H&S) risks at the early stage of a construction project, known as safety in design, is a legislative requirement in Australia, as in many other countries. Effective communication between design participants and collaborative decision-making during the design stage have been highlighted in previous research as key factors contributing to effective safety in design. However, previous research has not explicitly identified what constitutes effective communication. To explore how the interactions between design and construction decision-makers impact on the quality of design decisions and their H&S outcomes in construction projects, six cases were studied in detail. In each case study, a multilevel framework was implemented representing the design process as a socio-technical network. Thus, communication activities were considered within the context of design decision-making, and the features of effective communication were investigated. The results indicate that effective interaction networks need to provide decision makers with access to suitable knowledge sources and enable the mobility and combination of existing knowledge and new or emerging project information to create design solutions with positive H&S outcomes. The study also revealed certain network features which contribute to alignment between the information interdependencies of design decisions and the communication patterns that underpin them, leading to better safety in design outcomes. The findings provide a realistic understanding of effective communication in the context of safety in design."

"Caretakers' perceptions and willingness-to-pay for complementary food in urban and rural Cambodia Malnutrition; Child Nutrition Disorders; Stunting Inadequate child nutrition during the first â€˜1000 daysâ€™ is widespread in Cambodia, resulting in a high prevalence of child malnutrition. Access to processed complementary food in packages (PCFP) may support caretakers in improving diet of young children. This study aimed to evaluate the caretakers' preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for PCFP in Cambodia. The study was conducted in urban and rural settings, involving 520 caretakers with children aged 7â€“24 months in Phnom Penh (urban) and Prey Veng (rural). Four PCFPs were included: a commercial brand, a social-commercial brand, a worldwide distributed fortified complementary food aid product (CSB++) and an experimental fortified rice-and-fish-based PCFP developed in Cambodia (WF-L). Sensory analysis was conducted for all products, stated WTP was assessed for three products (excluding CSB++) and actual WTP experiment was conducted on WF-L only. Our results show that overall, WF-L was preferred by the rural participants over food aid CSB++. Further improvements in the organoleptic qualities of WF-L should focus on consistency and taste. The participants were, on average, willing to pay 1,667 Cambodian riel (KHR, $0.4) and 1,192 KHR ($0.3) in urban and rural settings, respectively, for 35 g of WF-L. We also found that despite being nutritionally inadequate, most participants considered homemade porridge to be healthier, more practical and preferred by the children. Therefore improving the quality of homemade foods merits urgent consideration. When applying PCFP in nutrition programmes as a supplementary option to homemade complementary foods, locally produced products could be a more viable supplementary option than global food aid."
"WeChatting the Australian Election: Mandarin-Speaking Migrants and the Teaching of New Citizenship Practices Political Participation; Social Media; Media Use With the number of Mandarin-speaking migrants on the rise in Australia and the centrality of Chinese social media platforms among a large majority of this cohort, it is time that we examined the role of WeChat in political communication and citizenship education among Chinese migrants. In the lead-up to the May 2019 federal election, WeChat became a political campaigning battlefield in which candidates held live WeChat sessions with Chinese Australian voters. Despite much discussion about WeChatâ€™s impact on Australian politics, there is little understanding of its potential educational role in citizen-making: to what extent does WeChat educate new citizens about Australiaâ€™s political system, democratic values, and electoral processes? This article uses the 2019 federal election as a prism through which to explore civic education and citizen-making in the digital space of WeChat. Drawing on online surveys, sustained digital ethnographic observation, and in-depth one-on-one interviews, we ask whether and how the work of certain individuals in this digital space engenders a new form of community leadership and a more engaged form of civic behavior. We also assess WeChatâ€™s potential in facilitating the process of political integration for new migrants from authoritarian societies."
"In the Game: Overcoming barriers and parental attitudes towards physical activity outcomes of Muslim girls on the fringes of Melbourne This study examines the reasons and circumstances that affect parents’ decisions to facilitate their daughter's participation in physical activity and sports. With a focus on health equity, we will examine factors such as socio-economic status of families, occupation of parents, single parenthood, number of children, safety concerns, and cultural and religious factors such as attitudes toward female children, as well as the impact of coming from refugee or newly arrived migrant backgrounds that may influence parental attitudes towards their children's physical activity. While there is a plethora of literature available on the importance of physical activity for children, there is insufficient in-depth data that focuses on Muslim girls in Victoria. The poor participation of this section of the Victorian community in physical activity needs to be examined and better understood in order to achieve health equity. Moreover, considering the cultural and linguistic diversity within Muslim communities, ethno-specific issues need to be addressed alongside over-arching similarities that stem from their religious belief and practice. The in-depth mixed method study aims to address this set of interrelated issues and unused potentials."

"Fire retardancy and thermal behaviors of Cellulose nanofiber/zinc borate aerogel Aerogels; Mechanical Properties; Flame Retardants Cellulose nanofiber (CNF)/zinc borate (ZB) aerogels were successfully prepared via a facile and simple freeze-drying method. The thermal and combustion behavior of synthesized CNF aerogels and CNF/ZB aerogels were systematically investigated via various experimental techniques, including TGA-DTG analysis, micro-scale combustion calorimetry, cone calorimeter, etc. It was known that the CNF aerogels mainly undergo smoldering combustion. The flame retardancy of CNF aerogels was observed remarkably improved with the introduction of ZB, where the formed carbon layer at the sample surface can prevent heat penetration. It was known from micro-scale calorimeter (MCC) test that the burning of CNF/ZB could not last over 20 s, where peak heat release rate and total heat release decrease by 35.1% and 16.3%, respectively, after 2 wt% ZB was added. Meanwhile, the presence of ZB did not affect the porous structure of CNF, which can be proved by the slightly increased thermal conductivity from 0.0276 to 0.0298 W/m K. Flame retardancy of ZB shows its advantages for cellulose aerogels as the improved flame retardancy by ZB will not compromise its original thermal insulation function. The research outcomes of this study provide a new insight for the flame retardancy of cellulose aerogels. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]"

"Addressing sexual harassment law’s inadequacies in altering behaviour and preventing harm: A structural approach Title VII; Transgender Persons; Affirmative Action Section 3(c) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) provides that one object of the Act is â€˜to eliminate, so far as is possible, discrimination involving sexual harassment in the workplace, in educational organisations and in other areas of public activityâ€™. This article argues that the Act, in its current form, is not adequate for achieving that object for two reasons: first, its operative provisions reflect a normative principle that has, as its aim, the compensation of harm but not the prevention of future harm; and second, it fails to recognise some systemic harms caused by sexual harassment. The article proposes a structural approach to workplace sexual harassment regulation, which involves a positive duty for organisations to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment and a regulatory framework aimed at putting in place the necessary motivations and incentives to ensure compliance with that duty. The article draws on insights from regulatory theory to explain how this regulatory approach can better serve the object of eliminating sexual harassment so far as is possible."

"Supportive employment practices: perspectives of autistic employees Autism Spectrum Disorder; Asperger Syndrome; Coping Behavior Purpose: Employment can make an important contribution to individual well-being, for example, by providing people with a sense of purpose; however, autistic individuals face significant barriers to entering the workforce. This is reflected in high levels of underemployment and unemployment, with an estimated 80% of autistic people unemployed worldwide. This is higher than both other disability groups and people without disabilities. Research is needed to identify strategies that facilitate the sustained employment of autistic adults. This study aims to examine the perspectives of autistic individuals participating in a specialized employment program within the information and communication technology sector. Design/methodology/approach: Three focus groups were conducted with nine adults on the autism spectrum. Data were analyzed using an inductive approach according to established guidelines, which included coding and categorizing data into themes. Findings: Focus group analysis revealed four themes: traineesâ€™ previous work experiences; expectations of the employment program; recruitment and selection processes; and training and transition. Several factors associated with the changes to the recruitment and selection process were found to benefit the autistic employees. Originality/value: Few studies have characterized the work experiences of adults on the autism spectrum. Tailored employment processes that challenge traditional human resource management practices can increase the participation of autistic individuals in the workforce. Strategies for promoting the success of these programs are discussed."
"What are the primary limitations in B-cell affinity maturation, and how much affinity maturation can we drive with vaccination?: A role for antibody feedback Germinal Center; Plasma Cells; B Lymphocytes We discuss the impact of antibody feedback on affinity maturation of B cells. Competition from epitope-specific antibodies produced earlier during the immune response leads to immune complex formation, which is essential for transport and deposition of antigen onto follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). It also reduces the concentration of free epitopes into the Î¼M to nM range, which is essential for B-cell receptors (BCRs) to sense affinity-dependent changes in binding capacity. Antibody feedback may also induce epitope spreading, leading to a broader selection of epitopes recognized by newly emerging B-cell clones. This may be exploitable, providing ways to manipulate epitope usage induced by vaccination."

"Understanding Collaborative Investigative Journalism in a “Post-Truth” Age Journalism; News; Social Media The political economy for watchdog reporting is deeply challenging, yet exposing abuses of public trust had renewed focus in 2016. â€œSpotlightâ€â€”a Boston Globe investigation into Catholic Church sex abuseâ€”inspired an Oscar-winning film. Two months later, 300 International Consortium for Investigative Journalism members broke the global story of tax evasion with the Panama Papers. These represent exemplar moments for watchdog journalism in a â€œpost-truthâ€ age characterised by fake news. They illustrate a shift in investigative reporting practice: from an â€œold modelâ€ of a highly competitive single newsroom environmentâ€”like the â€œSpotlightâ€ teamâ€”to a â€œnew modelâ€ of multiple newsrooms (and countries) sharing information to expose wrongdoing on a global scale, like the Panama Papers. This paper applies mixed methods to analyse the development and consequences of this new model of collaborative investigative journalism. It examines 30 years of national media awards in Britain, the United States and Australia to identify when award-winning newsroom collaborations began, their key story targets and outcomes. These findings are triangulated with interviews with investigative journalists. The findings theoretically and empirically add to emerging scholarship examining how digital media technologiesâ€”held responsible for the â€œjournalism crisisâ€â€”paradoxically offer opportunities for evidence-based journalism."

"Nebulised Nano-therapeutics for the treatment of drug resistant Tuberculosis. (Grant number 414953790) Tuberculosis (TB) is a global disease, found in every country in the world. The World Health Organization estimates that two billion people ?one third of the world's population?are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the bacteria that causes TB. Each year, 10.4 million fall ill from TB and 1.7 million die. There is growing resistance to available drugs, which means the disease is becoming more deadly and difficult to treat. There are 490,000 cases of MDR-TB each year. The global tuberculosis drugs market was estimated at USD 1,046 million in 2017 and is expected to reach USD 1,432 million in 2024 at a CAGR of 4.6% during the forecast period. The global first-line TB drug market ranges from approximately US$310M-316M. 
Our SME partner Apta Bharat Ltd in India is at the forefront of developing selective, novel drug molecules or inhibitors i.e. ssDNA aptamer for drug-resistant TB therapeutics and has access to the sputum samples for childhood TB. Efficient delivery of these aptamers to bacterial cells inside the lungs is crucial to delivering maximum antibacterial efficacy. RMIT researchers have developed capability in novel drug delivery systems targeted to the lungs using an advanced nebulisation platform. The overarching aim of this project is to combine the delivery capabilities of these novel nanoparticulate drug delivery systems with an advanced nebulisation platform that allows further targeting by locally delivering the drug directly to the site of infection."
"Recovery of nitrogen from human waste: A low-cost solutions for wastewater
 treatment plants (PhD candidate: Pobritra Kumar Halder) • Experimental and modelling data and their analysis (possibly in a written journal manuscript form) 
• Adsorption kinetics and isotherms for estimating the footprints of the adsorbent bed

The wastewater that enters to the WWTP is mainly consisted of domestic and industrial wastewater. Domestic wastewater includes urine stream, faces, grey water and toilet flushing water. The wastewater contains key nutrients such as potassium (K), Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorous (P). The nutrient removal in WWTP is a critical step before the treated water is either recycled or discharged into natural water bodies. The regulations are becoming more stringent recently and limits to nutrient discharge have been reduced significantly in last three decades. For WWTP, it is becoming extremely hard to keep the wastewater treatment cost low with changing regulations and increased nutrient loading and contaminants in the wastewater. The existing nutrient recovery methods available or currently
under development for recovering nutrients from wastewater such as ammonia stripping, electrochemical methods, membranes based technologies are either expensive or requires major infrastructure upgrade in the existing WWTP. The current proposal is looking at assessing nitrogen recovery from human urine and wastewater using biosolids/biomass derived biochar, which represents a truly circular economy approach and is expected to be an environmentally sustainable and cost-efficient method.
South East Water (SEW) is currently working with RMIT to explore the environmentally sustainable and costefficient method for nutrient recovery from waste water. To accelerate the technology development activities, SEW is keen to work with students/intern who has previous experience in this area. The selected candidate becomes an obvious choice as he has acquired necessary skills and expertise on the same topic during his PhD tenure under the supervision of A/Prof Kalpit Shah."

"A review of nanocellulose as a new material towards environmental sustainability Nanocellulose; Nanocrystal; Nanowhiskers Synthetic polymers, commonly referred to as plastics, are anthropogenic contaminants that adversely affect the natural ecosystems. The continuous disposal of long lifespan plastics has resulted in the accumulation of plastic waste, leading to significant pollution of both marine and terrestrial habitats. Scientific pursuit to seek environment-friendly materials from renewable resources has focused on cellulose, the primary reinforcement component of the cell wall of plants, as it is the most abundantly available biopolymer on earth. This paper provides an overview on the current state of science on nanocellulose research; highlighting its extraction procedures from lignocellulosic biomass. Literature shows that the process used to obtain nanocellulose from lignocellulosic biomass greatly influences its morphology, properties and surface chemistry. The efficacy of chemical methods that use alkali, acid, bleaching agents, ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvent for pre-treatment of biomass is discussed. There has been a continuous endeavour to optimize the pre-treatment protocol as it is specific to lignocellulosic biomass and also depends on factors such as nature of the biomass, process and environmental parameters and economic viability. Nanofibers are primarily isolated through mechanical fibrillation while nanocrystals are predominantly extracted using acid hydrolysis. A concise overview on the ways to improve the yield of nanocellulose from cellulosic biomass is also presented in this review. This work also reviews the techniques used to modify the surface properties of nanocellulose by functionalizing surface hydroxyl groups to impart desirable hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance. An assessment on the emerging application of nanocellulose with an emphasis on development of nanocomposite materials for designing environmentally sustainable products is incorporated. Finally, the status of the industrial production of nanocellulose presented, which indicates that there is a continuously increased demand for cellulose nanomaterials. The demand for cellulose is expected to increase further due to its increasing and broadening applications."

"Glass Fines: A review of cleaning and up-cycling possibilities Slag; Waste Glass; Cathode Ray Tubes Globally, glass is now a common choice for packaging products that are distributed to market. In Australia, over 1.3 million tons of packaging glass is consumed per annum. Each year only around 40% of the used glass in this pool is recovered nationally via a complex system of collection, sorting and re-processing. Thus there is a significant opportunity to recover this waste stream further. Throughout the glass recovery process, glass packaging is progressively broken into ever smaller pieces, to eventually form what is known as Glass Fines. Glass Fines are a hard waste to sort and the lowest value in the mixed waste stream due to their size, colour mix, and the range of non-glass contaminates that are additionally a part of the recovery system. Despite the high value the public holds for glass recycling, Glass Fines are in fact a by-product of a recovery process that enables the systemic degradation of an otherwise perfectly recyclable material. This research presents a review, designed to demonstrate ways that Glass Fines can be repurposed, recycled more effectively, or up-cycled. By matching applications for Glass Fines with waste processing and sorting techniques, realistic market contexts may be realised for this waste stream more readily by industry. Previous studies have approached such applications from resource efficiency and environmental impact perspectives, not from a market context. This research addresses the need for business engagement with Glass Fines applications, providing clarity on economic and technical characteristics of Glass Fines products for those interested in developing such markets. The review was conducted in two stages. The first stage, a literature review of characteristics of Glass Fines, cleaning technologies used to process waste glass, and applications for waste glass was undertaken. These data were categorized to identify â€˜fit-for-purposeâ€™ applications for Glass Fines within various industries. In order to encourage maximum valorisation of this waste stream, a set of criteria were developed inductively through the results of the literature search, to apply to the Glass Fines applications to categorise them according to the needs of business and investors. As such applications were arranged by way of these heuristic evaluation criteria to identify opportunities for the interoperability of related processes and markets for Glass Fines. Criteria developed included: â€¢ Market Development - Maturity of the particular application, from experimental phase, to early commercial development, to established industry practice; â€¢ Production Intensity - Energy requirements in the processing raw Glass Fines for the desired application; â€¢ Post Recovery Processing â€“ Level of cleaning required when preparing the Glass Fines for production within a particular application; â€¢ Up-cycling Value - Rating intrinsic value of the end product versus being remanufactured into glass; and â€¢ Macro Market and Market Size - Matching applications within specific industry sectors, and to indicate its possible scale. Through this criteria and associated applications current suppliers and manufactures are provided new potential opportunities working with Glass Fines based on business relevant criteria such as cost, energy intensity and market value. This contribution could lead to future innovation in up-cycling Glass Fines as the global community moves to a more circular economy."

"From action to intra-action? Agency, identity and ‘goals’ in a relational approach to climate change education Education; Posthuman; Materialist Engaging with new materialist/posthuman approaches to agency, in this paper I explore what might happen to the goal of cultivating climate action if we decentre the human from our climate pedagogies. Specifically, I engage with Karen Baradâ€™s concept of intra-action which argues that agency is not possessed by individual things or beings, but emerges through relationships. I work with experiences and occurrences from Climate Change Responses, an undergraduate social science course that I tutored in 2015 (CCR15). I explore how in CCR15, while trying to learn to better mitigate climate change, we became climate killjoys, resisting, challenging and disrupting pleasurable carbon intensive practices. Through these empirical examples, I show that â€˜climate intra-actionâ€™ can enable us to attend to how human and more-than-human identities change through engagement with climate change; how our human capacities to affect climate emerge through acting-with more-than-human entanglements; and thus how unanticipated, different actions can emerge in climate change education. I therefore suggest that an intra-active approach to climate change education research and practice might enable less anthropocentric and more relationally attuned climate change â€˜response-abilitiesâ€™, for both teachers and students."
"JLABS World Without Disease Quickfire Challenge (QFC) RMIT University has developed an advanced handheld personalised nebuliser for inhaled delivery of next generation lung cancer drugs (namely, biologics such as RNAi, DNA, peptides or proteins), making treatment of lung cancer easier, cheaper, safer, more accessible and more effective by directly targeting the site of the tumour. In particular, the novel technology we have developed circumvents limitations associated with competing inhalers or nebulisers on the market for effective lung cancer therapeutics, which primarily are either prohibitively large to permit portable handheld use at the point of need; a one-size-fits-all approach that does not allow dose customisation to a patient?s particular requirements; possess aerosolisation mechanisms that denature the therapeutic molecule; or do not produce sufficient dose necessary for whole lung exposure over inhalation times that are commensurate for practical administration. Support from the Johnson & Johnson Quickfire Challenge will allow us to develop and commercialise this innovation into affordable life-saving technology, which is expected to revolutionise lung cancer therapy given that there is no product for inhaled lung cancer therapeutics currently on the market.

"Criminal record checking and employment: The importance of policy and proximity Criminal Record; Hiring Decisions; Applicant Employment is essential to the rehabilitation of offenders, yet employers routinely check criminal records and rely on them to deny offenders employment. To manage these practices many jurisdictions use spent conviction and anti-discrimination schemes; there have also been recent campaigns aimed at â€˜banning the boxâ€™, requiring that questions about criminal record are deferred to a later point when the person could address them in interview. This article draws on findings from surveys and interviews with human resources personnel about their criminal record checking practices to identify some key concerns of employers and highlight areas for challenging employer practices. The study highlights the influence on employment decisions of external factors â€“ legislation, government policy and industry regulation â€“ and of internal considerations about proximity of the decision maker to the applicant and potential proximity to other staff. The willingness of some employers to engage with applicants opens up the possibilities for people with a criminal record to demonstrate their readiness to desist from offending and to counter stereotypes about offenders. Where there is no scope for, or willingness to attempt, such discretionary engagement, however, it is likely that employers will prioritize a risk-averse approach to employment, pre-emptively excluding potentially productive employees, and putting such ex-offenders at risk of deeper exclusion."

"Systematic planning can rapidly close the protection gap in Australian mammal havens Dingoes; Mammals; Vulpes Vulpes In the last 30 years, islands and fenced exclosures free of introduced predators (collectively, havens) have become an increasingly used option for protecting Australian mammals imperiled by predation by introduced cats (Felis catus) and foxes (Vulpes vulpes). However, Australia's network of havens is not expanding in a manner that maximizes representation of all predator-susceptible taxa, because of continued emphasis on already-represented taxa. Future additions to the haven network will improve representation of mammals most efficiently if they fill gaps in under-represented predator-susceptible taxa, particularly rodents. A systematic approach to expansion could protect at least one population of every Australian predator-susceptible threatened mammal taxon by the addition of 12 new havens to the current network. Were the current haven network to be doubled in number in a systematic manner, it could protect three populations of every Australian predator-susceptible threatened mammal taxon."
"Many IUCN red list species have names that evoke negative emotions Sentiment Classification; Data Mining; Product Review Species common names underpin communication between researchers, stakeholders and the public. Changing unappealing (e.g., rough-skinned horned toad), misleading (e.g., lesser bird of paradise) or even immemorable (e.g., little grassbird) species names could be an effective, and inexpensive, way to improve engagement with and support for threatened species. We use two sentiment lexicons to analyze the common names of 26,794 IUCN Red List animal species to understand which words drive sentiment in species names. Words driving common name sentiment varied across taxonomic class and threat status; highly frequent words associated with human emotions included anger, fear, disgust, and joy. We identified keywords for future targeted research on strategic name changes (e.g., greater, golden, least, lesser, false). This article provides essential grounding for future species common name research and improving public engagement with threatened species."

"Persistence of gender inequality: the role of ethnic divisions China; Institutional Quality; Multicultural Diversity Gender inequality remains a fundamental challenge for global policymakers given that it has detrimental implications for growth and human capital formation. However, studies examining the roots of gender inequality, and what determines the level of inequality are relatively scant. In this study, we seek to contribute to the literature that examines the roots of gender inequality and thus, our objective is to examine the impact of ethnic diversity on gender inequality. We argue that the level of ethnic diversity within a country plays a role in either deepening or bridging gender gaps. Using indices of ethnic fractionalization, we examine the effects of ethnic diversity on measures of gender inequality such as the gender inequality index, and its associated dimensions of empowerment, educational attainment and labour market outcomes. Our evidence suggests that ethnic diversity widens existing gender gaps. We discuss several mechanisms through which ethnic diversity may lead to the increase of existing gender gaps, and lay out various policy approaches to address gender inequality."
"Impact of alginate selection for wastewater treatment by immobilised Chlorella vulgaris Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Rapid nutrient removal from municipal wastewater can be achieved by algae immobilised in beads of alginate. The use of immobilised algae has been limited by the additional costs of immobilisation, hence the selection of an alginate with appropriate properties can improve its viability. Nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) removal, biomass productivity, bead stability, and production cost were criteria used to compare the immobilisation of Chlorella vulgaris in three alginate products: food grade, and two laboratory products with low and medium viscosity. Algal biomass productivity was greater for low viscosity (47 mg/L/d) than both medium viscosity (37 mg/L/d) and food grade (36 mg/L/d) alginate while nutrient removal was independent of alginate product in batch culture. As such, the criteria for alginate selection could be narrowed to bead stability and alginate price. Beads prepared from medium viscosity alginate were the least stable as they lost the most strength over four weeks exposure to wastewater, swelled and released more organic carbon than the other two products. This was attributed to the lower proportion of L-guluronate in the polymer for medium viscosity alginate which led to the Ca-alginate having less cross-linking. Greater cross-linking in the structures of the food and low viscosity Ca-alginates was associated with higher porosity (96.7â€“96.8%) and higher immobilisation efficiency (95â€“97%). As immobilisation in food grade alginate led to similar nutrient removal and little loss of stability in wastewater, despite lower algal growth, its lower cost means it presented as an effective alternative to the laboratory products."

"Effects of distance from canal and degradation history on peat bulk density in a degraded tropical peatland Indonesia; Swamp Forest; Biomass Burning Over recent decades, the combination of deforestation, peat drainage and fires have resulted in widespread degradation of Southeast Asia's tropical peatlands. These disturbances are generally thought to increase peat soil bulk density through peat drying and shrinkage, compaction, and consolidation. Biological oxidation and fires burning across these landscapes also consume surface peat, exposing older peat strata. The prevalence and severity of deforestation, peat drainage and fire are typically greater closer to canals, built to drain peatlands and provide access routes for people. We compared bulk densities of 240 cm peat profiles from intact forests and degraded peatlands broadly, and also assessed differences between degraded peatlands near-to-canals (50â€“200 m from the nearest canal) and far-from-canals (300+ m from the nearest canal). The effects of vegetation type and fire frequency on bulk density, irrespective of the distance from canal, were also investigated. Mean bulk density values ranged between 0.08 and 0.16 g cmâˆ’3 throughout the 240 cm peat profiles. Drainage of peat near-to-canals increased bulk density of peat above the minimum water table depth. Degradation by deforestation and fire also increased bulk densities of upper peat strata, albeit with greater variability. Peat sampled further from canals experienced less intense water table drawdowns, buffering them from drainage effects. These areas were also more commonly forested and burnt less frequently. Differences in bulk densities below minimum water table levels are less clear, but may reflect lowering of the current peat surface in degraded peatlands broadly. These results clearly show that important differences in bulk density exist across degraded peatlands that are spatially dependent on distance from canals and disturbance history. These landscape features should be taken into account when designing future bulk density sampling efforts and peatland restoration programs, or when extrapolating from existing sources in order to make accurate inferences from them."
"Special WSMC edition paper: What is this thing called money? Economic abuse in young adult relationships Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Economics of Scale Purpose: This paper aims to investigate how economic abuse manifests in young adult relationships from the perspective of practice experts to inform the role of social marketing in economic abuse prevention. Practitioners were asked for their views on prevention strategies at the individual, relationship, community and societal levels. Design methodology/approach: Twenty-four experts were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Findings: Experts reported that young adults experienced economic exploitation, adverse economic entanglement and economic control. Young adultsâ€™ frame of reference was a challenge for practitioners. Experts believed that more work needed to be done to improve the financial literacy of young adults. Research limitations/implications: Practitioner views provide one side of the story. A separate study has been established interviewing young adults to explore these issues further. Practical implications: The authors argue that prevention and intervention strategies need to focus on young adults who are in their critical relationship formation stage. The identified attitudinal factors present a challenge to policy, prevention and service providers. Originality/value: The authors shift the attention from service engaged women leaving violent relationships to young adults who have not sought assistance from community or domestic violence services. In doing so, they highlight the importance of the relationship formation phase. This paper raises the challenge for social marketers to consider appropriate prevention and intervention programmes for this cohort. Current and future campaigns and programmes need to be designed and evaluated with an economic abuse lens."
"Water footprint: applying the water footprint assessment method to Australian agriculture Water Footprint; Water-Energy Nexus; Nexus BACKGROUND: Water footprint assessment is essential for the evaluation of water scarcity that considers both direct and indirect water consumption along the supply chain. This paper presents the estimation of water footprint for locally grown fruits and vegetables in Australia. Water footprint was calculated based on the framework developed in the Water Footprint Assessment Manual for the crops which are the most practicable to grow in Australia. Nine different crops (apples, grapes, tomatoes, oranges, peaches/nectarines, cherries, potatoes, carrots/turnips and almonds) in the agricultural industry were selected and identified as the most water-consumptive crop and least water-consumptive crop. For each type of crop, the three main water footprint components (blue, green, and grey water) were calculated. RESULTS: It was found that almond had the highest water footprint (6671.96 m3 tonâˆ’1) and tomato had the lowest water footprint (212.24 m3 tonâˆ’1) in Australia. From the global comparison, it is revealed that total water footprint for Australian crops is much higher than the corresponding international average values, except for tomatoes, potatoes and almonds. Also, almonds had the highest water footprint among the nine crops investigated. CONCLUSION: The study provides an insight into future sustainable cropping patterns in Australia, which suggest that tomatoes, carrots/turnips, potatoes and apples should continue to be grown in Australia, whereas stone fruit (e.g., almonds) should no longer be grown because of its high water footprint.

"Brand meaning and institutional work: The light and dark sides of service employee practices Marketing; Consumer Culture; Netnography Service employees (SEs) are instrumental in shaping customer brand perceptions. However, to deliver favorable brand experiences, SEs may not always abide by socially constructed norms and guidelinesâ€”called institutionsâ€”that coordinate service interactions. We explore how SEs navigate internal and external institutions, and the potential implications for brand meaning outcomes. Drawing on qualitative interviews with SEs from five local and international bank brands in Vietnam, and archival data, we discover 10 practices that function as institutional work and identify potential implications for brand meaning outcomes of authenticity, relevance, and legitimacy. Using institutional theory as an enabling lens, we demonstrate how these practices either disrupt or maintain internal and external institutions with dark-side or light-side consequences for brands. Specifically, our findings uncover how dark-side practices may place brand meaning outcomes at risk and how light-side practices, even those that disrupt institutions, can potentially enhance brand meaning, providing significant theoretical and managerial implications."

"Defining the capable engineer: Non-technical skills that support safe decisions in uncertain, dynamic situations Safety Climate; Accident; Health Management Education and learning are key topics in the safety research literature but the literature focuses primarily on organisational learning from accidents and non-technical skills for those in frontline roles where avoidance of active errors is key. This article addresses the non-technical skills that engineers need in order to make the best long-term choices for public safety while navigating organisational complexity. Previous contributions on engineering education reflect a strong focus on technical competence. Situated in the emerging conversations among education scholars on professional capabilities, we identify the holistic attributes and skills that empower engineers to make the best decisions for safety in uncertain, dynamic situations. Drawing on interviews with 41 engineers in the gas pipeline sector, the analysis develops a framework of individual capabilities for public safety decision-making consisting of 20 core elements. We see these 20 capabilities as falling into six categories: (a) use long-term, foresighted reasoning, especially in the face of uncertainty, (b) understand norms and values that inform actions, (c) think systematically and understand interconnectedness, (d) collaborate with and draw on the experience of others, (e) ground decisions in reality and (f) advocate for action and take responsibility. This capability framework has resonance with comparable work done in the field of sustainability education and extends the safety literature on non-technical skills into a domain where latent errors, rather than active errors, predominate."
"Mining in Papua New Guinea: A complex story of trends, impacts and governance Papua New Guinea; Resource Extraction; Mining Mining is often portrayed as a contributor to sustainable development, especially so in developing countries such as Papua New Guinea (PNG). Since 1970, several large mines have been developed in PNG (e.g. Panguna, Ok Tedi, Porgera, Lihir, Ramu) but always with controversial environmental standards and social impacts often overlooked or ignored. In PNG, mine wastes are approved to be discharged to rivers or oceans on a very large scale, leading to widespread environmental and social impacts â€“ to the point of civil war in the case of Panguna. The intimate links between indigenous communities and their environment have invariably been under-estimated or ignored, leading many to question mining's role in PNG's development. Here, we review the geology of PNG, its mineral resources, mining history, key trends for grades and resources, environmental metrics (water, energy, carbon), mine waste management, and regulatory and governance issues. The study provides a unique and comprehensive insight into the sustainable development contribution of the mining industry in PNG â€“ especially the controversial practices of riverine and marine mine waste disposal. The history of mining is a complex story of the links between the anthroposphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and geosphere. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that the scale of environmental and social impacts and risks are clearly related to the vast scale of mine wastes â€“ a fact which remains been poorly recognised. For PNG, the promise of mining-led development remains elusive to many communities and they are invariably left with significant social and environmental legacies which will last for decades to centuries (e.g. mine waste impacts on water resources). Most recently, the PNG government has moved to ban riverine tailings disposal for future projects and encourage greater transparency and accountability by the mining sector, including its interactions with communities. There remains hope for better outcomes in the future."

"Building the Evidence for Family Violence Policy Reform: The Work of Specialist Women's Refuges in Victoria, Australia Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Help-Seeking While specialist women's refuges have been central to responses to family violence since the 1970s, their work is under-researched. Little is known outside the family violence sector about the support they provide and how it assists women and children. There have been some critiques of their work but there is limited knowledge of the constraints women's refuges face. Based on interviews and focus groups with 100 professional stakeholders and twenty-two service users, this article analyses the work of women's refuges in the Australian state of Victoria in an effort to inform policy reform. The research found that refuges' underpinning gendered analysis, focus on safety and support and advocacy to ensure women's human rights are met have much to offer further developments in responding to family violence. In doing so, the article contributes to critical debates about the operation of refuges and the need for specialist family violence services."
"Fuel poverty and subjective wellbeing Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort We use 13 waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey to examine the effect of fuel poverty on subjective wellbeing (SWB) in Australia. We find that being in fuel poverty lowers SWB. When we instrument for fuel poverty using electricity and gas prices, we find that a standard deviation increase in fuel poverty is associated with declines of 0.168â€“0.458 standard deviations in SWB, depending on how fuel poverty is measured. The general conclusion that fuel poverty lowers SWB is robust to alternative ways of measuring fuel poverty, a suite of estimation approaches and other sensitivity checks."

"Pandemic and teacher retention: empirical evidence from expat teachers in Southeast Asia during COVID-19 Teacher Evaluation; Teacher Labor Markets; Teacher Training Purpose: This research aims to explore the influence of expat teachers' attitude about local policies, and their subjective norms of social engagement during COVID-19 over their intention to leave the current country, due to COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses analysis of variance (ANOVA) and structural equation model (SEM) to examine the perception of crisis and the intention to leave among 307 expat teachers in Southeast Asia during COVID-19 and highlights the importance of policy responses and social engagement toward the minimum teacher turnover rate. Findings: The study reveals that, the higher perceived policy responses and community engagement the teachers acknowledge, the lower chance they will move to another country. Also, this paper presents the differences in expat teachers' perceptions and intentions among demographic factors such as teaching qualification, their current country of teaching, experience at the current country, income before, during and expected income after COVID-19. Originality/value: The paper justifies a conceptual framework which provides a hypothetical explanation about the influence of perceived policy responses and community engagement over expat teachers' intention to leave."

"The impact of accountability mechanisms on public sector environmental sustainability performance: A case study of Sri Lanka Decision Making; Social Impact Assessment; Environmental Impact Statements Asia is the fastest growing economic region that has attracted significant economic and infrastructure development. With increasing development, this region has become one of the main environmental polluters with significant environmental degradation, reduced water and air quality, and imperilled biodiversity. Traditional international donor and funding agencies such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have strict environmental safeguard policies drawn from Sustainable Development Goals, to ensure borrowing countries and projects comply with environmental sustainability. However, with an increasing shift to non-traditional donors such as China, environmental safeguards are not a key priority in developmental projects. The public sector plays a significant role in ensuring environmental sustainability and accountability, and is increasingly being pressured to revisit their concept of sustainability. Robust public sector accountability frameworks are paramount to achieve environmentally sustainable development. However, environmental sustainability research in developing country context is limited, public sector research is even scarce. This paper aims to fill this gap by clarifying the concept of environmental accountability of public sector entities in pursuing internationally funded development projects in Sri Lanka as a fast developing country in the south Asian region. This further analyses the roles and responsibilities of public sector agencies in relation to the environmental sustainability practices and the impact of international development funding agencies, including donor agencies on public sector accountability. The analysis indicates that despite the existing environmental sustainability guidelines and principles set by international agencies, environmental degradation continued to be a significant challenge in the country."

"Common resources-resource bundling-performance: the mediating role of resource bundling in container terminal operations Container Port; Short Sea Shipping; Harbors (Waterways) Purpose: Building on the resource-based view (RBV) perspective of common resources, the objective of this paper is to empirically examine the impact of container terminals' common resources (i.e. government support and terminal resources) on resource bundling strategies and subsequent effect on service performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using cross-sectional survey data collected from a sample of 216 respondents of Indonesia's container terminals, this study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the hypothesised relationships between common resources, resource bundling strategies and service performance. Findings: Government support and terminal resources (personnel and physical), both as sources of common resources when bundled effectively, are found to have positive and significant effect on terminal service performance. The resource bundling strategies fully mediate the relationship between container terminals' common resources and service performance. Practical implications: The study introduces the notion of common resources to container terminal managers in contrast to the valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable (VRIN) types. It is recommended that appropriate resource bundling strategies can turn the common resources into VRIN resources that can be used to obtain desired service performance. Originality/value: RBV theorists suggest that resources that are VRIN types can be the source of competitive advantage. However, the resources can also be common, basic and valuable, a fact that is rarely investigated in the literature. These common resources can be bundled judiciously with other pre-existing resources to create VRIN resources. This research enriches the RBV by empirically validating that VRIN resources are embedded within various common resources bundling strategies."

"Ammonia Synthesis by Alkaline Membrane Based Electrolysis: CSIRO PhD Scholarship (PhD Candidate: Song Huang) Ammonia is produced via the Haber-Bosch process that requires high energy input (~500°C and 150-300 bar) and results in carbon emission (releases about half of the UK CO2 every year) and consumes about 2% of the global fossil fuel energy. Based on the energy content of ammonia (5.2 MWh per tonne), more than 50% of the energy is lost in the synthesis process alone.  Therefore, there is enormous potential for reducing energy losses in synthesis process by developing alternative synthesis route, and that also uses renewable energy, so the process is emission-less. This project aims to directly synthesize ammonia using an alkaline membrane
based electrolysis."

"Feasibility study on green transportation Solar Ponds; Salinity; Exergy This is a research report on a green transportation project. Green transportation relies on renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels currently used extensively. Sustainability assumes low impacts on environment and balancing current and future needs. We are investigating introduction of electrical vehicles (EV) and issues which influence that EVs are rapidly becoming a mainstay in vehicle product lines. These issues are related to the remaining available reserves of fossil fuels, important for the further use of Internal Combustion Engines (ICE), from one side, and on the other side, availability and reserves of lithium and other metals, required for EV batteries and motors, which makes impacts on swiftness of green transportation introduction. This transition to EVs is characterized by the convergence of mobility and energy what can bring significant benefits to the entire society. There are also policy implications which direct the usage of green energy for EV charging and development of related infrastructure. Finally, we present the economics of green transportation and business models which ensure its sustainability."
"Sustainable wine tourism development through the lens of dynamic capabilities and entrepreneurial action: an exploratory four-region perspective Wine; Hedonic Price Function; Implicit Price This study contributes to the sustainable wine tourism literature in various ways. First, using a multi-country approach, the study empirically explores the perceived benefits gained from wine tourism, and the ways in which it could be developed sustainably. These dimensions are examined through the lens of the dynamic capabilities approach and entrepreneurial action. Subsequently, a theoretical framework is proposed to enhance understanding of the development of sustainable wine tourism. Unstructured, in-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 56 winery owners and managers. The two theoretical frameworks help understand the various forms in which sensing and seizing can be materialised in opportunities for wine tourism development, and reconfiguring, or moving forward, to identify ways to achieve its sustainability. Stemming from the findings and the adoption of the theoretical contributions, a strategic toolkit is proposed, which provides guidance to various stakeholders in their efforts to develop a sustainable wine tourism industry."

"Influenza A virus elicits peri-vascular adipose tissue inflammation and vascular dysfunction of the aorta in pregnant mice Death Receptor 3; Decoys; Signal Transduction Influenza A virus (IAV) infection during pregnancy initiates significant aortic endothelial and vascular smooth muscle dysfunction, with inflammation and T cell activation, but the details of the mechanism are yet to be clearly defined. Here we demonstrate that IAV disseminates preferentially into the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) of the aorta in mice. IAV mRNA levels in the PVAT increased at 1â€“3 days post infection (d.p.i) with the levels being ~4â€“8 fold higher compared with the vessel wall. IAV infection also increased Ly6Clow patrolling monocytes and Ly6Chigh pro-inflammatory monocytes in the vessel wall at 3 d.p.i., which was then followed by a greater homing of these monocytes into the PVAT at 6 d.p.i. The vascular immune phenotype was characteristic of a â€œvascular stormâ€- like response, with increases in neutrophils, pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in the PVAT and arterial wall, which was associated with an impairment in endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. IAV also triggered a PVAT compartmentalised elevation in CD4+ and CD8+ activated T cells. In conclusion, the PVAT of the aorta is a niche that supports IAV dissemination and a site for perpetuating a profound innate inflammatory and adaptive T cell response. The manifestation of this inflammatory response in the PVAT following IAV infection may be central to the genesis of cardiovascular complications arising during pregnancy."

"Perpetration of Image-Based Sexual Abuse: Extent, Nature and Correlates in a Multi-Country Sample Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica Image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) is a form of technology-facilitated abuse in which intimate (nude or sexual) images of a person are taken, distributed, or threats are made to distribute the images, without a personâ€™s consent. It is an increasingly criminalized form of sexual abuse, and yet little is known about the perpetrators of these harms, including the extent, relational nature and correlates of perpetration. This article reports on the first multi-country survey study to comprehensively investigate IBSA perpetration. An online panel survey of the general community (aged 16â€“64 years) in the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, and New Zealand (NZ) (n = 6109) found that self-reported IBSA perpetration was relatively common, with one in six (17.5%, n = 1070) respondents engaging in at least one form of IBSA. Logistic regression analyses identified nine characteristics that significantly increased the odds of having engaged in IBSA perpetration during their lifetime, namely: residing in the NZ as opposed to the UK or Australia, being male, having disability/assistance needs, holding attitudes that minimize the harms and excuse the perpetrators of IBSA, engaging in online dating behaviors, engaging in sexual self-image behaviors, and experiencing IBSA victimization (images taken, images distributed, and images threatened). Policy and prevention implications of the findings, as well as directions for future research are discussed."

"Present Situation and Future Trend of Renewable Energy in South Asian Countries: A Review Energy; Energy Poverty; Fuelwood The indemnity of energy around the world has always been a matter of inquietude. The standardization of life and national economy are dependent on the utilization of an adequate amount of energy. Therefore, different initiatives have been taken to maintain a secured future in the energy sector for all the countries in the world. South Asian countries have a tremendous opportunity to create a potential regional collaboration which includes bilateral and multilateral energy deal between the states and a generalized energy policy which can guide future energy security. According to the present scenario of energy conservation, production, and expenditure of the countries in this region, it is seen that integration of cooperation between South Asian countries is necessary. The study describes the renewable energy potentiality and present consumption pattern in South Asian countries. The paper also highlights the future prospect and a sustainable solution for future energy security in this region."
"Downshifting to care: The role of gender and care in reducing working hours and consumption Personnel; Hours of Work; Work Schedules The relationship between working hours and sustainability has attracted research attention since at least the early 2000s, yet the role of care giving in this context is not well understood. Focusing on Australians between 40 and 60 years who have reduced their working hours and income, we explore the relationship between working hours, care giving and consumption. Data from the national census (ABS, 2006, 2011, 2016c) were analysed to contextualise patterns in paid working hours, income and carer roles for men and women aged between 40 and 60 years. Findings from a national survey on informal carers (ABS, 2016a) were also consulted. Taken together, the two sources of national data showed that two thirds of all informal carers are women, that the likelihood of assuming informal carer roles increases with age, and that men and women in carer roles work fewer paid hours per week and have a lower weekly income than non-carers of the same age. To gain qualitative insights into these patterns in Australian national data, and the likely implications of carer roles for household consumption, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten households who subsequently recorded details of their consumption-related expenses over a seven-day period. The interview data showed the strong connection between carer roles, reduced income and paid working hours and its strongly gendered dimension. We argue that women primarily â€˜downshiftâ€™ to undertake care rather than for sustainability motivations and that there is consequently a need to connect scholarship on gender and care with that on downshifting. The link between reducing paid working hours, care-giving and household consumption appeared to be less straight forward and varied between households. Our findings suggest that a complex relationship exists between environmental and social welfare concerns that has policy implications and warrants further exploration."

Findings showed that 37.7% (n = 2,306) of respondents had at least one IBSA victimisation experience since 16 years of age. Logistic regression analyses further identified that demographic characteristics (age, sexuality, disability/assistance), attitudes towards IBSA, and experiential variables (online dating and sexual self-image behaviours, IBSA perpetration) were each predictors of IBSA victimisation. Though gender did not predict the overall extent of IBSA victimisation, the relational contexts and impacts of IBSA remained gendered in particular ways. Implications of the study are discussed with respect to conceptualising gendered violence and future research. PRACTICE IMPACT STATEMENT: This article demonstrates both the diversity of victim experiences of image-based sexual abuse (IBSA), as well as gendered and other patterns in the relational contexts in which it occurs. The findings presented here may assist researchers and practitioners by promoting understanding of the diverse contexts of IBSA, and in turn informing policy, response options and ultimately prevention of IBSA victimisation targeted for different abuse experiences."

"Shifting practices: How the rise of rooftop solar PV has changed local government community engagement Household Energy; Energy; Smart Meters Australian local governments develop and deliver a range of community engagement programmes designed to reduce household-based greenhouse gas emissions. This article draws on practice theory to analyse how these programmes have changed over time in response to the rapid deployment of a domestic renewable energy technology: rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV). After outlining the practice â€œlensâ€ used to analyse these practices, we draw on empirical research to examine traditional forms of climate change community engagement practice including meanings of leadership adopted by local governments. We note how these play out in the form of ambitious community-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets that favour technological responses to climate change which in turn has favoured the rise of rooftop solar PV, and how community engagement practices have changed as a result. We find that Australian local government climate change community engagement practices have experienced three distinct forms of performance. The first, what might be termed â€œtraditionalâ€ climate change community engagement practices, rely upon individuals acting out of adherence to pro-social environmental values. The second highlights the technology of rooftop solar PV with its associated pro-individual motivations, such as financial benefit. The third form, which is currently emerging, positions local governments as â€œdisruptorsâ€ of centralised energy systems mobilising rooftop solar PV amongst actors currently excluded from the solar revolution, such as renters, low income households and community energy groups. In extending the meanings of rooftop solar PV uptake beyond financial benefits to a shared response to climate change, local governments become active agents in mobilising community energy transitions."

"A Perspective Review on the Role of Nanomedicine in the Modulation of TNF-TNFR2 Axis in Breast Cancer Immunotherapy Type II Tumor Necrose Factor Receptor; Adalimumab; Human TNF Protein In the past decade, nanomedicine research has provided us with highly useful agents (nanoparticles) delivering therapeutic drugs to target cancer cells. The present review highlights nanomedicine applications for breast cancer immunotherapy. Recent studies have suggested that tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and its receptor 2 (TNFR2) expressed on breast cancer cells have important functional consequences. This cytokine/receptor interaction is also critical for promoting highly immune-suppressive phenotypes by regulatory T cells (Tregs). This review generally provides a background for nanoparticles as potential drug delivery agents for immunomodulators and further discusses in depth the potential of TNF antagonists delivery to modulate TNF-TNFR2 interactions and inhibit breast cancer progression."
"The Effect of Culture on Performance Expectancy, Intention, and Trust in Mobile Payment Adoption Technology Acceptance Model; Mobile Payment; E-Learning This study aims to investigate the role of culture at an individual level in the context of m-payment adoption. Specifically, it examines the effect of uncertainty avoidance and collectivism based on the Hofstede cultural dimensions on three important constructs in technology adoption as well as m-payment adoption, which are performance expectancy, behavioural intention, and consumer trust. The data was collected in Vietnam, which ranked first in m-payment development worldwide in 2019, to test the hypotheses. The findings confirmed the significant impact of cultural variables in the context of mobile payment adoption. The positive and significant impacts of performance expectancy on behavioural intention and consumer trust and consumer trust on behavioural intention are also confirmed, which are aligned to previous studies. This research contributes to the body of literature of not only m-payment adoption but also the impact of culture in m-payment adoption in particular and technology adoption in general."
"Online and social media resilience in young people in vulnerable contexts Cyberbullying; Crime Victims; Workplace Bullying This Australian study explored the resilience to online abusive activity and enticements to violence amongst a cohort of young people in vulnerable contexts. The vulnerable contexts were defined as those where family disruption, domestic violence and subsequent geographical dislocation were present in the young personâ€™s environment. The young people, aged 12 to 19 years, were interviewed to elicit the prevalence of abusive or violent online and social media behaviours and were invited to discuss the resilience strategies they used to deal with such behaviours. Whilst resilience to online abusive activity has been studied in some depth, the prevalence of such activity and its effect upon young people in domestic violence or other abusive contexts has not. This study which examined the first-hand responses of a small number of young people in domestic violence contexts, found that the resilience strategies were dependent upon the maturity of the individual, the perceived support mechanisms available to the young person, the peer group attitude and the emotional attachment to the peer group. The results broadly match resilience strategies evident in the existing literature but add new knowledge about the significance of the maturation process and its effect upon resilience strategies for vulnerable youth. The study provides new insights into the development of resilience in online or social media contexts for young people in vulnerable contexts."

"Bloody flukes: a review of aporocotylids as parasites of cultured marine fishes Opecoelidae; Digenea (Trematoda); Animals Fish blood flukes (Digenea: Aporocotylidae) are important pathogens of fishes in aquaculture. Severe infections have been associated with mass mortality events in cultured marine species of teleosts in Australia, Asia and Europe, leading to significant socio-economic losses. Here we review recent advances towards understanding the biology and ecology of fish blood flukes, and the integral role molecular techniques have played in this development. Techniques include molecular matching of aporocotylid life stages using ITS-2 rDNA, and targeting ITS-2 rDNA to distinguish aporocotylid species using quantitative PCR (qPCR). These approaches have facilitated the elucidation of multiple life cycles for species of Cardicola infecting bluefin tunas Thunnus spp. cultured in Australia and Japan. Continued work to identify intermediate hosts of fish blood flukes is critical to improve understanding of their life cycles and help inform aquatic animal health management e.g. through site selection and/or separation of intermediate and definitive hosts. As praziquantel is the only known treatment option for infected fish, its continued efficacy will need to be monitored and other possible solutions may need to be identified as aquaculture continues to grow and diversify."

"Assessing the Plant Growth Promoting and Arsenic Tolerance Potential of Bradyrhizobium japonicum CB1809 Soil; Nodulation; Nitrogen Fixation Accumulation of heavy metals in soil is of concern to the agricultural production sector, because of the potential threat to food quality and quantity. Inoculation with plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPR) has previously been shown to alleviate heavy metal stress but the mechanisms are unclear. Potential mechanisms by which inoculation with Bradyrhizobium japonicum CB1809 affected the legume soybean (Glycine max cv. Zeus) and the non-legume sunflower (Helianthus annus cv. Hyoleic 41) were investigated in solution culture under 5 Î¼M As stress. Adding As resulted in As tissue concentrations of up to 5 mg kgâˆ’1 (shoots) and 250 mg kgâˆ’1 (roots) in both species but did not reduce shoot or root biomass. Inoculation increased root biomass but only in the legume (soybean) and only with As. Inoculation resulted in large (up to 100%) increases in siderophore concentration but relatively small changes (Â±10â€“15%) in auxin concentration in the rhizosphere. However, the increase in siderophore concentration in the rhizosphere did not result in the expected increases in tissue N or Fe, especially in soybean, suggesting that their function was different. In conclusion, siderophores and auxins may be some of the mechanisms by which both soybean and sunflower maintained plant growth in As-contaminated media."

"Roughness Optimization of Road Networks: An Option for Carbon Emission Reduction by 2030 Pavements; Road Maintenance; Roads The Paris climate agreement requires all nations to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accordingly, countries have made ambitious targets to be achieved by 2030. Road transport as a major GHG contributor has been embraced by electric vehicle and renewable energy (EV&RE) initiatives to reduce emissions. However, the projected EV&RE penetration by 2030 is small in contributing to the emission reduction targets. On the other hand, life cycle carbon footprint assessment of road infrastructure identifies that rolling resistance due to road roughness contributes most of the GHG emissions. Reduction of networkwide roughness level is often difficult to achieve because of an ever-constrained funding regime. This study found that roughness level can be optimised with both carbon emission reduction and positive benefit-cost outcomes. This result may, therefore, help in achieving important road sector contributions toward 2030 emission reduction targets."
"iMOVE Top-up scholarship - Integrating MaaS into public transport journeys for users with a focus on vulnerable travellers The transport industry is experiencing a period of transformation with new technologies, products, and services to
provide citizens in urban and rural areas with better mobility. Mobility as a Service (MaaS) offers travellers a onestop platform to seamlessly plan and pay for various mobility services which are convenient, sustainable, and
cheaper.

So far, most services have targeted urban residents with no or limited attention to societal goals such as equitable
access and fairness. This PhD Project will focus on smart adoption of MaaS with the purpose of providing vulnerable
travellers (e.g., elderly and people with disabilities) with equitable mobility services.

This project will employ Machine Learning techniques to better understand user activity patterns, travel behaviour,
and mode preferences. Smart card data, automatic vehicle location data, travel mode choice data, and Census data
(to identify population density based on disability and age) will be used as input to machine learning models.

Based on the insights from the model, and considering public transport as the transit backbone, the aim is to achieve
an informed strategy to effectively integrate other available means of transport and new modes (e.g., electric
vehicles) via MaaS framework to provide vulnerable population with fair access to transport."

"Impact of Methanol Photomediated Surface Defects on Photocatalytic H2 Production Over Pt/TiO2 Photocatalytic Activity; Oxygen Vacancies; Titanium Dioxide Co-catalysts play a critical role in enhancing the efficiency of inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts; however, synthetic approaches to tailoring co-catalyst properties are rarely the focus of research efforts. A photomediated route to control the dispersion and oxidation state of a platinum (Pt) co-catalyst through defect generation in the P25 titania photocatalyst substrate is reported. Titania photoirradiation in the presence of methanol induces long-lived surface defects which subsequently promote the photodeposition of highly dispersed (2.2 Â± 0.8 nm) and heavily reduced Pt nanoparticles on exposure to H2PtCl6. The optimal methanol concentration of 20 vol% produces the highest density of metallic Pt nanoparticles. Photocatalytic activity for water splitting and associated hydrogen (H2) production under UV irradiation mirrors the methanol concentration employed during the P25 photoirradiation pretreatment, and resulting Pt loading, resulting in a common mass-normalized H2 productivity of 3800 Â± 130 mmol gPtâˆ’1 hâˆ’1. Photomediated surface defects (arising in the presence of a methanol hole scavenger) provide electron traps that regulate subsequent photodeposition of a Pt co-catalyst over P25, offering a facile route to tune photocatalytic efficiency."
"Assessment of melting and dripping effect on ignition of vertically discrete polypropylene and polyethylene slabs Flames; Burning Rate; Weightlessness This contribution experimentally and analytically addresses the dripping and ignition mechanism of vertically discrete polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) slabs. 3-, 5- and 8-mm-thick samples with 3â€“15 cm spacings were employed to explore the influence of sample thickness and spacing on dripping behaviors and ignition time of lower slab. An approximate analytical model incorporating the imposed power law heat flux, which is converted from the energy loaded by the dripping droplets, is developed to estimate the ignition time. The results show that PE slabs melt, drip and ignite earlier compared with PP slabs, indicating severer hazard in fire scenarios. For both polymers, thinner slabs result in higher dripping frequency, smaller droplet diameter and consequently shorter ignition time. Nevertheless, vertical spacing has little effect on the former two parameters. When the spacing is lower than 8 cm, irregular variation of ignition time is found due to the combined exertion of thermal radiation from upper slab flame and the droplet heating. However, for spacing larger than 8 cm the upper flame radiation can be ignored and the ignition time increases monotonously. The reliability of the developed model is validated by comparison with experimental measurements."

"Cleaning up Forever Chemicals in Construction: Informing Industry Change Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Per-and polyfluorinated alkyl substance (PFAS) contamination has been found in the construction spoil of many major projects, and there is growing concern about the health and environmental implications of these â€œforeverâ€ chemicals. In a context where construction and tunneling have experienced substantial growth, Australia and other countries are still developing their PFAS management. This study used convergent interviews to surface the key common issues that are associated with the management of PFAS contamination in the construction industry. The construction industry appears stuck in their ways and extremely financially driven. Regulation is not working because of poor enforcement and policing from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA could look to employ individuals with more construction industry experience in order to become a strong regulator in the industry, as well as to streamlining decision-making processes, while maintaining quality. To speed up changes in the management of PFASs within the construction industry, large organizations could be targeted by the relevant sustainability rating scheme, and there could be further use of the alliance models to research, develop, and implement PFAS treatment methods."
"Observational-based study to explore pedestrian crossing behaviors at signalized and unsignalized crosswalks Crosswalks; Pedestrians; Safety Despite many studies on exploring the behaviors of pedestrians crossing the road, there is a need for comprehensive studies that identify the factors that may influence pedestrians crossing behavior at signalized and unsignalized intersections. This study aims to comprehensively examine the influence of gender, age group, group-crossing, technological devices and carrying items on pedestrians crossing behaviors at signalized and unsignalized crosswalks simultaneously. Observational data of 552 pedestrians at two signalized and two unsignalized crosswalks in Tehran were collected. Temporal and spatial violations, conflict experience and collision avoidance, situational awareness, and pedestrians crossing speed were used as pedestrians crossing behaviors indicators. To model crossing behaviors, linear mixed models (LMMs) and Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with fixed-effect approach were applied for the continuous outcome (pedestriansâ€™ crossing speed) and binary outcomes, respectively. Phi and Cramer's V coefficients were used to avoid multicollinearity. Results showed that traffic checks before and while crossing showed a high positive correlation with crossing at â€œdon't walkâ€ and flashing â€œdon't walkâ€ signals and conflict experience at signalized crosswalks. As compared to females, males started their crossing more on flashing â€œdon't walkâ€ signal and crossed the crosswalk faster. Older pedestrians exhibited more cautious behaviors at signalized intersections but less in unsignalized intersections. Alone pedestrians behaved more cautiously than groups and crossed the crosswalk more quickly. Using technological devices, regardless of their types, caused pedestrians to not exhibit one or more safe crossing indicators considered in this study. Pedestrians talking on their phones had the least cautious behaviors. Pedestrians listening to music mostly looked at the ground or straight direction rather than looking left-right for traffic. The findings from this study are a valuable resource to road authorities and policy makers to develop appropriate targeted strategies to prevent pedestriansâ€™ injuries and fatalities and improve crosswalks safety."
"Higher Education in Times of Instability and Disruption: Rethinking Notions of Values, Value Creation and Instructional Practices in Vietnam and beyond Employability; Competency; Soft Skills The disruptive nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a massive shift in instructional practices in higher education across the globe. The impact of this pandemic on education globally has led to a surge in online teaching and the use of various digital technologies and platforms to support instructional practices. However, this world-changing event has foregrounded the limitations of technology in addition to other important indications, particularly as it relates to the notion of value and by extension value creation. Within the context of the Vietnamese higher education ecosystem, what is evident is that a re-evaluation of values is worth considering, in terms of the value of local higher education institutions, in addition to the value creation produced by the same. This article will engage with pertinent implications for the post-COVID realities which offer untold challenges and opportunities in Vietnam and elsewhere. Moreover, the post-COVID realities of late modernity only serve to accentuate the importance of values and value creation in this context as higher education institutions would re-evaluate, rethink, and retool approaches to instructional practices. A focus on questions of value aids in considering the broader conditions and contexts which support some of the fruitful and situated outcomes of higher education which includes human capital development, employment, social mobility and the production of modern social identities."

"Recognising the value of urban runoff and reclaimed water for cultural flows in melbourne: implementation through the planning scheme Indigenous Population; Aboriginal; Canada In Australia, contestation over the use of water resources remains fierce and these contests extends into regional cities and urban capitals. The 2008 Echuca Declaration by the Murray Lower Darling Indigenous Nations called for a share of these water entitlements to be legally and beneficially owned by First Nations with an associated right to use such resources for economic liberation â€“ termed as â€˜Cultural Flowsâ€™. This was necessary because of the inadequacies First Nations of the Murrayâ€“Darling Basin encountered when seeking legal recognition of their cultural rights to water; but as the literature has shown these difficulties are not unique to just First Nations of the Murrayâ€“Darling Basin. Similar problems confront First Nations throughout Australia, especially so in urban Australia. There is limited research into how Cultural Flows can be procured in cities, or how recycled water and treated urban stormwater runoff might have a part to play in the achievement of cultural water management objectives set by Indigenous communities. Centred on the Victorian planning scheme, this research aims to bridge this gap through a policy analysis of recycled water and urban stormwater runoff governance. From here, how this approach might be implemented is discussed.â€™."
"Techno-economics and Sensitivity Analysis of Microalgae as Commercial Feedstock for Bioethanol Production Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water The foremost purpose of this techno-economic analysis (TEA) modeling was to predict a harmonized figure of comprehensive cost analysis for commercial bioethanol generation from microalgae species in Brunei Darussalam based on the conventional market scenario. This model was simulated to set out economic feasibility and probabilistic assumption for large-scale implementations of a tropical microalgae species, Chlorella vulgaris, for a bioethanol plant located in the coastal area of Brunei Darussalam. Two types of cultivation systems such as closed system (photobioreactorâ€”PBR) and open pond approaches were anticipated for a total approximate biomass of 220 t yearâˆ’1 on 6 ha coastal areas. The biomass productivity was 56 t haâˆ’1 for PBR and 28 t haâˆ’1 for pond annually. The plant output was 58.90 m3 haâˆ’1 for PBR and 24.9 m3 haâˆ’1 for pond annually. The total bioethanol output of the plant was 57,087.58 gal yearâˆ’1 along with the value added by-products (crude bio-liquid and slurry cake). The total production cost of this project was US$2.22 million for bioethanol from microalgae and total bioethanol selling price was US$2.87 million along with the by-product sale price of US$1.6 million. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to forecast the uncertainty of this conclusive modeling. Different data sets through sensitivity analysis also presented positive impacts of economical and environmental views. This TEA model is expected to be initialized to determine an alternative energy and also minimize environmental pollution. With this current modeling, microalgal-bioethanol utilization mandated with gasoline as well as microalgae cultivation, biofuel production integrated with existing complementary industries, are strongly recommended for future applications.

"Robust Decision-Making for Multiparty Renegotiations in Public-Private Partnerships China; Build-Operate-Transfer; Risk Allocations Public-private partnerships (PPPs) increasingly face disputes that have significantly impacted their outcome. These disputes may result in legal actions or renegotiation, which in any case lead to outcomes such as increased contract duration, increased subsidy schemes, or changes in the risk-sharing mechanism between the public and private parties. Statistics have shown that a large number of PPPs go through renegotiations, sometimes even more than once during the concession period. As a result, communities, policy makers, planners, and managers are often challenged by the potential uncertainty stemming from the wide range of outcomes. This paper applies the concept of robust decision-making (RDM) to model renegotiations in a multiactor setting in public-private partnership projects. The analysis is based on a game theory model of the interaction scenarios and their simulation to assess the impact of potential mitigation strategies. The model is applied to the case study of the Tanzania Railway project to showcase the application of the proposed approach."
"Detection of biomarkers relating to quality and differentiation of some commercially significant whole fish using spatially off-set raman spectroscopy Raman Spectroscopy; Bone And Bones; Powdered Foods Aquaculture represents a major part of the worldâ€™s food supply. This area of food production is developing rapidly, and as such the tools and analytical techniques used to monitor and assess the quality of fish need to also develop and improve. The use of spatially off-set Raman spectroscopy (SORS) is particularly well-suited for these applications, given the ability of this technique to take subsurface measurements as well as being rapid, non-destructive and label-free compared to classical chemical analysis techniques. To explore this technique for analysing fish, SORS measurements were taken on commercially significant whole fish through the skin in different locations. The resulting spectra were of high quality with subsurface components such as lipids, carotenoids, proteins and guanine from iridophore cells clearly visible in the spectra. These spectral features were characterised and major bands identified. Chemometric analysis additionally showed that clear differences are present in spectra not only from different sections of a fish but also between different species. These results highlight the potential application for SORS analysis for rapid quality assessment and species identification in the aquaculture industry by taking through-skin measurements."

"Arsenic concentrations and dietary exposure in rice-based infant food in Australia Pteris Vittata; Cadmium; Hyperaccumulators Rice-based products are widely used to feed infants and young children. However, the association of rice-based products and high arsenic (As) concentrations have been investigated in a number of studies, but there is limited information from Australia. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the As concentration and dietary exposure in infant rice milk, cereal, crackers and pasta as well as to investigate the relationship between As concentration and rice content, rice type and product origin. Total arsenic (tAs) concentrations were determined by nitric acid digestion and ICP-MS while inorganic arsenic (iAs) was determined by acid extraction, followed by ICP-MS with an interfaced hydride generation system. Nearly 75% of samples had inorganic As exceeding the EU maximum levels for infants and children (0.1 mg kgâˆ’1) and the mean iAs percentage of total reached as high as 84.8%. High tAs concentration was positively correlated with rice content and also related to brown (wholegrain). Estimates of dietary exposure showed that infants consuming large amounts of rice pasta or crackers will have an increased risk of health impact associated with excess intake of As through dietary exposure. Moreover, the current Australian guidelines for As in rice (1 mg kgâˆ’1) are above the WHO or EU guideline and therefore, will be less protective of high sensitivity consumers like infants and children."
"Plastic Repurpose for Indigenous Australia  Dr de Waal and his team of students obtained the design blueprints to build the extrusion machine, compression machine and an injection machine and they need funding to do this in semester 2, 2018. A project web site has been set up at https://www.plasticrepurpose.org/. However, part of his students’ project tasks this semester was to determine the best course of action in terms of ‘buy or make’ decision. Unlike the case with the shredder, it is not important to have these machines self-produced, so they are looking at obtaining the required performance at the best possible price from China.  His students’ report is due on 1 June when the decision shall be made whether to make or build the remaining machines. Ready for purchase machines are not available in Australia but are available off-the-shelf from China and should this be the best option it will reduce the lead time to establishing their pilot plant. If the decision is to build the machines the funding will be used to contract Make & Create to assist Gerrit’s students in completing the rest of the pilot plant. If the decision is to procure the team shall order the machines from China and conduct initial test runs to experiment and demonstrate the functionality and performance of the machines and to document the integrated processes. ‘Proof of concept’ is very important as some technical and operational challenges are anticipated that must be satisfactory addressed before the team can commission production plants elsewhere. The pilot plant will be operational by the end of November 2018 and a baseline business model will be ready at the same time to deliver production plants to operators in regional communities and train them."

"Multiplexing physical stimulation on single human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes for phenotype modulation E 4031; Tissue Engineering; Cardiac Muscle Cell Traditional in vitro bioengineering approaches whereby only individual biophysical cues are manipulated at any one time are highly inefficient, falling short when recapitulating the complexity of the cardiac environment. Multiple biophysical cues are present in the native myocardial niche and are essential during development, as well as in maintenance of adult cardiomyocyte (CM) phenotype in both health and disease. This study establishes a novel biofabrication workflow to study and manipulate hiPSC-CMs and to understand how these cells respond to a multiplexed biophysical environment, namely 3D shape and substrate stiffness, at a single cell level. Silicon masters were fabricated and developed to generate inverse patterns of the desired 3D shapes in bas relief, which then were used to mold the designed microwell arrays into a hydrogel. Polyacrylamide (PAAm) was modified with the incorporation of acrylic acid to provide a carboxylic group conjugation site for adhesion motifs, without compromising capacity to modulate stiffness. In this manner, two individual parameters can be finely tuned independently within the hydrogel: the shape of the 3D microwell and its stiffness. The design allows the platform to isolate single hiPSC-CMs to study solely biophysical cues in the absence of cell-cell physical interaction. Under physiologic-like physical conditions (3D shape resembling that of adult CM and 9.83 kPa substrate stiffness that mimics muscle stiffness), isolated single hiPSC-CMs exhibit increased Cx-43 density, cell membrane stiffness and calcium transient amplitude; co-expression of the subpopulation-related MYL2-MYL7 proteins; and higher anisotropism than cells in pathologic-like conditions (flat surface and 112 kPa substrate stiffness). This demonstrates that supplying a physiologic or pathologic microenvironment to an isolated single hiPSC-CM in the absence of any physical cell-to-cell communication in this biofabricated platform leads to a significantly different set of cellular features, thus presenting a differential phenotype. Importantly, this demonstrates the high plasticity of hiPSC-CMs even in isolation. The ability of multiple biophysical cues to significantly influence isolated single hiPSC-CM phenotype and functionality highlights the importance of fine-tuning such cues for specific applications. This has the potential to produce more fit-for-purpose hiPSC-CMs. Further understanding of human cardiac development is enabled by the robust, versatile and reproducible biofabrication techniques applied here. We envision that this system could be easily applied to other tissues and cell types where the influence of cellular shape and stiffness of the surrounding environment is hypothesized to play an important role in physiology."

"An Eco-systems Approach to Climate Impacts on Farmer Wellbeing in Konya Closed Basin Agriculture; Indo-Gangetic Plain; Tillage The aim of this study was to examine the impacts of climate change on the wellbeing of farmers in Konya, Turkey. An ecosystems approach was adopted to take a holistic view of the range of inter-related ecological factors. A focus was on psychological and social impacts with a comparison of impacts on farmers engaged in traditional agriculture and those who had adopted conservation agriculture farming practices. Individual interviews and focus groups were conducted with farmers and agricultural workers to gain an increased understanding of the impact of climate change on their wellbeing. The study found that all farmers were under considerable psychological stress and that the introduction of new farming practices such as conservation agriculture led to increased stress in the early stages of adoption. Implications for the psychological and social support of farmers, particularly in the early stages of adoption of new farming practices are highlighted."
"Impact of natural compounds on neurodegenerative disorders: From preclinical to pharmacotherapeutics Alpha Synuclein; Lewy Bodies; Parkinson Disease Among the major neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), are a huge socioeconomic burden. Over many centuries, people have sought a cure for NDDs from the natural herbals. Many medicinal plants and their secondary metabolites are reported with the ability to alleviate the symptoms of NDDs. The major mechanisms identified, through which phytochemicals exert their neuroprotective effects and potential maintenance of neurological health in ageing, include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiapoptotic, acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase inhibition and neurotrophic activities. This article review the mechanisms of action of some of the major herbal products with potential in the treatment of NDDs according to their molecular targets, as well as their regional sources (Asia, America and Africa). A number of studies demonstrated the beneficial properties of plant extracts or their bioactive compounds against NDDs. Herbal products may potentially offer new treatment options for patients with NDDs, which is a cheaper and culturally suitable alternative to conventional therapies for millions of people in the world with age-related NDDs."

"Four ecotourism archetypes: expressing symbolic desires Travel Motivation; Music Festival; Destination Most ecotourism research focuses on logical, expressed desires, while deeper meanings (or symbolic desires), are less well understood, perhaps because elicitation is difficult. Consequently, prior research is relatively limited on the deeper motivations driving ecotourism behaviour. To address that lack, an ethnographic study of nature-based tourism activities in Malaysia and a symbolic interactionist approach is taken to unpack hedonic meaning-making. The data gave rise to four ecotourist archetypes: The champion, the adherent, the acolyte, and the spa-goer, for ecotourists seeking trial, spiritual, learning and purification benefits, respectively. The study provides both greater insight into how to use ethnographic research to elicit symbolic desires in ecotourism, and practitioner support for the design and delivery of more fulfilling nature-based tourism experiences. The archetypes can be viewed as a symbolic benefits-based market segmentation schema, forming the basis for developing more effective targeting, positioning, branding and value propositions for nature-based tourism activities."

"Using survival theory models to quantify extinctions Animals; Campephilus Principalis; Extinct Species Extinctions are difficult to observe and typically are inferred from the timing and reliability of field observations and collections. Recent advances in approaches to estimating extinction probability consider the type, timing and certainty of records, the timing, scope and severity of threats, and the timing, extent and reliability of surveys. Here we describe a new approach to inference of extinction that uses survival theory, an approach that has a long history of effective use in other disciplines that confront similar problems. The model takes into account uncertainties in input parameter estimates and provides bounds on estimates of the extinction probability for the case in which a species has not been detected following some specified time. We illustrate application of the model using information for dodos and Aldabra snails. This approach provides an alternative perspective on the models underlying the techniques for inferring extinction. It should provide reliable estimates of recent extinction rates."
"Life cycle assessment of apparel consumption in Australia Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing This study presents the environmental impact of apparel consumption in Australia using life cycle assessment methodology according to ISO14040/14044:2006. Available published references, the Ecoinvent v3 dataset, the Australian life cycle assessment dataset and apparel country-wise import data with the breakdown of apparel type and fibre type were used in this study. The environmental impact assessment results of the functional unit were scaled up to the total apparel consumption. The impact results were also normalized on a per-capita/year basis. The Total Climate Change Potential (CCP) impact from apparel consumption of 2015 was estimated to be 16 607 028 tonnes CO2eq and 698.07 kg CO2eq/per capita-year. This study also assessed the impact of acidification potential (AP), water depletion (WD), abiotic resource depletion potential (ADP) - fossil fuel and agricultural land occupation (ALO) using the same methodology. The market volume of cotton apparel in Australia is 53.97 %, which accounts for 45 %, 96 %, 40 %, 46 % and 79 % of total CCP, WD, ADP, AP and ALO impact, respectively. Apparel broad categories of cotton shirt, cotton trouser, polyester shirt and polyester trouser have a high volume in the apparel market as well as a high environmental impact contribution. These high-volume apparel products can be included in the prioritization list to reduce environmental impact throughout the apparel supply chain. It was estimated that from 2010 to 2018 the per capita apparel consumption and corresponding impact increased by 24 %."

"On being posthuman in human spaces: critical posthumanist social work with interspecies families Animal Assisted Therapy; Service Dogs; Animals Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes a critical posthumanist orientation to social work as an approach to address the impediments to care experienced by interspecies families. Secondly, it challenges the anthropocentric assumptions that underpin this exclusion of nonhuman family members in human services disciplines such as social work. Design/methodology/approach: This article presents primary data from a qualitative study into social work and other human services practice in the family violence and homelessness sectors in the state of Victoria, Australia. Findings: Social workers undertook companion animal-inclusive practice to counter vulnerability to interspecies families caused by gender- and species-based violence, and by homelessness. Gender- and species-based violence was exacerbated by a lack of refuge options, and contributed to women considering their companion animals to be their children. The vulnerability that homelessness brought upon interspecies families was amplified by stigma within and external to social work and related professions, and the impediment that experiences of homelessness had on being able to provide care for their nonhuman family members. These factors shaped practice with interspecies families. Scope for future practice was also identified. Research limitations/implications: The research findings can be used to inform policy change that includes consideration of nonhuman family members, as well as critical posthuman program design in social work education. Originality/value: Companion animal-inclusive practice with interspecies families in social work is an under researched area, and there is little empirical data available on the nature of this work in Australia. This paper addresses this gap by centring social workers' own accounts of practice. This paper has scope to contribute to education in social work and other welfare fields, with the potential to empower students to challenge assumptions about social work being solely focused on human-centred concerns."

"Blockchain and the evolution of institutional technologies: Implications for innovation policy Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things For the past century economists have proposed a suite of theories relating to industrial dynamics, technological change and innovation. There has been an implication in these models that the institutional environment is stable. However, a new class of institutional technologiesâ€”most notably blockchain technologyâ€”lower the cost of institutional entrepreneurship along these margins, propelling a process of institutional evolution. This presents a new type of innovation process, applicable to the formation and development of institutions for economic governance and coordination. This paper develops a replicator dynamic model of institutional innovation and proposes some implications of this innovation for innovation policy. Given the influence of public policies on transaction costs and associated institutional choices, it is indicated that policy settings conductive to the adoption and use of blockchain technology would elicit entrepreneurial experiments in institutional forms harnessing new coordinative possibilities in economic exchange. Conceptualisation of blockchain-related public policy an innovation policy in its own right has significant implications for the operation and understanding of open innovation systems in a globalised context."

"Preceptor education for specialty community-based nurses: A pre- and postevaluation Preceptorship; Nursing Students; Mentor Background: Quality preceptorship is an integral aspect of nursing education. Evidence suggests that preceptor education programs can be designed to support RNs in their capacity as preceptors. Little has been reported on the effectiveness of preceptor programs for community-based nurses who provide primary health care for preschool children and their families. Method: The project evaluated the effectiveness of a 4-hour face-to-face tailored preceptor education program undertaken by 59 nurses in Victoria, Australia. Pre- and postsurveys were undertaken to evaluate the program. Results: Participants had improved understanding of the role of preceptor after the education program. They had increased confidence in their ability to give feedback, assess clinical skills, and use the clinical assessment tool. They were also surer of the standard of performance expected of students. Conclusion: A strategically designed preceptor program was effective in improving some preceptorship skills of community-based nurses who supervise postgraduate nursing students."

"Asymmetric impacts of monetary policy and business cycles on bank risk-taking: Evidence from Emerging Asian markets Bank Lending Channel; Loans; Credit Rationing The paper examines the asymmetric impacts of monetary policy and business cycles on bank risk-taking. Using a sample of 212 banks in 13 emerging Asian economies over 2009â€“2019, the findings claim that the impacts of monetary policy and macroeconomic fluctuations are conditional on bank-individual characteristics. Our research has highlighted the procyclicality of bank risk-taking. Banks are more stable during boom cycles and riskier during bust cycles. Furthermore, the impacts of economic upturns and downturns also depend on bank-specific features, such as size, liquidity, and capitalisation. We provided further evidence demonstrating that bank size, capitalisation, efficiency, and diversity also play a vital role in reducing the adverse consequences of an expansionary monetary policy on bank risk-taking. Policy discussions are also discussed."
"Connecting the grids: A review of blockchain governance in distributed energy transitions Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things Critical effects of global climate change urgently call for socio-technical transitions towards more efficient, flexible and cleaner energy systems. However, adequate regulatory frameworks and policy incentives are lagging behind. This paper focuses on the governance dynamics shaping technology-enabled transitions towards distributed energy systems. The purpose of this review is to assess the potential role of blockchain technology in enhancing the governance of sociotechnical energy transitions. For this, the paper reviews: (1) the governance arrangements shaping distributed energy transitions, (2) the emergence of blockchain-based solutions in the energy sector (focusing on P2P energy trading platforms) and, (3) the role of the blockchain in overcoming the governance limitations of distributed energy transitions. The study addresses emerging but interrelated niches of academic study from an integral conceptualization and synthesis of the literature. Rather than extensively covering these fields of research, the purpose is to connect these areas of academic knowledge and expand the theoretical understanding stemming from this convergence. The findings show the potential of blockchain-based governance to overcome institutional barriers related to trust-building and enhanced coordination for community-based energy transitions."
"Transport infrastructure and house prices in the long run House Prices; Housing Market; China We examine the effects of transport infrastructure on house prices in the OECD countries over the period 1870 to 2016. We employ both parametric and non-parametric panel data techniques that account for the non-linear and time-varying relationship between transport infrastructure and house prices. Our parametric results, which are based on newly developed panel data models that incorporate interactive fixed effects, suggest that transport infrastructure is positively associated with house prices. The non-parametric estimates suggest a time-varying relationship and that the average positive effect of transport infrastructure has been the case for most of the period we study. We also examine three channels through which transport infrastructure could influence house prices â€“ economic growth, employment, and crime â€“ and find that economic growth is a mechanism through which transport infrastructure transmits to house prices."

"Drivers and challenges for knowledge sharing in an emerging and government driven industry cluster in Saudi Arabia Regional Innovation Systems; Firm; Innovation Networks Underpinned by the Saudi Arabian government's initiative to reduce the country's dependency on oil, this paper examines the drivers and challenges to knowledge sharing in an emerging and government driven industry cluster. National and regional level innovation policies identify clustering as a key enabler of competitive and economic achievement. What is not clear are the mechanisms through which actor proximity enhances value to individual cluster members. While knowledge creation has been associated with cluster effectiveness and individual actor capacity to innovate, there is still a lack of clarity on cluster influence on enabling knowledge sharing during the early development stage of a cluster. In addition, contextual cluster investigations within the Middle East, the GCC and Saudi Arabia in particular, are limited. This article contributes towards closing this gap by analysing knowledge sharing in an emerging government driven cluster in a developing economy, Saudi Arabia."
"Environmental factors affecting the germination and seedling emergence of two populations of an emerging agricultural weed: Wild lettuce (Lactuca serriola) Seed; Germination; Weeds Wild lettuce (Lactuca serriola L.) is a significant emerging agricultural and environmental weed in many countries. This invasive species is now naturalised in Australia and is claimed to cause significant losses within the agricultural industry. Sustainable management of wild lettuce has been hampered by a lack of detailed knowledge of its seed ecology. Laboratory-based studies were performed to examine the potential influence of environmental factors including temperature and light conditions, salinity, pH, moisture availability and burial depth on the germination and emergence of two spatially distant populations of wild lettuce. Results suggested that the germination of wild lettuce seeds occurred across a broad range of temperature conditions (12-h cycle: 30Â°C/20Â°C, 25Â°C/15Â°C and 17Â°C/7Â°C) for both populations. We also found that these seeds are non-photoblastic germination was not affected by darkness, with >80% germination in darkness for both populations at all tested temperature ranges. Germination significantly declined as salinity and osmotic stress increased for both populations, with seeds from the Tempy population were more affected by NaCl >100 mM than seeds from Werribee, but in neither population was there any observed effect of pH on germination (>80% germination in both populations at all tested pH ranges). For both populations, germination significantly decreased as burial depth increased however, the two populations differed with regard to response to burial depth treatment, whereby seeds from the Tempy population had higher emergence than those from Werribee at 0.5 cm burial depth. These results suggest that light-reducing management techniques such as mulching or use of crop residues will be unsuccessful for preventing germination of wild lettuce. By contrast, burial of seeds at a depth of at least 4 cm will significantly reduce their emergence."

"The assessment of sedimentation and water quality status for river catchment management in Kenyir Lake Basin Water Quality; Multivariate Analysis; Nonpoint Source Pollution Kenyir Lake Basin was built to generate hydroelectric power for Peninsular Malaysia. This water body is a promising natural preserved environment and has been attracting the developer to develop tourist spots to fulfill their profit margin. Such approach commonly has been polluting the environment since the past few decades. In the present study, the hydrological and water quality assessment on rivers was carried out to identify the existing physical environment of Kenyir Lake Basin. Samples and in-situ data were collected at 19 stations during the dry and wet season. The obtained data was compared with National Water Quality Standard (NWQS) for Malaysian waters as well as interpreted and analysis using chemometrics technique. Based on the climatology and hydrological data, it has been observed that the sedimentation rate is increasing which may damage the Kenyir Dam turbines in the future. Besides that, the water quality of Kenyir Lake Basin is complied to Class IIB NWQS which is suitable for recreational use with body contact. Similarly, Kenyir Lake Basin is classified as Class III based on Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE) water quality index; which is suitable for body contact recreational activities but requires an extensive treatment. The chemometrics analysis has highlighted total dissolved solid, turbidity (TUR), biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand and salinity have affecting the water quality. Additionally, dissolved oxygen and pH showed higher potential risk toward the environmental process management and monitoring owing to the development surround Kenyir catchment area. The present findings advocate a higher management method to facilitate the preservation and maintain the life of Kenyir Lake Basin."
"Public universities and impacts of COVID-19 in Australia: risk disclosures and organisational change Voluntary Disclosure; Firm; International Financial Reporting Standards Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the COVID-19 pandemic risk disclosures in a sample of annual reports of Australian public universities. These universities rely heavily on fee-paying onshore overseas students. Analysing these risk disclosures is essential to understanding the COVID-19 crisis and the implications for organisational change. Design/methodology/approach: Document analysis and content analysis of the 2019 annual reports of all Victorian public universities were undertaken to identify the disclosure of COVID-19 risk impacts. Applying Laughlin's Habermasian insights of change, the study explores the pathways of change adopted by universities to overcome the risk impacts. However, financial risk disclosures about income from this source were virtually non-existent. Findings: Any risk associated with COVID-19 disclosed was minimal in a qualitative, neutral and constant format. The quality of disclosures was low. Media statements, however, pointed to significant income loss and suggested a strategy of substantial cost-cutting, including employee redundancies, which we identified as morphostatic changes of universities to overcome the risk impacts. Research limitations/implications: The study reveals the risk associated with sector's aggressive growth strategy, jeopardising their financial viability and quality of teaching and research. Practical implications: The findings provide insights to the Australian higher education sector. The low quality of external risk disclosures of these universities suggests an urgent need for transformation. Originality/value: Australian public universities play a crucial role in society. This role will be diminished by a failure to disclose and manage significant risks adequately."

"Evaluation of technological properties, microstructure and predictive glycaemic response of durum wheat pasta enriched with psyllium seed husk Noodles; Pasta; Flour Psyllium seed husk (PSH) is a soluble dietary fibre with interesting health benefits, including reduction in blood glucose level in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Its supplementation in pasta represents a challenge due to a negative impact of high PSH levels on product acceptability. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of the substitution of semolina with different levels of PSH on cooking properties, microstructure and in vitro glycaemic response of pasta. Dry pasta samples enriched with PSH were produced by replacing durum wheat semolina with 25, 50, 75 and 100 g/kg PSH. Cooked enriched pastas were firmer and sticker than the control. Cooking loss increased with increasing PSH levels above 25 g/kg with values below the technological acceptable limit of 80 g/kg. Semolina substitution with 50â€“100 g/kg psyllium was effective in lowering the predictive glycaemic response of enriched pasta in comparison with the control. Scanning electron microscopy and dough rheology (dynamic frequency and temperature sweep tests) suggested that this decrease was related to the formation of fibre aggregates limiting starch swelling. Semolina replacement with 50 g/kg PSH has the potential to provide a health benefit with minimal impact on cooking features of functional pasta."

"The daughter-in-law questions remittances: changes in the gender of remittances among Indian migrants to Australia Transnationalism; Human Migration; Dual Citizenship In this article, I present a cross-generational analysis of the gendered meanings and politics surrounding monetary remittances. Indian female migrants to Australia, who contribute significantly to household incomes, have recently started to question the sources and directions of remittances. This happens when the woman's earnings are sent, without consultation, to the husband's parents for luxuries, while the family in Australia is struggling. Women in paid work also want to send their earnings to their own parents, particularly if there is financial need. Remittances have become a testing ground for the traditional belief that the husband and his family own the money in the patrilineal marital household. It is possible to interpret male control of remittances without consultation as a form of financial abuse of the wife in the sending household. The article draws on two qualitative studies on five decades of Indian migration to Australia covering 203 people from 112 families."

"Host-directed therapy for malaria: host cell signalome as a target (administered by University of Adelaide) Malaria remains a major global public health issue, and drug resistance threatens to nullify recent progress in malaria control. Host-directed therapy is gaining traction in the fight against infectious diseases, because it provides a barrier to drug resistance: the most parsimonious pathway to resistance, the selection of mutated targets, is not available. Until recently, no system-wide data were available on signalling changes in the host cell triggered by infection with any pathogen. To fill this gap, we have developed an approach based on antibody-microarrays directed against human signalling proteins. Proof of principle studies with Hepatitis C virus (Nature Comms 2017) showed that this strategy succeeds in identifying host targets (protein kinases) and lead molecules that can prevent infection. We implemented this approach with Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes and identified several human kinases that are activated by infection. Inhibitors of some of these kinases display high potency in vitro against P. falciparum and P. knowlesi, and impair P. berghei proliferation in mice.
We propose to:
-Elucidate the mechanisms whereby host erythrocyte factors are essential to parasite survival (P. falciparum and P. knowlesi), using kinomics, biochemical and reverse genetics approaches.
-Evaluate the antiparasitic activity of kinase inhibitors from industry that (1) target signalling mechanisms important for Plasmodium growth, (2) have proven safety in healthy volunteers (Phase 1 &2 clinical trials) and progress the most promising compounds through to the humanised mouse infection model.
This project will deliver cost-effective, ready to market, novel antimalarial molecules with high selectivity and untapped modes of action."
"Weekend and weekday associations between the residential built environment and physical activity: Findings from the ENABLE London study Report Cards; Mode Choice; Built Environment Background We assessed whether the residential built environment was associated with physical activity (PA) differently on weekdays and weekends, and contributed to socio-economic differences in PA. Methods Measures of PA and walkability, park proximity and public transport accessibility were derived for baseline participants (n = 1,064) of the Examining Neighbourhood Activities in Built Living Environments in London (ENABLE London) Study. Multilevel-linear-regressions examined associations between weekend and weekday steps and Moderate to Vigorous PA (MVPA), residential built environment factors, and housing tenure status as a proxy for socio-economic position. Results A one-unit decrease in walkability was associated with 135 (95% CI [28; 242]) fewer steps and 1.2 (95% CI [0.3; 2.1]) fewer minutes of MVPA on weekend days, compared with little difference in steps and minutes of MVPA observed on weekdays. A 1km-increase in distance to the nearest local park was associated with 597 (95% CI [161; 1032]) more steps and 4.7 (95% CI [1.2; 8.2]) more minutes of MVPA on weekend days; 84 fewer steps (95% CI [-253;420]) and 0.3 fewer minutes of MVPA (95%CI [-2.3, 3.0]) on weekdays. Lower public transport accessibility was associated with increased steps on a weekday (767 steps, 95%CI [â€“13,1546]) compared with fewer steps on weekend days (608 fewer steps, 95% CI [â€“44, 1658]). None of the associations between built environment factors and PA on either weekend or weekdays were modified by socio-economic status. However, socio-economic differences in PA related moderately to socio-economic disparities in PA-promoting features of the residential neighbourhood. Conclusions The residential built environment is associated with PA differently at weekends and on weekdays, and contributes moderately to socio-economic differences in PA."

"Synthesis and characterization of lotus seed protein-based curcumin microcapsules with enhanced solubility, stability, and sustained release Curcumin; Demethoxycurcumin; Nanocrystal BACKGROUND: Lotus seed protein (LSP) was extracted from lotus seed and used to encapsulate curcumin with or without complexing with pectin. The physicochemical properties of LSP-based microcapsules, including solubility, stability, and in vitro sustained release, were determined. The mechanism of interaction between curcumin, LSP, and pectin was revealed. RESULTS: The encapsulation efficiency of curcumin was found to depend on LSP concentration and was highest (86.32%, w/w) at 50 mg mLâˆ’1. The curcumin in curcuminâ€“LSP and curcuminâ€“LSPâ€“pectin powder particles achieved a solubility of 75.15% and 81.39%, respectively, which was a remarkable enhancement. The microencapsulation with LSP and LSPâ€“pectin matrix showed a significant improvement in the antioxidant activity, photostability, thermostability, and storage stability of free curcumin. The microencapsulated curcumin showed sustained control release at the gastric stage and burst-type release in the subsequent intestinal stage, presenting cumulative release rates of 64.3% and 72.4% from curcuminâ€“LSP and curcuminâ€“LSPâ€“pectin particles after gastrointestinal digestion. The LSPâ€“pectin complex produced microcapsules with higher solubility, smaller particle size, enhanced physicochemical stability, and increased bioaccessibility. Fourier transform infrared, circular dichroism spectra, and differential scanning calorimetry data indicated that the encapsulated curcumin interacted with LSP and pectin mainly through hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions. CONCLUSION: This work shows that LSP can be an alternative encapsulant for the delivery of hydrophobic nutraceuticals with enhanced solubility, stability, and sustained release. The results may contribute to the design of novel food-grade delivery systems based on LSP vehicles, thereby broadening the applications of LSP in the fields of functional food.

"Investigating thermal comfort and energy impact through microclimate monitoring- a citizen science approach Heat Wave; Climate Change; Distributed Lag The increasing frequency of extreme hot days has a considerable impact on health and energy. Heat stress related to high temperatures cause increased rates of mortality and morbidity, particularly amongst vulnerable populations such as those belonging to lower socio-economic groups. Most studies on heat related mortality and morbidity generally use temperatures from weather stations that do not consider the urban heat island (UHI) effect, leading to inaccurate predictions, particularly during heat waves. This study uses data collected by citizen scientists in predicting outdoor thermal comfort as well as indoor heat stress and peak cooling energy for low income housing in Australia. The results show that the outdoor Universal thermal climate index (UTCI) values estimated during hot afternoon ranged from 26 Â°C to 46 Â°C which equate to moderate to extreme heat stress. The indoor Discomfort index (DI) values calculated inside the living and bedrooms were below the heat stress limits (DI < 28) when Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) data was used as the input for calculation. However, indoor DI exceeded the threshold when actual on-ground data was used in the calculations, indicating that people will be at severe risks of heat related illnesses. It was also found that 60% of the time DI exceeded the threshold value as opposed to 2% with the use of BoM data. Furthermore, the peak cooling load was increased by 24% when on-ground data was used. The results show that low income houses and the neighbourhoods where they are located can cause significant heat related health risks which are normally overlooked in typical simulation studies. This study demonstrated a cost-effective way of collecting microclimate data for urban heat island mitigation and adaptation studies."

"Graduate work-readiness challenges in the Asia-Pacific region and the role of HRM Employability; Competency; Soft Skills Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on graduate work-readiness challenges in three Asia Pacific economies (Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia), and the roles of three main stakeholders (government, employers and industry) in the process. The intention of the paper is to design a stakeholderoriented HRM model to address the identified graduate work-readiness challenges. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative triangulation method comprising interviews and focus groups was used with participant samples for each country - Australia (19), Indonesia (19) and Malaysia (15). Stakeholder-oriented HRM theory underpins the conceptual framework for the paper. Findings - All three countries are currently experiencing difficulties attracting graduates with the required portfolio of qualifications, skills and personal capabilities. The reported effects include: constraints on national economic growth, future production structures, and long-term socio-economic development. Based on a review of the work-readiness and stakeholder-oriented HRM theory literature, it is posited that graduate work-readiness challenges can be effectively addressed by HR professionals in partnership with other key stakeholders. Research limitations/implications - The study sought the input of only three stakeholder groups for ascertaining graduate work readiness challenges, there is a strong case to include other groups including students/parents and secondary schools. Social implications - Bridging the graduate skills gap between government, employers and educational institutions is an important area in which HR professionals can contribute by reducing the mismatch between demand and supply through influencing and balancing the interests and goals of key stakeholders. Originality/value - This study makes a contribution to the extant literature as it explores the role of HR professionals in relation to a multiple stakeholder strategy to address these challenges in the less-explored Asia Pacific region."

"Resonant Webs: Innovations in Art Technology for Individuals with Disability In collaboration between RMIT, Jolt (Australia), SlowLabel and Ritsumeikan University (Japan), this project will create novel interactive arts technology aimed at enhancing the participation of individuals with a disability in community arts in Australia and Japan through inclusive online and later face-to-face co-design workshops and public performances. While there is a significant body of practice focused on enhancing participation in physical activity in the community (e.g. through sport), it is critical to understand how interactive digital arts can be used to improve social inclusion outcomes and wellbeing. According to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), it is important for individuals to participate in physical recreation and social activities. Based on previous joint pilot projects between Ritsumeikan University, RMIT and Jolt, we will conduct co-design workshops and performances that enable healthy people and people with special needs to participate together in creative activities that promote social inclusivity."
"Valuation of collateralized debt obligations: An equilibrium model Credit Default Swaps; Costs And Cost Analysis; Credit Risk In this paper, we present a new equilibrium model for pricing collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The model is grounded on option pricing theory and features a random jump size to account for default correlation across reference entities. This feature is important for pricing CDOs during times of market turmoil. Simulation results show that jump size volatility, capturing uncertainty about the size of simultaneous corporate defaults, is a key parameter in pricing CDOs. The effect of jump size volatility on CDO spreads is substantial and depends on the relative position of the mean jump size to loss-coverage limits."
"Landfill levy imposition on construction and demolition waste: Australian stakeholders' perceptions Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management With increased construction activities in capital cities of Australia, the sustainable management of construction and demolition (C&D) has become an important item in the federal and state government agendas. According to the universally accepted concept of waste hierarchy waste disposal is the worst preferred waste management option due to environmental issues. Currently, in most Australian jurisdictions, a landfill levy is applied to discourage waste disposal and to further encourage waste recovery. However, there is an ongoing debate as to whether the levy regime could achieve the desired outcome. Therefore, this study, funded by the Australian Sustainable Built Environment National Research Centre, explored the effectiveness of the current landfill levy across Australian jurisdictions. The paper presents the findings of this study that were obtained from a questionnaire survey aiming to capture the main C&D waste management stakeholders on landfill taxing imposition in Australia. The study collected 132 responses from professionals in the construction industry and other industries dealing with C&D waste management and resource recovery. The results demonstrated that those who believed in market incentive approaches outweigh people that were in favour of pecuniary impost approach. Among those who favoured pecuniary imposts, almost 90% of participants agreed with the effectiveness of landfill levies in any waste management system. Other results provided a useful insight into the actual implications of the current levy scheme. It is expected that the findings in this study contribute to developing sound policies that provide a level field for all key stakeholders and to ensure that resource recovery is further encouraged."
"Are sterols useful for the identification of sources of faecal contamination in shellfish? A case study Cholestanols; Organic Matter; Sterols This work aimed to identify the major source(s) of faecal pollution impacting Salcott Creek oyster fisheries in the UK through the examination of the sterol profiles. The concentration of the major sewage biomarker, coprostanol, in water overlying the oysters varied between 0.01 Î¼g Lâˆ’1 and 1.20 Î¼g Lâˆ’1. The coprostanol/epicoprostanol ratio ranged from 1.32 (September) to 33.25 (February), suggesting that human sewage represents the key input of faecal material into the estuary. However, a correlation between the sterol profile of water above the oysters with that of water that enters from Tiptree Sewage Treatment Works (r = 0.82), and a sample from a site (Quinces Corner) observed to have a high population of Brent geese (r = 0.82), suggests that both sources contribute to the faecal pollution affecting the oysters. In identifying these key faecal inputs, sterol profiling has allowed targeted management practices to be employed to ensure that oyster quality is optimised."

"From nanoparticles to crystals: one-pot programmable biosynthesis of photothermal gold structures and their use for biomedical applications Silver Nanoparticles; Green Synthesis; Biofabrication Inspired by nature, green chemistry uses various biomolecules, such as proteins, as reducing agents to synthesize metallic nanostructures. This methodology provides an alternative route to conventional harsh synthetic processes, which include polluting chemicals. Tuning the resulting nanostructure properties, such as their size and shape, is challenging as the exact mechanism involved in their formation is still not well understood. This work reports a well-controlled method to program gold nanostructures' shape, size, and aggregation state using only one protein type, mucin, as a reduction and capping material in a one-pot bio-assisted reaction. Using mucin as a gold reduction template while varying its tertiary structure via the pH of the synthesis, we demonstrate that spherical, coral-shaped, and hexagonal gold crystals can be obtained and that the size can be tuned over three orders of magnitude. This is achieved by leveraging the protein's intrinsic reducing properties and pH-induced conformational changes. The systematic study of the reaction kinetics and growth steps developed here provides an understanding of the mechanism behind this phenomenon. We further show that the prepared gold nanostructures exhibit tunable photothermal properties that can be optimized for various hyperthermia-induced antibacterial applications."
"Impaired Placentation and Early Pregnancy Loss in Patients with MTHFR Polymorphisms and Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus Trophoblasts; Pregnancy; Natural Killer Cells Objective: To evaluate the impact of type-1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms on impaired placentation leading to early pregnancy loss. Methods: Miscarriage materials were obtained from eight pregnant women with type-1 DM without MTHFR polymorphism, eight with MTHFR polymorphisms without type-1 DM, and eight controls with neither DM nor MTHFR polymorphisms. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and Beclin-1 expression were assessed to evaluate placentation. Results: Cytoplasmic LIF, IGF-1, and Beclin-1 expression were decreased in the superficial and glandular epithelial cells of the decidua in both study groups. LIF expression was increased in interstitial trophoblasts in the MTHFR group. IGF-1 expression was decreased in the decidual cells and interstitial trophoblasts in both study groups, while the decrease in stromal cells was noted only in type-1 DM group. Beclin-1 expression was increased in interstitial and villous trophoblasts in both study groups. Conclusion: The expression of IGF-1, LIF, and Beclin-1 are altered in both the decidua and the trophoblasts in pregnancies of women with type-1 DM and MTHFR polymorphisms, compared to normal pregnancies undergoing (elective) terminations."

"‘Like pouring fuel on a fire’: Perspectives on family and domestic violence among Ethiopian women in Melbourne Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Help-Seeking In this article, we analyse how domestic violence (DV) is understood and experienced among immigrant Ethiopian women in Melbourne, as well as the different conditions that contribute to their experiences of abuse and their responses to it. To do this, we draw on 20 interviews with participants, 7 of whom experienced intimate partner violence. Demonstrating that immigrant Ethiopian women find themselves in a social context with a set of values and understandings of family and DV that differs from their own, we argue that their responses to DV shows their selective acceptance of these values and state interventions. In exploring these themes, we contribute to the discussion about minority women's voices, values and priorities in relation to violence in the migration context. Our findings also highlight the limitations of mainstream approaches to DV, illustrating the extent to which interventions are constructed through reference to western perceptions of individuality and white feminism."

"Building the Evidence for Family Violence Policy Reform: The Work of Specialist Women's Refuges in Victoria, Australia Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Help-Seeking While specialist women's refuges have been central to responses to family violence since the 1970s, their work is under-researched. Little is known outside the family violence sector about the support they provide and how it assists women and children. There have been some critiques of their work but there is limited knowledge of the constraints women's refuges face. Based on interviews and focus groups with 100 professional stakeholders and twenty-two service users, this article analyses the work of women's refuges in the Australian state of Victoria in an effort to inform policy reform. The research found that refuges' underpinning gendered analysis, focus on safety and support and advocacy to ensure women's human rights are met have much to offer further developments in responding to family violence. In doing so, the article contributes to critical debates about the operation of refuges and the need for specialist family violence services."

"‘Typical scripts’ and their silences: exploring myths about sexual violence and LGBTQ people from the perspectives of support workers Rape; Sexual Assault; Offenders Sexism, heterosexism and cissexism shape what is visible and knowable about sexual violence for LGBTQ people. While there is a plethora of research into â€˜rape mythsâ€™ as they pertain to cisgender womenâ€™s experiences of sexual violence perpetrated by cisgender men, comparatively little research examines how myths and stereotypes about sexual violence might impact LGBTQ victims/survivors. This article draws from 29 interviews with sexual assault support workers and LGBTQ community workers in Victoria and South Australia, which form part of a broader study exploring societal discourses about sexual violence for LGBTQ people. In this article, we present findings of a thematic analysis exploring the complex interplay between heterosexist and cissexist ideas about LGBTQ people (their bodies, sexual practices and relationships) as well as myths and stereotypes about sexual violence (what it looks like, what causes it and who is deserving of compassion). The article discusses workersâ€™ views on how myths and stereotypes impact on LGBTQ victims/survivorsâ€™ ability to speak about their experiences of violence and be understood and appropriately supported by others. It is argued that myths and stereotypes can often work to minimise and justify sexual violence, while also blaming LGBTQ victims/survivors for their experiences."

"Differential Regulation of Genes Involved in Root Morphogenesis and Cell Wall Modification is Associated with Salinity Tolerance in Chickpea Salt Tolerance; Sodium Proton Exchange Protein; Salinity Salinity is a major constraint for intrinsically salt sensitive grain legume chickpea. Chickpea exhibits large genetic variation amongst cultivars, which show better yields in saline conditions but still need to be improved further for sustainable crop production. Based on previous multi-location physiological screening, JG 11 (salt tolerant) and ICCV 2 (salt sensitive) were subjected to salt stress to evaluate their physiological and transcriptional responses. A total of ~480 million RNA-Seq reads were sequenced from root tissues which resulted in identification of 3,053 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to salt stress. Reproductive stage shows high number of DEGs suggesting major transcriptional reorganization in response to salt to enable tolerance. Importantly, cationic peroxidase, Aspartic ase, NRT1/PTR, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase, DREB1E and ERF genes were significantly up-regulated in tolerant genotype. In addition, we identified a suite of important genes involved in cell wall modification and root morphogenesis such as dirigent proteins, expansin and casparian strip membrane proteins that could potentially confer salt tolerance. Further, phytohormonal cross-talk between ERF and PIN-FORMED genes which modulate the root growth was observed. The gene set enrichment analysis and functional annotation of these genes suggests they may be utilised as potential candidates for improving chickpea salt tolerance."

"Numerical modelling and safety assessment for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills Landfilling is the primary source of disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) worldwide. Australians now produce about 50 million tonnes of MSW each year and 55% of which goes into the landfills directly. The stability of the MSW landfills is one of the major geotechnical tasks in landfill design and operation. The aim of this research is to develop a novel constitutive model for the MSW consisting of solid waste, landfill gas and leachate, predict the time-dependent failure probability of the MSW landfills and identify the key factors to ensure the safety of the MSW landfills. Through the activities proposed, we expect to build a strong international and national collaborations and find potential partners for a new ARC linkage project."

"Construction cost and carbon emission assessment of a highway construction—a case towards sustainable transportation Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Due to its dynamic nature in construction, benchmarking environmental emissions of road construction projects can be a daunting task. Often stakeholders will have to prioritize the economic and environmental indicators based on the project objectives. The study presents a methodological framework to compare economic and environmental impacts to benchmark sustainable transport construction projects. Through findings, the study aims to inform focus areas and key stages of infrastructure projects to benchmark sustainable performance. Process-based emission and cost estimation models are presented with an AHP based weighting factor that enables prioritization of emissions and costs based on project scopes and objectives. Using a case study, results are represented to validate the framework and methodology. Concrete and steel are identified as the main materials that contribute to total carbon emissions, while soil and gravel are responsible for the highest costs. Electricity consumption is discovered as the major fuel type contributing to carbon emissions. Concrete and dump trucks are discovered as the top two sources of emissions and costs, respectively. Scenario analyses revealed that the choice of equipment significantly affects the projectâ€™s emissions and costs. The application of sustainable materials can significantly reduce emissions and cost. The use of the case study approach results in a lack of generalizability. However, the same methodology and process can be adopted for the sustainable benchmarking of different projects. Researchers are encouraged to investigate processes to automate sustainable benchmarking of transport infrastructure construction projects. The study is one of the first attempts to compare cost and environmental impacts using a systematic methodology of transportation infrastructure construction projects."
"Accurate corruption estimation in zigbee under cross-technology interference Interference; Zigbee; Wi-Fi Cross-Technology Interference affects the operation of low-power ZigBee networks, especially under severe WiFi interference. Accurate corruption estimation is very important to improve the resilience of ZigBee transmissions. However, there are many limitations in existing approaches such as low accuracy, high overhead, and requirement of hardware modification. In this paper, we propose an accurate corruption estimation approach, AccuEst, which utilizes per-byte SINR (Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio) to detect corruption.We combine the use of pilot symbols with per-byte SINR to improve corruption detection accuracy, especially in highly noisy environments (i.e., noise and interference are at the same level). We extract pilot symbols by leveraging protocol signatures. In addition, we design an adaptive pilot instrumentation scheme to strike a good balance between accuracy and overhead.We implement AccuEst on the TinyOS 2.1.1/TelosB platform and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments. Results show that AccuEst improves corruption detection accuracy by 79.4 percent on average compared with state-of-the-art approach (i.e., CARE) in highly noisy environments. In addition, AccuEst reduces pilot overhead by 83.7 percent on average compared to the traditional pilot-based approach.We implement AccuEst in a coding-based transmission protocol, and results show that with AccuEst, the packet delivery ratio is improved by 22.1 percent on average."

"Oxidative treatment of bisphenol A by Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)/H2O2 and identification of the degradation products Ferrate Ion; Disinfection; Oxidation Bisphenol A (BPA) is classified as a xenoestrogen compound and has caused adverse effects in humans and animals. Ferrate(VI) (Fe(VI)) and the combination of Fe(VI) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were investigated to degrade BPA in water. This study evaluated the impact of BPA initial concentration (50, 200, and 1,000Î¼g Lâˆ’1) and background anions (Clâˆ’, PO43âˆ’, and NO3âˆ’) on the degradation efficiency of the combined oxidants. The results showed that Fe(VI)/H2O2 performed significantly better than Fe(VI) or H2O2 alone. BPA degradation (50Î¼g Lâˆ’1) using Fe(VI)/H2O2 was recorded at 99.8% within 60 min at pH 8.0 with [Fe(VI)]/[H2O2] molar concentration ratio of 250:2,500. At the same initial concentration of BPA and pH condition, the degradation of BPA using Fe(VI) and H2O2 was recorded as 89% ([Fe(VI)]/[BPA]=5) and 33.5% ([H2O2]=2,500Î¼g Lâˆ’1), respectively. BPA degradation using Fe(VI)/H2O2was 99.8%, 85.3%, and 43.8% for an initial concentration of 50, 200, and 1,000Î¼g Lâˆ’1, respectively. The presence of Clâˆ’ and NO3âˆ’ ions had no obvious effects on BPA degradation; however, a considerable reduction in the degradation efficiency was observed for PO43âˆ’ (350Î¼g Lâˆ’1) due to the complexation between PO43âˆ’ ion and ferric oxy/hydroxides. There were eleven intermediates detected in BPA degradation using Fe(VI)/H2O2, and three degradation pathways were proposed, including hydroxylation, cleavage of the C-C bond, and oxidation to form ring opening products. A reduction in ecotoxicity was observed after 60 min of reaction for both Fe(VI) and Fe(VI)/H2O2."

"Integrated treatment of food waste with wastewater and sewage sludge: Energy and carbon footprint analysis with economic implications Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste Food waste (FW) is a primary constituent of solid waste and its adequate management is a global challenge. Instead of disposal in landfills, integrated treatment of FW with wastewater (WW) can diminish both environmental and economic burdens. Utilizing steady-state modelling and life cycle assessment techniques, this study investigated the prospects of FW integration with biological WW treatment in terms of WW treatment performance, net energy and carbon footprint and economics of the process. The explored scenarios include co-disposal and treatment with WW by using FW disposers and anaerobic co-digestion with sewage sludge in Hong Kong. Compared to the existing WW and FW treatment, the integrated scenarios significantly improved the energy balance (~83â€“126%), net greenhouse gas emissions (~90%), and economics of operation, with permissible impact on WW treatment performance. Therefore, utilizing the surplus capacity of the existing WW treatment facilities, these integrated scenarios are a promising solution for sustainable development."

"Teaching and learning Requirements Engineering concepts: Peer-review skills vs. problem solving skills Peer Assessment; Collaborative Writing; Assignment Teaching of Software Engineering courses is challenging from many perspectives, where one of the key aspects is authentic assessment of the student work. Assessment of students' work becomes especially challenging when we are dealing with large cohorts of students. The assessment typically should be done in a very short time frame, either to provide an early feedback within the semester or to allow for finalisation of the students' grades for the course. Providing timely and comprehensive feedback is especially important during the semester, when students are more keen to improve their skills on the course topics. In this work we (1) analyse the level of correlation between students' peer-review skills and their problem solving skills within Requirements Engineering activities, and (2) to what extent the students' peer-feedback can be used to provide an early feedback within the semester or to mark students' assessments."

"Achieving the SDGs: Evaluating indicators to be used to benchmark and monitor progress towards creating healthy and sustainable cities Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians In 2016, the World Health Organization declared that â€˜Health is one of the most effective markers of any city's successful sustainable developmentâ€™ (World Health Organisation, 2016). With estimates that around 6.7 billion people will live in cities by 2050, 21st century city planning decisions will play a critical role in achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They will determine the city structure and access to health-enhancing (or health-damaging) urban environments, and ultimately lifestyle choices that impact both individual and planetary health. Benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating city planning policies and interventions is therefore critical to optimise urban outcomes. In 2017, the UN adopted a global SDG indicator framework, calling for complementary national and regional indicators to be collected by member countries. UN Habitat has also developed an indicator action framework specifically for cities. This paper examined the extent to which the UN indicators will help cities evaluate their efforts to deliver sustainability and health outcomes. It identified inconsistencies between the two UN indicator frameworks. Many of the SDG indicators assess outcomes, rather than the comprehensive and integrated â€˜upstreamâ€™ policies and interventions required to deliver outcomes on-the-ground. Conversely, the UN Habitat framework incorporates intervention indicators, but excludes health outcome indicators. A more comprehensive approach to benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating policies designed to achieve healthy and sustainable cities and assessing spatial inequities is proposed."

"Modelling ballistic cranial injury and backspatter using smoothed particle hydrodynamics Wounds And Injuries; Gunshot Wounds; Projectiles Forensic investigation has the primary challenge of assessing cause from limited evidence. The use of computational modelling can play a role in assessing potential ballistic pathways in a crime investigation by analysing; (a) the entry wound and blood spatter patterns; (b) the influence of target materials; and (c) the cranial geometry, to inform the investigation process. In particular, the retrograde ejection of blood and tissue from the entry wound following projectile impact, called â€˜backspatterâ€™, and can help inform the proximity of the shooter and potentially differentiate between suicide and homicide, while providing other important forensic information. However, the â€˜backspatterâ€™ phenomenon is not well understood due to the lack of viable surrogate models and the difficulties of analysing the high-speed, extreme-force impact. This study presents (i) the development of an anatomically based model of cranial ballistic injury using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method; (ii) the simulation of the tail splashing and temporary cavitation mechanisms and the effect of different cranial skin and cranium simulants on backspatter generation; (iii) an evaluation of anatomical geometry simulation results such as stress and strain and velocity of the particles ejected as backspatter; and (iv) a parametric study of the effect of bullet calibre and speed on the ballistic response of the anatomical geometry computational model."
"Applying a Gendered Lens to the Stay and Defend or Leave Early Approach to Bushfire Safety Wildfires; Wildland-Urban Interface; Disaster This paper provides an historical and cultural context, from a feminist perspective, of the Prepare, Stay and Defend or Leave Early (PSDLE) bushfire safety policy, colloquially known as â€˜Stay or Goâ€™, in Australia. We examine the historical, cultural, and political factors that have devalued and marginalised women's experience and knowledge of bushfire preparedness and response. The central tenet of Stay or Go is that able bodied, prepared people should remain with their houses during a fire threat, best embodied by the common maxim â€˜people save houses and houses save peopleâ€™. This approach has been routinely presented as evidence-based policy but the argument presented here challenges the evidence base for the policy by applying a feminist analysis, through the application of a â€˜gendered lensâ€™. This shows that an assumed masculine norm, at a number of different levels, has had a profound effect on the dominant readings of the available evidence about bushfire safety which has skewed bushfire safety policy and compromised the possibility of effective alternative responses. The PSDLE/Stay or Go policy is a prime example of the importance of applying critical feminist analyses to unsettle existing assumptions of policy development and implementation."

"Technology-Facilitated Sexual Violence Victimization: Results From an Online Survey of Australian Adults Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica Online forms of sexual harassment and abuse as experienced by adults represent an emerging yet under-researched set of behaviors, such that very few studies have sought to estimate the extent of the problem. This article presents the results of an online survey of 2,956 Australian adult (aged 18 to 54 years) experiences of technology-facilitated sexual violence (TFSV) victimization. The prevalence of TFSV was analyzed in relation to a 21-item scale developed in accordance with prior conceptual research identifying multiple dimensions of TFSV including digital sexual harassment, image-based sexual abuse, sexual aggression and/or coercion, and, gender and/or sexuality-based harassment (including virtual sexual violence). Results revealed significant differences in lifetime TFSV victimization for younger (18-24) and non-heterosexual identifying adults. Lifetime TFSV victimization for men and women was not significantly different, though women were more likely to report sexual harassment victimization and men were more likely to report victimization through the distribution of non-consensual images, as well as gender and/or sexuality-based harassment. The authors conclude that although women and men report experiencing similar overall prevalence of TFSV victimization, the nature and impacts of those experiences differ in particular gendered ways that reflect broader patterns in both gender relations and â€œofflineâ€ sexual harassment."

"Stigmatizing and Mitigating Elements of a TV News Report on Violent Crime and Severe Mental Illness: An Experiment Stigma; Mental Patient; Stereotyping The news media is a major contributor to stigmatizing beliefs that people with mental illness are dangerous and should be avoided. To reduce stigma, it is critical to understand how to reduce the negative impact from stories about violence and mental illness. This study experimentally manipulated elements of a TV news report to explore the effect on stigma. Participants were 838 community adults, mainly from the U.K. and USA, who were randomized to one of two versions of a TV news report describing a violent crime in which the perpetrator has a severe mental illness, one containing additional stigmatizing elements and the other elements thought to mitigate against stigma. Participants completed a variety of stigma outcome measures designed to assess beliefs about dangerousness, fear, and desire for social distance. The effect of the news condition upon stigma was mixed. While several effects were in the expected direction favoring the mitigating condition, these effects were very small and not statistically significant. In contrast, participants in the mitigating condition showed significantly lower prosocial beliefs and greater perceived difference from people with mental illness than the stigmatizing condition. Exploratory analyses suggested that country may have moderated effects. In conclusion, we could not reliably detect a difference between the two versions of the TV news report on stigmatizing outcomes. Further novel research is needed to build the evidence base of how to improve TV reporting of stories involving people with severe mental illness in the context of violent crime."

"Nutrient removal by alginate-immobilized Chlorella vulgaris: response to different wastewater matrices Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water BACKGROUND: Immobilized algae are a promising tool to treat wastewater within a short time (<12 h) and simplify biomass harvesting compared with suspended algae. The potential of alginate-entrapped Chlorella vulgaris to bioremediate secondary (with and without nutrient supplementation), primary and two lagoon municipal wastewaters was investigated. The capability of the system to adapt to these wastewaters was analysed by determining biotic and abiotic nutrient removal, and further evaluated by comparison with suspended cells. RESULTS: The algal nitrogen (N) content (4.6â€“7.8 wt%) was closely related to the wastewater ammonium concentration (R2 = 0.97). The algal cells did not adapt N uptake as effectively to wastewater nitrate concentration because both abiotic N and phosphorus (P) removal increased. The algal P content (1.2â€“3.2 wt%) varied in response to the wastewater P and was inversely related to the initial cellular P content. The algae thus adapted nutrient uptake to the wastewater N:P level and ratio when ammonium predominated. Biomass production (35â€“73 mg L-1 d-1) increased with dissolved organic and inorganic carbon with little impact from other wastewater characteristics. Immobilization did not affect N and P uptake per cell compared with suspended algae. CONCLUSION: Decoupling biotic and abiotic removal showed adaptation to the N:P of the wastewater and luxury P uptake had significant impact during treatment of different wastewater matrices, these traits were not affected by immobilization. Immobilization enables increased N and P removal rates compared with suspended algal systems as nutrient uptake per cell is not affected and higher concentrations of algal biomass within the reactor are facilitated.

"Bodies of/at Work: How Women of Colour Experienced Their Workplaces and Have Been Expected to ‘Perform’ During the COVID-19 Pandemic Intersectionality; Feminism; Social Location Almost 50 years ago, Edward Said wrote on â€˜the otherâ€™ in relation to race and gender in his path-breaking book Orientalism (1978). While much has evolved around notions of gendered and racialised otherness since then, Saidâ€™s conceptualisation still resonates today. Our paper reports on a 2020/2021 survey of Women of Colour in the Australian workplace. The survey was conducted during the pandemic by Women of Colour Australia, a not-for-profit group, working with the lead author. We focus on the qualitative answers from participants, many of which detail sometimes painful and extremely personal workplace experiences. More than 500 Women of Colour, including seven per cent who were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, completed the survey. Sixty per cent said they had experienced discrimination in the workplace, despite 59 per cent of participants saying their workplace had a Diversity and Inclusion policy. Participants had to â€˜performâ€™ their identities whilst being subjected to intersectional issues of racism and sexism, some of which the pandemic exacerbated. Our paper describes the harmful ramifications of gendered othering of Women of Colour for Australian organisations and society in the years of the pandemic."
"Smart specialisation and regional policy detailed project description The Centre of Excellence on Smart Specialisation and Regional Policy will promote international cooperation between researchers and policy makers working on initiatives to support innovative economic and social development in regions within the European Union Member States, and in other partner countries. It will broaden understandings of the role of EU Regional Policy in the integration of the European Union, recognising the evolution of policy to its current emphasis on smart specialisation strategies. The effectiveness of Regional Policy in assisting with integration, particularly since the global financial crisis, will be a key theme, along with understanding the logic of the current Policy direction. This has global relevance, as it offers an approach to addressing problems such as regional disparities, the implications of climate change and cultural cohesion that are found in all parts of the world, not least in Australia."
"Vignette question design for the assessment of graduate sustainability learning outcomes Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development The development of university wide graduate attributes has become an important mechanism for setting generic learning outcomes across higher education institutions. Many universities around the world have developed sets of graduate attributes that they aim to develop through degree programs. Sustainability related attributes have been included in numerous university attribute statements, however, little research exists on methods that can be used to capture data on the application and use of these attributes by graduates. This paper evaluates an assessment tool, based on a scenario/vignette question design, which can be used to capture data on graduate attributes in context and has the potential to be used across a large graduate population which would enable comparative research of learning outcomes to be undertaken. An evaluation of the usefulness of the scenario/vignette design will be presented based on a pilot of the question design with a sample of RMIT University graduates. The results of the pilot show that scenario/vignettes address some of the limitations of existing self-assessment methods and represent a novel way to collect data on graduate sustainability attributes post-degree completion."
"How digital natives learn and thrive in the digital age: Evidence from an emerging economy Digital Divide; Internet Use; Education As a generation of 'digital natives,' secondary students who were born from 2002 to 2010 have various approaches to acquiring digital knowledge. Digital literacy and resilience are crucial for them to navigate the digital world as much as the real world; however, these remain under-researched subjects, especially in developing countries. In Vietnam, the education system has put considerable effort into teaching students these skills to promote quality education as part of the United Nations-defined Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4). This issue has proven especially salient amid the COVID??19 pandemic lockdowns, which had obliged most schools to switch to online forms of teaching. This study, which utilizes a dataset of 1061 Vietnamese students taken from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)'s ""Digital Kids Asia Pacific (DKAP)"" project, employs Bayesian statistics to explore the relationship between the students' background and their digital abilities. Results show that economic status and parents' level of education are positively correlated with digital literacy. Students from urban schools have only a slightly higher level of digital literacy than their rural counterparts, suggesting that school location may not be a defining explanatory element in the variation of digital literacy and resilience among Vietnamese students. Students' digital literacy and, especially resilience, also have associations with their gender. Moreover, as students are digitally literate, they are more likely to be digitally resilient. Following SDG4, i.e., Quality Education, it is advisable for schools, and especially parents, to seriously invest in creating a safe, educational environment to enhance digital literacy among students."
"Simulation of indoor fine particulate dosimetry in a realistic human upper airway model based on the wildfire Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Wildland; Breathing Apparatus In this study, the indoor air quality data from experimental measurements was used to study the deposition of high levels of PM2.5 in a realistic human upper airway. Human inhalation risk assessment of particle dosimetry (in mass, number) was conducted. A 5 folds deposition dosages increase was discovered between before and after the wildfire, suggesting indoor human inhalation protection is needed. It is also recommended to reduce indoor/outdoor activities as a higher breathing flow rate could cause further deposition enhancement."
"High-Performance Aqueous Zinc-Ion Battery Based on an Al0.35Mn2.52O4 Cathode: A Design Strategy from Defect Engineering and Atomic Composition Tuning Nati2(Po4)3; Lithium Manganese Oxide; Battery Rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), which adopt mild aqueous electrolytes with high power density and safety, have received significant interest. As the most widely used cathode material for ZIBs, manganese-based oxide has poor rate performance owing to its low electronic conductivity and slow ion diffusion kinetics. In this study, using the synergistic regulation strategy of defect engineering and atomic composition tuning, a mesoporous Al0.35Mn2.52O4 with an ultrahigh surface area (up to 82 m2 gâˆ’1) is fabricated through Al substitution in the Mn3O4, followed by an Al-selective leaching process. During the entire process, numerous defects are obtained in the spinel structure by removing â‰ˆ30% of the Al cations. Al substitution can improve the material conductivity, while cation defects can weaken the electrostatic effect and promote ion diffusion ability. Therefore, the Al0.35Mn2.52O4 cathode of ZIBs exhibits a high reversible capacity of 302 mAh gâˆ’1 at a current density of 100 mA gâˆ’1. Furthermore, the reversible capacity remains at 147 mAh gâˆ’1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1500 mA gâˆ’1. This synergistic regulation of atomic composition tuning and defect engineering provides a new perspective for improving the performance of electrode materials in ZIBs."
"An investigation of indoor air quality in school classrooms in Victoria, Australia Indoor Air Pollution; Indoor Environmental Quality; Carbon Dioxide Poor thermal conditions and indoor environmental quality are known to decrease productivity and cause dissatisfaction for building occupants. Acceptable indoor air quality (IAQ), for example, is defined as air with no known contaminants at harmful concentration levels, and yet prescription of ventilation rates in standards and guidelines in educational facilities are deemed sufficient for acceptable IAQ. However, studies have shown these requirements are often not met. While the impact of indoor environmental quality on health and educational outcomes in schools have been extensively investigated, scientific studies on measurements of indoor environmental conditions in P-12 schools in Australia are limited. This paper presents the initial results of the year-long study investigating the IAQ performance before (for two school terms) and after (last two school terms) the installation of fresh filtered air ventilation systems in the selected school classrooms in Victoria, Australia. Specifically, this paper is the evaluation of the Term 1 indoor air quality conditions of ten (10) classrooms in four (4) primary schools and a secondary school prior to the intervention in the ventilation system."
"Energy poverty and obesity Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Obesity is a major health concern in both developed and developing nations. Yet, evidence on the determinants of obesity is relatively limited. We contribute to the literature on the determinants of obesity by empirically examining the effects of energy poverty on obesity. Using 14 waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, we find energy poverty is positively associated with obesity. Applying linear probability model, our estimates suggest that being energy poor results between 1.4 and 2.5 percentage points increase in the probability of being obese, depending on how energy poverty is measured. Our results are robust to alternative modelling techniques, inclusion of additional control variables and potential influence of unobservable. We also find that amount of sleep, health status and level of psychological distress are important transmission channels through which energy poverty influences the probability of being obese."

"Assessing ecosystem resilience to a tropical cyclone based on ecosystem service supply proficiency using geospatial techniques and social responses in coastal Bangladesh Cultural Ecosystem Services; China; Natural Capital Ecosystem services are essential for the livelihoods of marginalized communities; however, their supply can be severely disturbed when natural hazards impact on low-lying coastal regions. To understand potential disaster impacts on sustainable livelihoods, ecosystem resilience needs to be assessed before and after a disaster. We examined ecosystem resilience to a tropical cyclone in a southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh in terms of its impacts on the ecosystem's service supply proficiency (ESSP). We adopted a two-tiered methodology commencing with landcover mapping using object-based image analysis (OBIA) to identify five distinct landcovers (cropland, mangrove forest, riparian forest, tidal flat, and sandy beach). Then, Likert scores were used to reflect human perceptions of the supply proficiency of three types of ecosystem services (provisioning, regulating, and cultural services) associated with each landcover. The resilience of each landcover type was assessed by integrating maps of damage and recovery with the Likert scores to calculate ESSP scores. A substantial post-cyclone reduction in ESSP scores was revealed. Significant recovery (both short- and long-term) was observed in most of the affected ecosystems, albeit at somewhat different rates for different ecosystems. This study provides a multi-faceted evaluation of cyclone impacts on existing ecosystems and insight into ecosystem behaviour at different temporal phases of a disaster event. Accordingly, the study offers a novel way to study ecosystem resilience to support effective coastal planning within a vulnerable coastal community."
"Live-cell systems in real-time biomonitoring of water pollution: Practical considerations and future perspectives Genetic Procedures; Photorhabdus Luminescens; Whole Cell Continuous monitoring and early warning of potential water contamination with toxic chemicals is of paramount importance for human health and sustainable food production. During the last few decades there have been noteworthy advances in technologies for the automated sensing of physicochemical parameters of water. These do not translate well into online monitoring of chemical pollutants since most of them are either incapable of real-time detection or unable to detect impacts on biological organisms. As a result, biological early warning systems have been proposed to supplement conventional water quality test strategies. Such systems can continuously evaluate physiological parameters of suitable aquatic species and alert the user to the presence of toxicants. In this regard, single cellular organisms, such as bacteria, cyanobacteria, micro-algae and vertebrate cell lines, offer promising avenues for development of water biosensors. Historically, only a handful of systems utilising single-cell organisms have been deployed as established online water biomonitoring tools. Recent advances in recombinant microorganisms, cell immobilisation techniques, live-cell microarrays and microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip technologies open new avenues to develop miniaturised systems capable of detecting a broad range of water contaminants. In experimental settings, they have been shown as sensitive and rapid biosensors with capabilities to detect traces of contaminants. In this work, we critically review the recent advances and practical prospects of biological early warning systems based on live-cell biosensors. We demonstrate historical deployment successes, technological innovations, as well as current challenges for the broader deployment of live-cell biosensors in the monitoring of water quality."

"Community Learning Centres (CLCs) for Adult Learning and Education (ALE): development in and by communities Adult Literacy; Life Long Learning; Education Institutionalised forms of adult learning and education (ALE) such as community learning centres (CLCs) and related models are found in most parts of the world. These are spaces offering opportunities for literacy and skills training, health and citizenship, general, liberal and vocational education, in line with fuller recognition of the meaning of lifelong learning, and in the context of local communities. Often these institutions form the basis for even more informal and participatory learning, like study circles and community groups. They may share facilities like libraries and museums, clubs and sports centres, which are not within the remit of the Ministry of Education. This article reviews relevant literature and identifies recent studies and experiences with a particular focus on the Asia-Pacific and Africa regions, but also considers insights related to interventions at the global level. Findings point to low levels of participation of adults in general, and more specifically so for vulnerable and excluded groups which can hardly cross respective barriers. The authorsâ€™ discussion is guided by the question What conditions are conducive to having more and better ALE for lifelong learning â€“ and which roles can CLCs and other community-based ALE institutions play? This discussion is timely â€“ the authors argue that CLCs need to be given more attention in international commitments such as those made in the context of the International Conferences of Adult Education (CONFINTEA) and the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). CLCs, they urge, should be part of transformative discourse and recommendations at CONFINTEA VII in 2022."

"Perception of embodied carbon mitigation strategies: The case of Sri Lankan construction industry Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Whilst operational carbon (OC) emission reduction has received greater attention in the literature, embodied carbon (EC) emission reduction aspect has been largely neglected. This is particularly seen in developing countries. This study assessed the awareness and perception of carbon emission in general and EC emission reduction strategies in particular in the Sri Lankan construction industry. A detailed questionnaire, based on a comprehensive literature review, was developed to assess the awareness and perception of the Sri Lankan construction professionals about global carbon emissions, OC emissions, and EC emissions and carbon mitigation strategies. Based on a sample of 111 professionals in the construction sector, results revealed that the Sri Lankan construction professionals have poor awareness about carbon emission, especially about EC emission and EC mitigation strategies. The results further revealed that they are more concerned about the OC emission reduction than the EC emission reduction. The results suggest that they are basically aware of some basic/conventional mitigation strategies such as better design (low-carbon), an extension of building life and refurbishment of existing buildings and carbon tax, but their awareness of recently introduced micro-level technologies/strategies is significantly poor. Findings are a clear reflection of the current situation in many developing countries with regard to carbon emission and mitigation strategies. It was found that a major reason for low awareness was related to the culture: The majority of the respondents believed that actions to reduce carbon footprint should be initiated and handled by the government and other authorities, but not by construction professionals."
"A review of 3D printed patient specific immobilisation devices in radiotherapy Radiosurgery; Gamma Knife; Betatrons Background and purpose: Radiotherapy is one of the most effective cancer treatment techniques, however, delivering the optimal radiation dosage is challenging due to movements of the patient during treatment. Immobilisation devices are typically used to minimise motion. This paper reviews published research investigating the use of 3D printing (additive manufacturing) to produce patient-specific immobilisation devices, and compares these to traditional devices. Materials and methods: A systematic review was conducted across thirty-eight databases, with results limited to those published between January 2000 and January 2019. A total of eighteen papers suitably detailed the use of 3D printing to manufacture and test immobilisers, and were included in this review. This included ten journal papers, five posters, two conference papers and one thesis. Results: 61% of relevant studies featured human subjects, 22% focussed on animal subjects, 11% used phantoms, and one study utilised experimental test methods. Advantages of 3D printed immobilisers reported in literature included improved patient experience and comfort over traditional methods, as well as high levels of accuracy between immobiliser and patient, repeatable setup, and similar beam attenuation properties to thermoformed immobilisers. Disadvantages included the slow 3D printing process and the potential for inaccuracies in the digitisation of patient geometry. Conclusion: It was found that a lack of technical knowledge, combined with disparate studies with small patient samples, required further research in order to validate claims supporting the benefits of 3D printing to improve patient comfort or treatment accuracy."

"Towards zero-energy buildings in China: A systematic literature review Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation Zero-energy buildings have attracted interest worldwide as they consume less energy and can alleviate energy shortages caused by rapid economic development. This paper presents a review of the research and development regarding zero-energy buildings in China. First, it briefly introduces the evolution of the definition of zero-energy buildings and discusses the key influencing factors of such buildings in China. Then, envelope design, selection of mechanical and electrical equipment, and solar energy utilization aspects of zero-energy buildings are examined. Additionally, this paper discusses the development and application of zero-energy buildings in China, including project types, design methods, energy resources allocation, and energy operation management. Finally, this paper analyzes China's policies for zero-energy buildings, including incentive mechanisms, laws and regulations, and problems encountered, and provides suggestions for promoting zero-energy buildings in China. We expect this review to identify gaps and future directions for research and development, which will lead to new technologies, methods, policies, and standards that can be applied to zero-energy buildings."
"Nitrogen contamination and bioremediation in groundwater and the environment: A review Nitrate Pollution; Denitrification; Isotopes Nitrogen contamination of groundwater and the environment is an increasing problem in today's society. Since the invention of the Haber-Bosh process in 1913, the impacts of N on human health and the environment have become increasingly widespread due to the industrial scale production of reactive N (Nr). As a result, government organisations and the scientific community continue to make advances towards tackling this ongoing problem. The inherent difficulties of accessing, observing and monitoring groundwater, combined with the complexity of interactions between groundwater chemistry, hydrogeology and ecology have resulted in gaps in fundamental knowledge, specifically regarding the understanding and remediation of N contaminated groundwater. As these knowledge gaps are addressed with ongoing research, current and future remediation targets are being consistently updated; this has resulted in past remediation strategies that may no longer be consistent in meeting new regulatory guidelines for water quality. As such, the search for more technically and economically feasible remediation strategies continues. Recent advances in bioremediation technologies have opened up promising avenues for research in the remediation of N contaminated groundwater. This literature review outlines the past, present and future of Nr-contamination and remediation in Nr -contaminated groundwater within the broader context of the larger environment. The literature cited in this review is critically evaluated to determine significant knowledge gaps."

"W-N Bonds Precisely Boost Z-Scheme Interfacial Charge Transfer in g-C3N4/WO3Heterojunctions for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2Evolution Cyanogen; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Photocatalysts Exploring and achieving precise electron-transfer channels in the interface of Z-scheme heterojunctions are essential and have been considered as immense challenges. A strategy to precisely connect the valence band (VB) site of g-C3N4(CN) with the conduction band (CB) site of WO3through the tungsten-nitrogen (W-N) bond was developed to create a chemically bonded Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst. Because of this reason, the photogenerated electrons from the CB site of WO3could be accurately and directly injected into the VB site of CN, following the direct Z-scheme charge separation pathways. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of optimal CNWB was 482 Î¼mol h-1, 4.3 times higher than that of CN/WO3without an N-W bond (CNWU). The CNWB also shows better photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity than the previous CN/WO3systems. Theoretical and experimental results further confirm that the newly formed N-W bonds become metallic, which could act as atomic-level interfacial channels to precisely accelerate Z-scheme interfacial electron transfer and shorten the electron-transfer distance, thus substantially boosting photocatalytic H2generation. This work paves a way to design and synthesize the chemically bonded Z-scheme interface with atomic precision for interesting photocatalytic applications in the future."

"Passive fuel cell heat recovery using heat pipes to enhance metal hydride canisters hydrogen discharge rate: An experimental simulation Metal Hydrides; Hydrogen Storage; Heat Transfer This paper reports on an experimental investigation of a passive thermal coupling arrangement between a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell and a Metal Hydride (MH) hydrogen storage canister using heat pipes for enhancing the release rate of hydrogen. The performance of this arrangement was measured by inserting the evaporator sections of the heat pipes into an aluminum plate mimicking one out of five cooling plates of a 500-W fuel cell (that is a 100 W section of the stack). Thermal pads were attached on both sides of the plate to represent the fuel cell heat to be supplied to a 660-sl MH canister. The results showed that the operating temperature of the fuel cell can be maintained in the desired range of 60-80â—¦C. A complementary experimental study was also conducted on an 800-sl MH canister supplying hydrogen to a 130-W fuel cell stack (a slightly scaled-up setup compared to the first experiment). The study confirmed the findings of an earlier theoretical study by the authors that by supplying about 20% of the total cooling load of the stack to a MH canister, its maximum sustainable hydrogen supply rate increased by 70%, allowing for continuous operation of the stack at its rated power."
"The potential of new technologies to disrupt housing policy Planning; GIS; Cartography The research identified four main fields of technological advancement that are likely to disrupt the housing sector in future, or are already doing so: matching markets; big data; GIS mapping software; and blockchain. Technological change presents real opportunities for the housing sector, including more efficient allocation of housing stock, more accurate and transparent property management systems, and better informed planning and development processes. At the same time, however, the most advanced technological disruption to date in the housing spaceâ€”the matching market Airbnbâ€”highlights the ways in which responding to and regulating disruptive technologies presents new challenges for governments and is challenging for governments. Key challenges include the protection of privacy, the need to ensure transparency in increasingly complex technological systems, the cost and access risks associated with the commercialisation of significant technological systems, and the potential for disruption in one housing market to cause negative spillover effects in other parts of the housing sector. In responding to future technological disruptions, governments need more agile and critical policy making approaches to allow effective short-term responses to digital disruptions, as well as strategies for implementing longer-term cultural change and systems upgrades. The report identifies 10 key principles and strategies as a starting point for developing this new policy making â€˜playbookâ€™."
"A detailed investigation and performance optimization of a photovoltaic panel integrated with a reflecting mirror Hot Temperature; Phase Change Materials; Photovoltaic System In this paper, the performance of a photovoltaic panel integrated with a reflecting mirror is investigated. In this regard, the effects of panel and mirror tilt angles, and the mirror length on the system performance are modeled. The cell temperature rises have also been considered. Moreover, by a 3D model, the lighting and shading statuses are studied in detail, and all the possible conditions are presented and modeled. The resulting model can calculate the amount of incident solar energy on the panel and the generated electrical power in every moment during a year. This amount is dependent on the system configuration and capacity and its location. A 250-W photovoltaic panel and the city of Tehran have been considered the basics of calculations to assess the model results. By employing the genetic algorithm method, the optimum configuration has been found to have 69.084Â° and 0Â° tilt angles for the panel and the mirror, respectively, at the mirror length of 2 m. This configuration can generate 2.38 GJ (613.89 kWh) of electrical energy annually. It was also found that the optimum configuration had 0.024 GJ of annual energy losses due to the effects of cell temperature rise."
"Advancements and current challenges in the sustainable downstream processing of bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoates Poly-Beta-Hydroxybutyrate; Cupriavidus Necator; Burkholderia Sacchari Diminishing sources of synthetic plastics and their unsustainable production processes have increased the demand for alternative biodegradable and sustainable polymers. Bacterial biopolymer-producing factories can carry out large-scale production of such alternatives using improved fermentation techniques, such as fed-batch and pulsed feeding of inducers, that can increase bacterial biopolymer accumulation. However, the successive downstream processing (DSP) techniques still pose challenges in making the production process both economically and environmentally sustainable. These challenges are mostly associated with biomass pre-treatment, the use of solvents, and the embedded parameters of the DSP techniques. Conventional halogenated/chlorinated solvents can be substituted with green solvents to yield PHAs of high purity (98%) for high-end applications and to establish a sustainable circular economy. As an economically and environmentally sustainable approach, the use of recycled waste as a substrate and greener extraction solvents for bacterial biopolymer production should be further explored for the efficient replacement of synthetic plastic production."

Drawing on different proxies for female decision-making power, the authors show that awareness of, and the use of, mobile money is not sufficient to change behaviours and cultural norms. The authors argue that programs designed to encourage women to take up mobile money products will not be successful unless women actively utilise these bank accounts. The chapter provides some policy insights on how to promote empowerment using financial technologies in cash-based economies such as India."

"Social Work and the Sustainable Development Goals: A Student Placement Model Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations The United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a blueprint to address urgent global challenges, with a clear role for social workers. This paper explores a Sustainable Development Goalâ€™s focused student placement at the Australian Association of Social Workers, with RMIT University. Students reviewed the AASWâ€™s policy actions and their contribution to the SDGs, including recommendations for future work. The review identified advocacy in key areas, and the need for action on several issues, including climate action. Students learned about social work policy, practice, and sustainability. The placement itself provides a model for other organisations to align their actions to the SDGs. IMPLICATIONS There is a need for greater social work engagement with the United Nationsâ€™ SDGs to address urgent social and environmental challenges. Field education placements can provide an important opportunity for students to learn about sustainability, social work policy practice, and the SDGs. The placement model proposed in the article is suitable for any organisation that seeks to review their actions and better align their work to the SDGs."
"Public Administration, Habermas and the Crisis of Legitimacy in the Youth Justice System: An Australian Case Study Emergencies; Emergency Law; Giorgio Agamben Using an Australian case in which a liberal-democratic state systematically breached the human rights of children involved in in its youth justice system, this article explores the idea of â€˜legitimacyâ€™ and â€˜legitimation crisisâ€™ in the modern administrative state. We acknowledge the relevance of Habermasâ€™ account of a crisis of legitimacy when responding to Carl Schmittâ€™s challenge to the claim to legitimacy vested in liberal rule of law principles found in Schmittâ€™s account of state sovereignty and the power to declare exceptions. In this way we highlight some issues with how conventional public administration studies have taken the liberal framework and principles like the rule of law and equality of all before the law for granted. We argue that this field of study has paid too little attention to the role of sovereign power evident when the executive creates what Dyzenhaus and Vermeules refer to as legal â€˜black and gray holesâ€™. This highlights the value of reconsidering the concern by mainstream public administration research and theory with questions of administrative discretion and the need to pay much more attention to the role of the executive in the administration of systems like the justice system."
"The impact of state regulation in a sphere of education on sustainable development of national economy Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Education is a core element of the Sustainable Development Concept. It is not only because of the declaration of SDG 4 within the 2030 Agenda but also its embeddedness in other goals, targets, and indicators. Thus, the study aims to generalize approaches to define the relationship between the efficiency of the strategy of sustainable development of the national economy and state regulation of education. The research is accomplished for 14 Central and Eastern European countries (2006-2016) using the combination of principal components method and parametric method of stochastic frontier analysis in the software package STATA 11 and FRONTIER 4.1. As a result, the empirical proofs of the strong and adequate link between the efficiency of the sustainable development strategy of the national economy and state regulation of education are identified. The technical efficiency indexes were also calculated that allowed forming three clusters for Central and Eastern European countries distributed by the level of state regulation of education and efficiency of sustainable development strategy implementation. It helps to distinguish the main measures to reform the state regulation of education in Ukraine considering the experience of Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic, countries that proved to be the leaders in a sphere of sustainable development strategy implementation. The recommendations for further improvements in educational policies were defined. For instance, effective and sustainable state regulation of education should focus on decentralizing education, developing private-public partnerships, stimulating adult education development, etc."

"An examination of the interrelation between seaports and dry ports in developing countries: The case of Vietnam Container Port; Short Sea Shipping; Harbors (Waterways) This research aims at exploring the interrelation between seaports and dry ports in developing countries using the case of Vietnam. Apart from secondary data analysis, in-depth interviews were conducted with relevant stakeholders of the seaport-dry port system to derive insights of their interrelation patterns in the case of Vietnam. It was found that there are four patterns of seaport-dry port interrelation in the country. In the competing pattern, dry ports are developed as satellite terminals to conduct some of seaports' activities without having interrelation with seaports. In the independent pattern, dry ports are the region's load centres with no direct relationship with seaports. Thirdly, the collaborative pattern refers to the model in which seaports collaborate with specific dry ports to secure their markets. Finally, in the extended gate pattern, dry ports are developed by seaports to reach a larger and farther hinterland. Academic and managerial implications are discussed accordingly."

"High oxygen-content titanium and titanium alloys made from powder Sintering; Powder Metallurgy; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4) Oxygen remains to be a central issue in the manufacture of titanium (Ti) and its alloys from powder. The strong and short-range repulsion between interstitial oxygen and screw dislocation core strengthens titanium but compromises its resistance to cracking. It is therefore challenging to produce strong and ductile (tensile) Ti materials from high oxygen-content powder. This article reviews the tensile properties of high oxygen-content Î±-Ti, (Î±+Î²)-Ti alloys, and Î²-Ti alloys made from powder. A minimum tensile ductility value of 6% is used to define ductile Ti according to existing technical specifications for Ti-6Al-4V and other powder metallurgy materials. Two post-processing methods, solution heat treatment and thermomechanical processing, are identified to be effective remedies to convert non-ductile high oxygen-content Ti alloys into ductile ones. The underlying ductility-improvement mechanisms are discussed, which vary with alloy system. In particular, redistribution of oxygen between Î± and Î² phases by solution heat treatment offers a practical remedy to substantially improve tensile ductility, e.g., from 6% to 19% for the Ti-0.94 wt%O alloy. It is shown that appropriate post processing can enable a wide variety of Ti alloys made from powder to tolerate â‰¥0.5 wt%O for â‰¥6% tensile ductility for structural applications."

"Toxicity-removal efficiency of Brassica juncea, Chrysopogon zizanioides and Pistia stratiotes to decontaminate biomedical ash under non-chelating and chelating conditions: A pilot- scale phytoextraction study Soil Washing; Phytoaccumulation; Contaminated Soil The healthcare community acknowledged that bio-medical wastes (BMWs) have reached a colossal level across the globe. The recent pandemic (COVID-19) has brought a deluge of contaminated waste which calls for an urgent need of treatment technology for its safe disposal. BMW generally undergoes a conservative treatment approach of incineration which in turn generates potentially toxic ash known as BMW ash. BMW ash, if directly dumped in landfill, leaches and further pollutes both land and groundwater. The present study deployed Brassica juncea [Indian Mustard (IM)], Chrysopogon zizanioides [Vetiver Grass (VG)], and Pistia stratiotes [Water Lettuce (WL)] to remediate toxicity of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) i.e., Cd, Al, Pb, Cu, Mn, Co and Zn in BMW ash both in the presence and absence of chelate with an increased dosage of toxicity. The phyto-assessment results showed that IM extracted 202.2 Â± 0.1â€“365.5 Â± 0.02, 7.8 Â± 0.03â€“12.5 Â± 0.3, 132.1 Â± 0.1â€“327.3 Â± 0.1 and >100 mg kgâˆ’1 of Al, Cd, Pb and Zn, respectively without the assistance of a chelating agent. The VG accumulated heavy metals in greater concentration up to 10.5 Â± 0.1 and 290.1 Â± 0.05 mg kgâˆ’1 of Cd and Zn, respectively, and similar trends were observed in the WL set-up. However, the application of an ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) had also increased the efficiency on an average by 20â€“30% for IM, 35â€“45% for VG, and 25â€“35% for WL. The experimental set-up shows that the BCF for IM, VG and WL was found to be greater than 1 for most of the PTEs. The higher value of BCF resulted in a better ability to phytoextract the heavy metals from the soil. The results suggested that IM, VG and WL have the potential to phytoextract PTEs both in the absence and presence of chelating agents."

"Torch: A search engine for trajectory data Visual Analytics; Cluster Analysis; Pattern Mining This paper presents a new trajectory search engine called Torch for querying road network trajectory data. Torch is able to efficiently process two types of typical queries (similarity search and Boolean search), and support a wide variety of trajectory similarity functions. Additionally, we propose a new similarity function LORS in Torch to measure the similarity in a more effective and efficient manner. Indexing and search in Torch works as follows. First, each raw vehicle trajectory is transformed to a set of road segments (edges) and a set of crossings (vertices) on the road network. Then a lightweight edge and vertex index called LEVI is built. Given a query, a filtering framework over LEVI is used to dynamically prune the trajectory search space based on the similarity measure imposed. Finally, the result set (ranked or Boolean) is returned. Extensive experiments on real trajectory datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of Torch."
"Summer outdoor thermal benchmarks in Melbourne: Applications of different techniques Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Microclimate In urban planning, sustainability is often synonymous to urban livability. Urban livability seeks to improve living conditions of current and future outdoor users and hence it has become a key priority for cities authorities. Melbourne, as the world second most livable city, sets out to improve its urban life quality through various policies and initiatives. One area of improvement is the creation of sustainable outdoor spaces that provides comfortable thermal conditions for its residents. The relevant strategies to create such spaces are supported by the knowledge of human thermal comfort requirements, particularly during the summer thermal conditions. Hence, this study aims to develop comprehensive thermal comfort benchmarks for Melbourne during the summer. This study builds on 4717 subjective survey responses collected in seven urban environments with different settings. Data collection was performed in Melbourne's summer from 2012 to 2015. Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) was used to predict thermal comfort conditions. The results were based on four thermal comfort measures (neutral temperature, preferred temperature, acceptable thermal range and thermal comfort range). The analysis' outcomes suggested that Melbourne's summer acceptable thermal range is between 11.3 Â°C and 20.3 Â°C, the preferred temperature value is 21.5 Â°C, the neutral temperature value is 16.1 Â°C. Furthermore, PET index was calibrated against thermal responses collected from the surveys. The results would help to inform policies aiming to create sustainable outdoor spaces that are pleasant to outdoor users in Melbourne."

"Microfinance Institution Performance: Does the Macroeconomy Matter? Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion The performance of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) has been compared at various levels for the purpose of replications and policy formulations. However, the potential effects of the macroeconomy on MFI performance are often not considered. We propose that understanding the possible effects of country-level factors on MFI performance can help provide a more accurate evaluation and explain where microfinance fits in the development process. Based on data collected on 1544 MFIs, merged with country-level macroeconomic and macro-institutional data, we examine the effects of the macroeconomy on MFI performance. The results suggest that high economic growth is associated with better MFI performance. However, other modes of economic development, including wage employment opportunities, appear to impede MFI financial performance."

"Metabolic insights into the effects of nutrient stress on Lactobacillus plantarum B21 Viability; Bifidobacterium Animalis; Probiotic Agent Lactobacillus plantarum B21 is a strain of lactic acid bacteria first isolated from a fermentedmeat product fromVietnam. It is also a promising biopreservative with potential use in the food industry as it is a source of a novel bacteriocin (Plantacyclin B21AG) which has inhibitory effects against a wide range of species, including several pathogenic and spoilage strains. Nutrient stress is known to increase the survivability, storage stability, and bacteriocin production capability of L. plantarum B21 during industrial processing. It is however, unknown what the underlying biochemical responses that control these abilities are. This study therefore investigates the metabolite profiles of L. plantarum B21 using NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS to further understand the biochemical responses of this strain to various stress events. Unstressed cells were found to use glucose as their primary energy source with high concentrations of metabolites involved in glycolysis and organic acid synthesis, such as lactic acid, acetic acid, propanoic acid, malic acid, and 2-butenedioic acid being present in these cells. In contrast, large numbers of metabolites involved in amino acid metabolism including alanine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, valine, proline, and norleucine were upregulated in glucose stressed cells, indicating that they were using amino acids as their main source of energy. Differences in levels of fatty acids, particularly octadecenoic acid, tetracosanoic acid, and 7-hexadecenoic acid were also observed between stressed and unstressed cells. The results from this study provide insight on the biochemical response of this bacterial strain to stresses commonly found during industrial processing."

"Comparing Australian garment and childcare homeworkers’ experience of regulation and representation ILO; Personnel; Right to Strike Labour markets in Australia have long been segmented by gender and race. This study compares two highly gendered and racially segmented labour markets, home-based family day care workers and garment homeworkers. The comparative cases examine the broader trends of migration, production and consumption that reinforce gender and racial stereotypes, and discourses that underpin representations that women workers are ideally suited to such work. We theorise the gender and racialised inequalities of homework based on the literature on invisibilisation and social reproduction to explore the vulnerable position of migrant women and the consequences of having limited options, such as legal and social protections and any capacity to collectively organise. Our analysis examines the roles and responses of institutions and conceptualises the socio-political factors that affect the characterisation of homework as non-work or as self-employed entrepreneurial activities. By mapping the differing regulatory trajectories of these two groups of homeworkers in terms of regulation and representation, we find both similarities and differences. While garment homeworkers have achieved recognition through legislation and social mobilisation, their circumstances leave them less likely to access such rights. By contrast, the failure to recognise family day care homeworkers, has left them to market forces. JEL code: J01."
"Understanding the Experiences of Vietnamese Women Leaders: Advancing an Existential Philosophical and Psychological Perspective Vietnam; Intimate Partner Violence; Sexual Health The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the value(s) of existential philosophy and psychology for understanding womenâ€™s lives in a cross-cultural context. It focuses on Vietnamese women and the formation of their self-identity in the process of becoming a leader. Theoretically, we draw on the existential philosophy of Martin Heideggerâ€™s fundamental ontology that emphasizes being, temporality and context (thrownness), Simone de Beauvoirâ€™s account of gender and other pertinent existentialists. To illustrate the value of an existential perspective, we offer an empirical example of a Vietnamese womanâ€™s life-story (who was chosen because she is a leader), interpreting her self-identity as it unfolds over the life span. This approach has the potential to capture an individualsâ€™ diverse and complex modes of being, how they take part in shaping their reality through their situatedness in the world. The value of existentialism lies in its view of self-identity as a process of becoming, as opposed to a fixed and stable entity, providing the means for theorizing the possibilities for female agency, which addresses one of the limitations of the existing research on womenâ€™s leadership in Vietnam. Our analysis of the participantâ€™s life-story offers a case illustration of her encounters with the conditions of existence, which serve as important events, milestones, and turning points that promote a critical reflection on the role that culture, choice, and meaning plays in her life and leadership."
"Green technology transfer in a developing country: mainstream practitioner views Entrepreneurial University; Academic Entrepreneurship; Innovation Purpose: This paper aims to explore green technology (GT) transfer through the perceptions of both business managers and technology specialists, who have been identified as the foremost practitioners of this practice. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 22 semi-structured interviews were conducted with business leaders and technology scientists. The interviewees were asked to share their views on the motivations for importing GT; their familiarity with, knowledge of and understanding of GT transfer and the current GT performance in their organization; the key strengths of GT transfer and its limitations; the barriers to the use of GT; and their usefulness. The theoretical framework of actorsâ€™ resistance to institutional demands of Oliver (1991) is used as a theoretical lens to investigate the perceptions of the interviewees. Findings: This study suggests that despite some benefits of the adoption of GT, such as increasing competitive advantage and improving green operations, there are huge concerns over the use and importation of GT. More specifically, almost all the technicians were concerned about the technical risks resulting from the lack of operational tests, the old technologies and the lack of knowledge transfer. Meanwhile, the paucity of specific regulations, guidance and environmental standards has been reported by business managers as one of the primary constraints for this movement. Research limitations/implications: This research contributes to the emerging literature on GT transfers in the developing world. It proves that the lack of communication and the scarcity of a true champion for GT efforts have reduced the efficiency of GT transfer. Practical implications: By shedding light on the intricate nature of the relationships arising from GT adoption in organizations, this paper aims to support business leaders and standard setters in making a decision regarding the implementation and promotion of GT transfer, especially in the context of developing countries. Originality/value: To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is one of the first studies to explore eco-friendly technology transfers in a developing country from the micro-level perspective of both business and technology practitioners of GT-recipient organizations."

"Local implementation of global accounting reform: evidence from a developing country International Financial Reporting Standards; Accounting Conservatism; Firm Purpose: While the world-wide adoption of international financial reporting standards (IFRS) aims to eliminate differences in national accounting standards between countries, the socio-political institutions surrounding financial reporting practices remain localised. This paper aims to penetrate and reveal the manner in which local national context, stakeholder intentions and financial reporting practices can moderate the compliance with IFRS in a developing country. Design/methodology/approach: An interview-based qualitative research framework was used to analyse the experience and attitudes of accountants, auditors and financial reporting regulators during a passage of accounting reform initiatives. Findings: This paper provides a critical analysis of the financial reporting practices of a developing country that has ostensibly implemented accounting reforms prescribed by the World Bank. It has revealed the key firm- and field-level logics that are experienced and managed by regulators and corporate managers in their approaches to financial reporting and accountability. The World Bank-led accounting reform can be constrained by a complex mix of institutional logics originating from market and corporate structures, networks of institutionalised family and political relationships, professional and regulatory structure and resourcing limitations and cultural business conventions. This paper provides evidence of firm- and field-level logics that contest and influence the emergence of a financial reporting oversight body and lead to highly variable compliance with international accounting standards. Originality/value: This paper aims to extend our knowledge beyond broad national-level elements of institutional orders. It presents a more penetrating examination of the existence and contestation of logics originating from various local and global actors and interests. It presents a theoretical mapping of institutional logics, which operate in international and local settings and also encompass firm- and field-level imperatives. Any effort to understand and improve accounting practices of a developing country need to consider the power, contestation and influence of multiple logics operating in its institutional environment."

"Stories of employability: improving interview narratives with image-supported past-behaviour storytelling training Impression Management; Job Interview; Applicant Purpose: Stories of employability are told in employment and educational settings, notably the selection interviews. A popular training approach guiding higher education students to construct employability stories has been the past-behaviour storytelling method. However, insufficient research exists regarding the method's effectiveness and optimisation. This study examines whether the method (1) increases the quantity and quality of interview narratives in story forms and (2) can be enhanced by image stimuli. Design/methodology/approach: In a double-blind randomised control trial with repeated measures, participants submitted four weekly interview narratives. After receiving past-behaviour serious storytelling training in Week 3, they were randomly allocated to an exposure group using images and a control group using keywords as a placebo to continue producing interview narratives. The interview narratives were assessed based on the number of stories and quality ratings of narrative conformity, relevance and conciseness. Results before and after the training, and with and without the image stimuli, were analysed. Findings: Training increased the number of stories. Training and repeated practice also increased narrative quality ratings. However, the image-based intervention was the strongest predictor of improved quality ratings (effect size 2.47 points on the observed scale of 0â€“10, p < 0.01, 95% CI [1.46, 3.47]). Practical implications: A pre-existing ability to tell employability stories cannot be assumed. Training is necessary, and intervention is required for enhancement. Multi-sensory narrative interventions may be considered. Originality/value: This study is the first known double-blind randomised control trial with repeated measures evaluating if storytelling training and image stimuli improve interview narratives."

"Stabilized marine and desert sands with deep mixing of cement and sodium bentonite Soil Cement; Compressive Strength; Calcium Carbide Road construction is becoming increasingly important in marine and desert areas due to population growth and economic development. However, the load carrying capacity of pavement is of gear concern to design and geotechnical engineers because of the poor engineering properties of the soils in these areas. Therefore, stabilization of the soils is regarded as an important issue. Besides, due to the fuels combustion and carbonate decomposition, cement industry generates around 5% of global CO2 emission. Thus, using bentonite as a natural pozzolan in soil stabilization is more eco-friendly than using cement. The aim of this research is to experimentally study of the stabilized marine and desert sands using deep mixing method by ordinary Portland cement and sodium bentonite. Different partial percentages of cement along with different weight percentages of sodium bentonite were added to the sands. Unconfined compression test (UCS), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were conducted on the specimens. Moreover, a mathematical model was developed for predicting the strength of the treated soils."

"A card game designed to teach english pragmatic markers Speech Acts; Interlanguage Pragmatics; Compliment Responses In this paper, we describe the development of Mind You!, an educational card game currently in development to engage learners of English as a Second Language (ESL) to learn English pragmatic markers. Pragmatic markers, a study of pragmatics refer to individual words or phrases that provide the hearer context clues about the intended meaning of a speaker during conversation. Learners competent in the pragmatics of a foreign language can interpret intended meanings of native speakers thus developing cross-cultural understanding. Despite this, pragmatics has been given little attention in ESL classes due to lack of teacher training and suitable teaching materials. Mind You! is currently being developed as a supplement for teachers to use in ESL classes for teaching pragmatic markers. The development of Mind You! used a research through design approach which involved three case studies and three brainstorming workshops. The case studies examined how the rules, instructions and aesthetics of three existing card games engaged ESL learners in oral communication development. Thematic analysis involved determining common themes found in observations of learners playing the games and interviews with them about their learning experiences. Findings included providing equal opportunity for learners to practise the language during social interaction, card visual aesthetics containing relevant information for language learning and simple scoring system. The brainstorming workshops were conducted with game designers to conceptualise the rules, instructions and aesthetics of Mind You!. The three brainstorming workshops also informed three design iterations of the card game. Each iteration consists of rules, instructions and aesthetics designed differently for learners to practise using pragmatic markers in sentences within social interaction and language play."
"Readiness for contingency: punctuation, poise, and co-design Participatory Design; Co-Design; Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) How do we ready ourselves to intervene responsively in the contingent situations that arise in co-designing to make change? How do we attune to group dynamics and respond ethically to unpredictable developments when working with â€˜communityâ€™? This paper challenges co-design conventions that focus too tightly on formal process by addressing what happens at the moment when we step into situations to alter them with others. This is intrinsically relational and we expose the politics of practice that cannot be replicated or interchanged. Instead, we suggest that practices of readying are constituted by personal histories, experiences, philosophies, and cultures and demonstrate this by giving reflexive accounts of our dimensions of preparation. We have organised these accounts around the qualities of punctuation and poise as a way to draw out some less easily articulated aspects of co-design practice. These narratives are distinct, yet reveal complementary theories and worldviews that shape ontologies and, in turn, shape the experienceâ€“and politicsâ€“of collaboration."

"Investigation of influence of magnet thickness on performance of cusped field thruster via multi-objective design optimization Hall Thrusters; Specific Impulse; Ion The cusped field thruster (CFT) is a class of advanced electric propulsion (EP) technology for satellite and space missions, offering advantages over other types of EP including enhanced electron confinement owing to the magnetic mirror and reduced particle loss effects at the dielectric wall. The increasing demand for downscaling for micro-satellite class platforms while keeping performance at similar level has led to considerable efforts dedicated to physical modeling and performance characterization of downsized CFT. Multi-objective design optimization is conducted in this study by employing performance parameters of downscaled CFT, namely, thrust, total efficiency, and specific impulse as the objective functions to maximize and design parameters including anode voltage and current, mass flow rate, and inner and outer magnet radii as the decision variables. Two geometric configurations are considered, i.e., those comprising three magnets with fixed thickness and four magnets with variable thickness to gain insights into the influence of magnet thickness on the performance. Considerable effects of magnet thickness on the performance have been found, including thrust increase of up to approximately 20% and increase in specific impulse by up to approximately 10%, as compared to the configuration with fixed thickness magnets."

"Implications of co-contamination with aged heavy metals and total petroleum hydrocarbons on natural attenuation and ecotoxicity in Australian soils Bioremediation; Bioaugmentation; Contaminated Soil The bioremediation of historic industrial contaminated sites is a complex process. Co-contamination, often with lead which was commonly added to gasoline until 16 years ago is one of the biggest challenges affecting the clean-up of these sites. In this study, the effect of heavy metals, as co-contaminant, together with total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) is reported, in terms of remaining soil toxicity and the structure of the microbial communities. Contaminated soil samples from a relatively hot and dry climate in Western Australia were collected (n = 27). Analysis of soils showed the presence of both contaminants, TPHs and heavy metals. The Microtox test confirmed that their co-presence elevated the remaining ecotoxicity. Toxicity was correlated with the presence of lead, zinc and TPH (0.893, 0.599 and 0.488), respectively, assessed using Pearson Correlation coefficient factor. Next Generation Sequencing of soil bacterial 16S rRNA, revealed a lack of dominate genera; however, despite the variation in soil type, a few genera including Azospirillum spp. and Conexibacter were present in most soil samples (85% and 82% of all soils, respectively). Likewise, many genera of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were identified in all soil samples. Streptomyces spp. was presented in 93% of the samples with abundance between 7% and 40%. In contrast, Acinetobacter spp. was found in only one sample but was a dominant member of (45%) of the microbial community. In addition, some bacterial genera were correlated to the presence of the heavy metals, such as Geodermatophilus spp., Rhodovibrio spp. and Rubrobacter spp. which were correlated with copper, lead and zinc, respectively. This study concludes that TPH and heavy metal co-contamination significantly elevated the associated toxicity. This is an important consideration when carrying out risk assessment associated with natural attenuation. This study also improves knowledge about the dynamics of microbial communities in mixed contamination scenarios. Elevated ecotoxicity was associated with the presence of heavy metals along with TPH in soil samples. Many hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were observed with no major dominance."

"Feasibility of microalgae as feedstock for alternative fuel in Malaysia: A review Biofuel; Nannochloropsis; Chlorella Sorokiniana Biodiesel is an attractive fuel replacement for diesel engine in Malaysia. The application of biodiesel as fuel-blend has been implemented commercially in transport sector in the country. Among various potential feedstock for biodiesel production, microalgae have been appeared as a promising source since a decade due to its' high biomass productivity, rapid growth rate, large amount of lipid content, capability of high CO2 capture and sequestration as well as suitable geographical location to be harvested. The main objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of microalgae harvesting in Malaysia to produce biodiesel and potential to implement microalgae-biodiesel as commercial transportation fuel. This study demonstrated the current scenario of overall biodiesel production and application in Malaysia. Since Malaysia is the world's second-largest oil palm producer, exploitation of edible palm oil for the making of biodiesel is to be blamed as the cause of soaring food price; therefore, the country is currently looking for 3rd generation biofuel sources and microalgae has been preferred for this purpose. Therefore, insight of the significance of microalgae cultivation for this purpose, suitable microalgae candidates and possible feasibility of microalgae biodiesel have been delineated in this review study. Prospects and challenges to implement microalgae biodiesel have also been emphasized in this study. Therefore, the advantages and limitations of this biodiesel can be transparent to government and non-government sectors. Thus, this study can re-direct both sectors in future. Consequently, it may contribute setting an appropriate government policy to encourage microalgae for biodiesel production to sustain the local biofuel and secure economic growth, energy security and improve environmental conditions in near future."

"Mental Ill Health in Homeless Women: A Review Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease Research indicates that homeless women are reported to experience more mental health issues than women who are not homeless and are an increasing proportion of the overall homeless population. In addition, homeless women are more likely to have alcohol and/or other drug use disorders. We provide a comprehensive review of the contemporary literature that revealed homeless women experience a range of mental health problems including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol and other drug use disorders. Studies in this literature review indicate that some women have pre-existing mental health issues which precipitate homelessness while others develop mental illness because of their homelessness; domestic violence was also recognised as an antecedent to homelessness, although further research is needed in this area. The results of this study indicate that the homeless cohort is a complex one with distinct needs. We provide information that can help refine assessment processes and plan appropriate services to address the mental health needs of homeless women. Finally, recommendations for mental health nursing practice in regard to caring for homeless women are made."

"Binary Zn–Ti alloys for orthopedic applications: Corrosion and degradation behaviors, friction and wear performance, and cytotoxicity Magnesium Alloys; Biodegradable Implant; Corrosion Zinc (Zn) and its biocompatible and biodegradable alloys have substantial potential for use in orthopedic implants. Nevertheless, pure Zn with a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure has only two independent slip systems, therefore exhibiting extremely low elongation and yield strength in its as-cast condition, which restricts its clinical applications. In this study, as-cast Znâ€“xTi (titanium) (x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30 wt.%) binary alloys were hot-rolled and their microstructures, mechanical properties, wear resistance, and cytocompatibility were comprehensively investigated for orthopedic implant applications. The microstructures of both as-cast and hot-rolled Znâ€“xTi alloys consisted of an Î±-Zn matrix phase and a TiZn16 phase, while Znâ€“0.2Ti and Znâ€“0.3Ti exhibited a finer Î±-Zn phase due to the grain-refining effect of Ti. The hot-rolled Znâ€“0.2Ti alloy exhibited the highest yield strength (144.5 MPa), ultimate strength (218.7 MPa), and elongation (54.2%) among all the Znâ€“xTi alloys. The corrosion resistance of Znâ€“xTi alloys in Hanksâ€™ solution decreased with increasing addition of Ti, and the hot-rolled Znâ€“0.3Ti alloy exhibited the highest corrosion rates of 432 Î¼m/y as measured by electrochemical testing and 57.9 Î¼m/y as measured by immersion testing. The as-cast Znâ€“xTi alloys showed lower wear losses than their hot-rolled counterparts. The extracts of hot-rolled Znâ€“xTi alloys at concentrations of â‰¤ 25% showed no cytotoxicity to MG-63 osteosarcoma cells and the extracts of Znâ€“xTi alloys exhibited enhanced cytocompatibility with increasing Ti content."

"Development and psychometric testing of the AASPIRE Adult Autism Healthcare Provider Self-Efficacy Scale Autistic Disorder; Autism; Lay Beliefs Our objective was to develop a measure of healthcare providersâ€™ self-efficacy in providing healthcare to autistic adults and to better understand their training needs. We used a community-based participatory research approach with academic researchers, autistic adults, supporters, and healthcare providers. We developed a one-page questionnaire which included the new 6-item self-efficacy scale, two items on how challenging and rewarding it is to provide care to autistic adults, and seven items on provider characteristics. We surveyed 143 healthcare providers from eight primary care clinics in Oregon and California, United States. Preliminary psychometric testing found the Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education (AASPIRE) Adult Autism Healthcare Provider Self-Efficacy Scale to have good internal consistency reliability (Cronbachâ€™s alpha 0.87) and consist of a single factor. A priori hypothesis testing found correlations in the expected directions. Only a minority of providers reported high confidence in communicating with patients (25%); performing physical exams or procedures (43%); accurately diagnosing and treating other medical issues (40%); helping patients stay calm and comfortable during visits (38%); identifying accommodation needs (14%); and making necessary accommodations (16%). While providers need training across all aspects of care related to autism in adulthood, interventions should pay particular attention to helping providers communicate with patients and identify and make accommodations. Lay abstract: The adult healthcare system is ill-prepared to provide high-quality care to autistic adults. Lack of provider training may contribute to the problem, but there are few previously tested survey instruments to guide provider training efforts. Our objective was to develop and test a measure of healthcare providersâ€™ confidence (or â€œself-efficacyâ€) in providing healthcare to autistic adults and to use it to better understand their training needs. We used a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, in partnership with academic researchers, autistic adults, supporters, and healthcare providers, throughout the project. We developed a one-page questionnaire and surveyed 143 primary care providers from eight primary care clinics in Oregon and California, United States. Preliminary testing of the AASPIRE Adult Autism Healthcare Provider Self-Efficacy Scale suggests that the measure is reliable and valid. Using this scale, we found only a minority of providers reported high confidence in communicating with patients (25%); performing physical exams or procedures (43%); accurately diagnosing and treating other medical issues (40%); helping patients stay calm and comfortable during visits (38%); identifying accommodation needs (14%); and making necessary accommodations (16%). While providers need training across all aspects of care related to autism in adulthood, interventions should pay particular attention to helping providers communicate with patients, and identify and make necessary accommodations. Future research is needed to further validate this scale and to understand how to meet providersâ€™ training needs most effectively."
"Critical determinants for mobile commerce adoption in Vietnamese SMEs: A preliminary study E-Commerce Adoption; Top Management Support; Electronic Commerce The critical determinants for e-commerce, e-business, and other enterprise information systems adoption in SMEs have been well-documented. The critical determinants for m-commerce adoption in SMEs, however, are still limited, especially in SMEs in developing countries. This paper develops a measurement instrument for investigating the critical determinants of m-commerce adoption in Vietnamese SMEs. A preliminary study is conducted for confirming the reliability and validity of the instrument based on the data collected from 172 managers of Vietnamese SMEs using an online survey. The Cronbachâ€™s alpha and the composite reliability values of the proposed variables strongly support their reliability. The results of the exploratory factor analysis confirm constructsâ€™ discriminant validity. The average variance extracted values confirm constructsâ€™ convergent validity. This study contributes to the identification of the critical determinants for m-commerce adoption in SMEs. It provides a new conceptual framework for assessing the critical determinants for m-commerce adoption in SMEs in developing countries."
"Opening the black box of the sport event volunteer’s journey: from candidate to volunteer Sports; Corporate Citizenship; Sports Events Research question: This paper investigates candidatesâ€™ journey to being selected as a volunteer for the Rio2016 Games. Drawing on Actorâ€“Network Theory, the research tracked the sociomaterial practices undertaken by candidates to become volunteers and sought to identify the actors that participate in these practices and the role the latter played in facilitating a positive (or negative) experience. Research method: A postmodern ethnography provided the basis to critically analyse candidatesâ€™ experiences in applying for a volunteer role at the Games. Data were collected via internet sites, email communications, a volunteer Facebook page, interviews with volunteers (N = 17) and official Rio 2016 documents. Results and Findings: The journey to volunteering at Rio 2016 comprised sociomaterial practices that impacted the volunteer candidateâ€™s progression (or lack thereof) through the journey to volunteering. These were qualifying as a candidate, Waiting for â€˜Godotâ€™, Being rejected and Getting the â€˜passportâ€™ to the Games. Implications: This research presents a practice-based conceptualisation of volunteer candidatesâ€™ journey to selection. The findings demonstrate the centrality of sociomaterial practices in volunteer recruitment and the importance of an effective human and non-human interface. Flexible approaches to volunteer recruitment and selection that consider the diversity of interactions of actors involved can be profitably deployed to facilitate a good candidate experience and minimise the stress, tension and communication issues that potential volunteers face."

"Carbon dioxide reforming of methane over mesoporous alumina supported Ni(Co), Ni(Rh) bimetallic, and Ni(CORh) trimetallic catalysts: Role of nanoalloying in improving the stability and nature of coking Catalyst; Steam Reforming; Synthesis Gas Catalytic dry reforming of methane using carbon dioxide (DRM) to produce CO rich syngas (synthesis gas) over supported nickel catalysts presents major challenges including the carbon deposition and active metal sintering at high operating temperatures. In this work, we have demonstrated that addition of rhodium and cobalt to the nickel phase supported on mesoporous alumina (MAl) to form bimetallic and tri metallic RhNi/MAl, NiCo/MAl, and NiCoRh/MAl catalysts and alloying of Ni was found to enhance the catalyst activity and high resistance toward coking. All these catalysts were synthesized using a triblock copolymer P123 templated precipitation of aluminum isopropoxide and metal precursors, followed by the removal of the template by calcination. The high conversions of CH4 with CO2 into syngas and the nature of carbon formation on these bimetallic catalysts were found to be different from those of the monometallic catalysts, and the ratios of H2 and CO in the syngas were observed to be 0.9âˆ’1. The enhanced stability and activity were attributed to the bimetallic phase formation, which was supported by XRD, XPS, TPR, TGA, TEM, and N2-sorption analysis of the fresh and spent catalysts. From these results, a plausible mechanism was proposed to explain the enhanced catalytic activity and stability, which was mainly due to the nature of alloy formation. Nickel was found to form a homogeneous alloy phase with cobalt, while it formed a heterogeneous bimetallic phase with rhodium. Alloying with cobalt moderates the coking in the NiCo/MAl case, while alloying with rhodium increases the carbon gasification by hydrogen spillover effect in the case of NiRh/MAl."
"Alginate-immobilised algal wastewater treatment enhanced by species selection Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Immobilisation of algae by entrapment in alginate beads enables rapid nitrogen and phosphorus removal from wastewater and simplifies biomass harvesting for resource recovery. The alginate beads provide a protected environment for algal cultivation, enabling a species to be selected with less risk of contamination occurring during wastewater treatment. Immobilised Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus abundans, Selenastrum capricornutum and Coelastrum microporum were compared in terms of the nutrient uptake capacity of each bead with the aim of selecting the species with highest uptake and so reducing the operational cost of bead generation. The N:P ratio assimilated from the wastewater varied markedly between species and was not affected by cultivation in N-depleted or P-depleted medium before immobilisation. This indicated species could be selected based on the relative importance of N or P removal for the site, or tailored to the wastewater, with C. vulgaris (cellular N:P of 6.1 Â± 0.2) and S. abundans (2.6 Â± 0.1) best suited for wastewater with a high and low N:P ratio, respectively. S. abundans adapted best to the restricted growth environment of the alginate matrix, assimilated the most P per cell (reducing interference of wastewater PO43âˆ’ with the Ca-alginate structure), and thus led to the most durable beads during semi-continuous treatment of wastewater. This species gave the longest treatment duration of 42 days and algal cell production of 1.36 Â± 0.7 Ã— 107 cells/bead. S. abundans also achieved the greatest nutrient removal capacity (101 Â± 8 Î¼g N/bead and 45.9 Â± 1.9 Î¼g P/bead), demonstrating that the cost of alginate bead supply per unit of nutrient removed could be reduced and potential resource recovery from the biomass increased."

"Impacts of farmers' adaptation to drought and salinity intrusion on rice yield in Vietnam's Mekong Delta Crops; CERES (Experiment); Climate Change Impact Purpose: The Vietnamese Mekong River Delta (VMD) is one of the most affected deltas by climate change in the world. Several studies have investigated factors influencing farmers' climate change adaptation behaviors in the region; however, little is known about the effectiveness of such measures. This paper examines the determinants of adaptation strategies among VMD rice farmers and assesses the impacts of such practices on rice yield. Design/methodology/approach: Endogenous switching regressions were employed using a survey data of 300 rice-producing households in An Giang and Tra Vinh provinces in 2016. Findings: The results show that farmers receiving early disaster warnings are more likely to adopt adaptation measures to climate change. If nonadaptors had chosen to respond, their rice yield would have increased by 0.932 tons/ha/season. Research limitations/implications: The data sample is small and collected from two provinces in the VMD only; therefore, the results may be specific for the study sites. However, future research can adopt the proposed method for other regions. Originality/value: The study estimates the production impacts of farmers' decisions on whether or not to adapt to extreme climate events. The proposed approach allows for capturing both observed and unobserved behaviors."

"People-centered disaster recovery: A comparison of long-term outcomes of housing reconstruction in Thailand, India, and Japan Temporary Housing; Disaster; Tsunamis Although scholars recognize the importance of long-term recovery outcomes for disaster risk reduction and community empowerment, even within the limited research on long-term housing recovery, cross-national and temporal comparisons of multiple reconstruction projects are rare. Drawing on a systematic literature review and case-study approach, this paper explores two case studies of post-disaster housing reconstruction projects, each from three countries in Asiaâ€“ India, Thailand, and Japan. The cases are post-disaster housing reconstruction after the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake and 2008 Kosi River floods in Bihar in India, the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and 2014 Chiang Rai Earthquake in Thailand, and the 1995 Great Hanshin Awaji (Kobe) Earthquake and 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan. Comparisons across cases found consistency as well as change in each country. Analysis of reconstruction policies, programs, and governance systems led to several key findings, identifying housing reconstruction processes that led to beneficial longer-term outcomes in social, economic, technical and environmental aspects in the three countries. In contrast to government-driven housing recovery programs in Japan, housing recovery programs in both India and Thailand included crucial support from Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) integrated with and complementing official support from the government. Able to translate government policies into practice in ways that community needs could be met in increasingly people-centered ways, CSOs played significant roles in the provision of needed housing units and beyond, in facilitating increased flexibility of housing recovery options, filling gaps as an intermediary between the government and the needs of the people."

"Scientometric review of construction demolition waste management: a global sustainability perspective Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management The increase in construction projects with rising construction demolition waste (CDW) challenges is alarming, and it poses a significant threat to sustainable urban development. The challenge of CDW management (CDWM) is noteworthy with varied consequences on social, economic, environmental, and physical development perspectives. Although there has been research from different perspectives on CDWM for over 40 years, there is a limited scientometric review research in these areas to date. This study, therefore, conducts a global scientometric analysis of CDWM articles to understand its sustainable development research approach for further studies. Article titles, keywords, and abstract search methods were used to extract related articles from the year 2000 to 2021. A total of 4374 articles retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection were analysed using CiteSpace software for scientometric analysis. The result revealed active research on CDWM from influential researchers, research institutes, institutions, reputable journals, and countries. The policy recommendations and frameworks adopted in the past have focused more on reducing, recycling and reuse (3R), and they adopt these strategies and others as single strategies for improving CDWM. These strategies are limited in integrating sustainable development strategies such as the circular economy and bio-dynamic. This study concludes that there is a need for a comprehensive research approach that incorporates the economic, social, and physical implications of CDWM to maximise the value of CDW for sustainable development. It presents a comprehensive scientometric analysis of the CDWM, adds to the existing knowledge of CDWM sustainability approach, and provides insights for future research direction relevant for the academics, professionals, and government agencies in CDWM projects."
"Challenge accepted: Women claiming leadership in higher education learning and teaching Psychological Practice; School Improvement; Professional Learning A recognised challenge for women in higher education learning and teaching is of rightfully claiming leadership. Higher education processes for recruitment, promotion, awards, grants and fellowship are founded on an ability to document and convincingly present oneâ€™s leadership contribution. The focus is on evidencing from a traditional, formal positional role view of leadership. However, the leadership contribution of women to learning and teaching often accords with a more distributed leadership approach. This may lead to women, unguided in how to evidence their leadership contribution and impact, being unable to self-acknowledge and claim their leadership contribution. The challenge for women is in claiming their leadership contribution and impact so as not to be disadvantaged in academic career progression and recognition. Drawing on a database of 15 years of research into a distributed leadership in learning and teaching, a Linguistics Inquiry approach is employed to explore reflections of female academics to their leadership contributions in learning and teaching. This reveals evidence-based strategies that have successfully supported a positive transition, by women, to self-acknowledge their leadership contributions. Many of these are resource intensive and difficult to sustain in the current higher education sector context of diminishing and reduced resources. To present a low-resource alternative, the six tenets of a Distributed Leadership approach structure a low-resource framework alternative that provides key conceptual prompts for presenting a leadership case. Vignettes of applying the framework in practice are provided to illustrate its transferability across a range of scenarios for women to rightfully claim their leadership contribution."

"The design and synthesis of fluorescent coumarin derivatives and their study for Cu2+ sensing with an application for aqueous soil extracts Fluorescence; Rhodamines; Cupric Ion A series of fluorescent coumarin derivatives 2a-e were systematically designed, synthesized and studied for their Cu2+ sensing performance in aqueous media. The sensitivities and selectivities of the on-to-off fluorescent Cu2+ sensing signal were in direct correlation with the relative arrangements of the heteroatoms within the coordinating moieties of these coumarins. Probes 2b and 2d exhibited Cu2+ concentration dependent and selective fluorescence quenching, with linear ranges of 0-80 Î¼M and 0-10 Î¼M, and limits of detection of 0.14 Î¼M and 0.38 Î¼M, respectively. Structural changes of 2b upon Cu2+ coordination were followed by fluorescence titration, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), mass spectrometry, and single crystal X-ray diffraction on the isolated Cu2+-coumarin complex. The results revealed a 1:1 stoichiometry between 2b and Cu2+, and that the essential structural features for Cu2+-selective coordination are the coumarin C=O and a three-bond distance between the amide NH and heterocyclic N. Probe 2b was also used to determine copper (II) levels in aqueous soil extracts, with recovery rates over 80% when compared to the standard soil analysis method: inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)."

"Investigating the potential of International Landcare Landcare, a grassroots community-led approach to sustainable land management, began in Australia in 1986. The model has evolved within the Australian community to a fully fledged national program that has enjoyed bipartisan support from Government. The passionate interests of individuals within the Australian Landcare movement has resulted in an informal and ad hoc spread of the Landcare approach globally. 
This project will undertake a study of the Landcare approach across six countries and determine how sustainable agricultural land management mobilised through Landcare contributes to development outcomes,including ACIAR?s high level objectives of food security and poverty reduction; better management of natural resources and climate; gender equity and empowerment of women and girls; as well as post-disaster management and recovery, and social cohesion."
"Child labour and social exclusion A trade-theoretic analysis Child Labor; Family Characteristic; School Attendance A four-good, four-factor general equilibrium trade-theoretic model is utilised that incorporates social exclusion, consumption disaggregation and child labour. In this framework, trickle-down economics fails and under very plausible conditions, socially excluded families and their children are impoverished by capital accumulation. Policies such as a ban on child labour have differential effects on the economy. Specifically, a ban on child labour in the traded goods sector necessarily improves the welfare of the socially excluded families and their children. However, a ban on child labour in the non-traded goods sector has ambiguous implications for the welfare of the excluded group. Thus, this paper highlights the importance of disaggregation and social exclusion for policymaking."

Sentiment and stock market connectedness: Evidence from the U.S. – China trade war Investor Sentiment; Exchange Traded Funds; Stock Market We assess the impact of monthly and daily investor sentiment on stock market return and volatility connectedness during the U.S.-China trade war period. Our analyses focus on the connectedness between the two economies and their major trading partners. We also investigate the asymmetric impact of sentiment on volatility connectedness by exploring the upside and downside markets separately. We consistently document a negative relationship between investor sentiment and stock market connectedness for both return and volatility. We further confirm that investor sentiment exerts a larger impact on volatility connectedness in the downside market compared to the upside market.

"Numerical assessment of respiratory airway exposure risks to diesel exhaust particles Aerosol; Dry Powder Inhalers; Particle Transport Exposure to ambient air pollution presents great adverse health risks to respiratory health, and assessing the respiratory exposure doses, especially in the human deep lung regions, remains difficult due to the sheer complexity of the process. To bridge this gap, an extended large-to-small conducting lung airway model was adopted in this study, which includes a broad scope containing bronchial airways up to the 15th generation. Accumulation mode particles in the size range of 100 nm to 3.0 Î¼m representing major size spectrum of coarse diesel exhaust were released at the inlet of respiratory airway model, and both airflow and particle deposition characteristics were numerically investigated. The simulation results showed that the particle deposition in the respiratory airway is sensitive to the variation of inhalation flow rates. For inhalation exposure at lower breathing rate of 18 L/min, both deposited diffusive and inertia particles were very unevenly distributed in the lower respiratory airway. For inhalation exposure at higher breathing rate of 50 L/min, deposited diffusive and inertia particles were both scattered over the lower respiratory airway. In addition, high inhalation flow rate enabled inertia particles to be deposited further d ownstream of the airway with deposition hot spots observed in distal airways."

To inform future interventions, policy, and research, this scoping review examined existing literature to identify factors that affect disclosure of lived experience by MHPs to colleagues and supervisors. Methods: A systematic search was conducted of four online databases, gray literature, and the reference lists of included articles. Primary research studies of any design conductedwith MHPs with lived experience of emotional distress and their colleagues were included. The findings of included studies were inductively coded within the themes of enabling, constraining, and intrapersonal factors influencing disclosure. Results: A total of 23 studies were included in data extraction and synthesis. Factors that influenced MHPs' sharing of their lived experience in the workplace were categorized into five overarching themes: The ""impaired professional,"" the ""us and them"" divide, the ""wounded healer,"" belief in the continuum of emotional distress, and negotiating hybrid identities. MHPs with lived experience described feeling conflict between professional and service user identities that affected the integration and use of their clinical and experiential knowledge. Enabling factors reflected best-practice human resource management, such as organizational leadership, access to supervision and training, inclusive recruitment practices, and the provision of reasonable accommodations. Conclusions: Findings of this scoping review suggest that organizational interventions to support MHPs in order to share their lived experience may improve workplace diversity and well-being, with implications for service users' experience."

"Operational supply risk mitigation of SME and its impact on operational performance: A social capital perspective Disruption; Supply Chain Disruptions; Dual Sourcing Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how buyerâ€“supplier social capital may help mitigate operational supply risk (OSR) of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It empirically examines a framework that posits the direct and mediated impacts of three dimensions of buyerâ€“supplier social capital â€“ structural, relational and cognitive â€“ and supplier integration on the OSR of SMEs and consequently their operational performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses data collected via a questionnaire from 485 manufacturing SMEs in Bangladesh for analysis using structural equation modeling. Findings: The analysis reveals that all the three dimensions of buyerâ€“supplier social capital can effectively reduce the OSR of SMEs, either directly or indirectly through supplier integration. The mediating role of supplier integration in the relationship between social capital and OSR is confirmed and the negative impact of OSR on operational performances of SMEs is verified. Research limitations/implications: Generalization of the findings needs to be prudent since the study gathered information only from manufacturing SMEs in Bangladesh on the buyer side of the buyerâ€“supplier dyad. Practical implications: Findings of this study can provide references for SME practitioners to formulate their OSR mitigation strategies for enhancing operational performance. Originality/value: This study adds to the currently scarce literature on OSR of SMEs by combining antecedents and consequences of OSR in a single framework. It also extends the use of buyerâ€“supplier social capital to risk mitigation research."
"‘Relatable’ as the Epitome of Praise?: Sonya Hartnett Transforms Readers Multiliteracies; Literacy Practices; Education Abstract: At a university in Melbourne, Australia, first-year preservice teachers were surveyed about their reading behaviours and attitudes. Many declared their dislike and disengagement from reading while simultaneously expressing the importance of successful reading for their future students. For these preservice teachers, the most important factor in their enjoyment was identified as being able to relate to what they were reading. If the texts were not immediately relatable then there was little incentive to keep reading. Their teacher-educators are passionate readers who believe that deep, nuanced reading is a prerequisite of reading pleasure and that reading fosters empathy and broadens human experience. It is incumbent on these teacher-educators to provide opportunities for preservice teachers to experience the effects of insightful reading on their literary and human understandings so that this, in turn, might inform and inspire similar classroom encounters for their young readers. Close readings of selected works by an award-winning Australian writer for young people demonstrate how such readings can be facilitated."

"Biofabricating complex synthetic skin structures (PhD candidate: Emily Liu s3862245) Skin is the largest organ of the human body, and is responsible for several functions vital to human survival, such as barrier protection, homeostatic modulation, and sensory function. Understanding skin’s response to external stimuli (including disease, and topically applied drugs and chemicals) is a perennial question across clinical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields. Historically animal models have been used for most of this testing, but this usage has declined in recent years owing to ethical concerns and the introduction of ‘3R’ (Replace, Reduce, Refine) legislation across most of the globe in the early 2000s. In vitro skin models have emerged as a more sustainable, humane and human-relevant alternative to animal testing. Whilst there are number of commercially available synthetic skin models, these models have not obtained the complex anatomical and physiological features (such as layering and vasculature) found in native human skin. If more complex synthetic skin could be created in the lab, it would have a breadth of applications including disease modelling, as well as testing for the toxicity and corrosivity of chemicals, transdermal drug delivery and cosmetic product testing."
"Development of a live vaccine for gut health in poultry The project aims to develop a live vaccine against necrotic enteritis, a disease of poultry estimated to cost the global poultry industry $5-6 billion USD/annum. It builds on our published work that has demonstrated the efficacy of an experimental vaccine. The proven antigen, NetB, will be expressed in live delivery vehicles, including the apicomplexan parasite Eimeria and several bacteria strains particularly suited to use in chickens. Comparative analysis of the different vaccine vehicles will allow evaluation of the relative advantages and disadvantage of the different vehicles for delivery of heterologous vaccine antigens, thus informing the choice of appropriate vectors for this and other vaccine applications."

"Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 354 Diseases and Injuries for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2017: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 National Burden; Territories; Disease Background: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) includes a comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. Methods: We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68 781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. Findings: Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3Â·9% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3Â·1-4Â·6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7Â·2% (6Â·0-8Â·4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421-723) to 853 million (642-1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7Â·9% (6Â·6-9Â·2) for males and 6Â·5% (5Â·4-7Â·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95% UI 2782-3252] per 100 000 in males vs 1400 [1279-1524] per 100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082-3583] vs 2336 [2154-2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943-3630] vs 5643 [5057-6302]). Interpretation: Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury."
"Managing bullying in the workplace: a model of servant leadership, employee resilience and proactive personality Mobbing; Incivility; Nurses Purpose: This paper develops and tests a model for managing workplace bullying by integrating employee perceived servant leadership, resilience and proactive personality. Specifically, this paper explores servant leadership as an inhibitive factor for workplace bullying, both directly and indirectly in the presence of employee resilience as a mediator. It further explores whether proactive personality moderates the indirect relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This is an empirical study based on analysis of survey data collected from 408 employees working in services and manufacturing sector organisations in Pakistan. Structural equation modelling was used to test the research model. Findings: Structural equation modelling results support the proposition that servant leadership helps in discouraging workplace bullying, both directly and indirectly, in the presence of employee resilience as a mediator. However, employee proactive personality moderates this process, such that the association between resilience and workplace bullying is stronger for individuals with high proactive personality. Research limitations/implications: This study's findings illuminate the strong potential of servant leadership for managing workplace bullying. This potential is attributed to positive role modelling in the workplace, which may assist in building followers' resilience. This study provides evidence to support the importance of leadership in the process by which employees develop better psychological resources to combat bullying at work. Originality/value: This is the first study that examines the direct relationship between servant leadership and bullying at work. In addition, this study introduced the mediating effect of resilience and the moderating effect of proactive personality on this relationship."
"Entrepreneurial Finance: Insights from English Language Training Market in Vietnam Financial Management; Venture Capital; Private Equity Entrepreneurship plays an indispensable role in the economic development and poverty reduction of emerging economies like Vietnam. The rapid development of technologies during the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) has a significant impact on business in every field, especially in the innovation-focused area of entrepreneurship. However, the topic of entrepreneurial activities with technology applications in Vietnam is under-researched. In addition, the body of literature regarding entrepreneurial finance tends to focus on advanced economies, while mostly neglecting the contextual differences in developing nations. Therefore, this research contributes to these topics by investigating the main characteristics of a high potential market for entrepreneurs in Vietnam, which is the English language training market (ELTM). It also aims at indicating the impacts of technology on the entrepreneurial firms within this market, with an emphasis on financing sources. To answer the research questions, this study employs a qualitative analysis and conducts 12 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs and researchers in the field. The key findings in our study highlight the main contributing factors to the growth of the market, both universally and context-specific for a developing nation like Vietnam. It also lists the leaders in each market segment and the industryâ€™s potential profit margin. The results also show that most entrepreneurs in the ELTM utilized private sources of finance rather than external ones, such as bank loans. It again confirms the idea from previous works that even with the rapid development of the economic and technological landscape, entrepreneurial activities in general barely benefit from additional sources of funding. However, it also points out the distinct characteristics of the ELTM that may influence these financing issues; for example, English training services usually collect revenues from customers before delivering their classes. This is of advantage for entrepreneurs in this area and helps significantly reduce the financial barriers. These findings, which are among the first attempts to contribute to a better understanding of entrepreneurial opportunities in the Industry 4.0 in Vietnam, provide valuable insights for policymakers and entrepreneurs, as well as investors."
"Strike ballots, democracy, and law ILO; Personnel; Right to Strike The purpose of the research upon which this book is based was empirically to investigate whether the ballot requirements in the Fair Work Act do indeed impose a significant obstacle to the taking of industrial action, and whether those provisions are indeed impelled by a legitimate â€˜democratic imperativeâ€™. The book starts from the proposition that virtually all national legal systems, and international law, recognise the right to strike as a fundamental human right. It acknowledges, however, that in no case is this recognition without qualification. Amongst the most common qualifications is a requirement that to be lawful strike action must first be approved by a ballot of workers concerned. Often, these requirements are said to be necessary to protect the democratic rights of the workers concerned: this is the so-called â€˜democratic imperativeâ€™. In order to evaluate the true purpose and effect of ballot requirements the book draws upon the detailed empirical study of the operation of the Australian legislative provisions noted above; a comparative analysis of law and practice in a broad range of countries, with special reference to Canada, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States; and the jurisprudence of the supervisory bodies of the International Labour Organisation. It finds that in many instances ballot requirements - especially those relating to quorum - are more concerned with curtailing strike activity than with constructively responding to the democratic imperative. Frequently, they also proceed from a distorted perception of what â€˜democracyâ€™ could and should entail in an industrial context. Paradoxically, the study also finds that in some contexts ballot requirements can provide additional bargaining leverage for unions. Overall, however, the study confirms our hypothesis that the principal purpose of ballot requirements - especially in Australia and the United Kingdom - is to curtail strike activity rather than to vindicate the democratic imperative, other than on the basis of a highly attenuated reading of that term. We believe that the end-result constitutes an important study of the practical operation of a complex set of legal rules, and one which exposes the dichotomy between the ostensible and real objectives underpinning the adoption of those rules. It also furnishes a worked example of multi-methods empirical, comparative and doctrinal legal research in law, which we hope will inspire similar approaches to other areas of labour law."

"Gender relations and social media: a grounded theory inquiry of young Vietnamese women’s self-presentations on Facebook Vietnam; Intimate Partner Violence; Sexual Health Since the introduction of Äá»•i Má»›i (market economic reforms) in 1986, Vietnam has experienced rapid social, cultural, economic and technological changes. The purpose of this study is to explore the nexus between gender relations and social media with a focus on how young urban Vietnamese women present themselves on Facebook. Grounded theory was employed to inquire into this phenomenon, revealing that the participants use various self-presentation techniques (strategies) including an ideal appearance, competency (mastery) and a positive image. The participantsâ€™ self-presentations were found to be simultaneously influenced by Confucian ethics, socialist ideology and neoliberal global culture. The intersection of these social forces has changed the nature of gender relations and expectations for young Vietnamese women, leading to the emergence of a neoliberal gendered self in their presentations on Facebook. This study foregrounds how gender relations in early twenty-first century Vietnam are being reconfigured by competing values and how these can be analyzed through and influenced by social media use."

"Toward sustainable environmental quality: Identifying priority research questions for Latin America PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs The Global Horizon Scanning Project (GHSP) is an innovative initiative that aims to identify important global environmental quality research needs. Here we report 20 key research questions from Latin America (LA). Members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) LA and other scientists from LA were asked to submit research questions that would represent priority needs to address in the region. One hundred questions were received, then partitioned among categories, examined, and some rearranged during a workshop in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Twenty priority research questions were subsequently identified. These research questions included developing, improving, and harmonizing across LA countries methods for 1) identifying contaminants and degradation products in complex matrices (including biota); 2) advancing prediction of contaminant risks and effects in ecosystems, addressing lab-to-field extrapolation challenges, and understanding complexities of multiple stressors (including chemicals and climate change); and 3) improving management and regulatory tools toward achieving sustainable development. Whereas environmental contaminants frequently identified in these key questions were pesticides, pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors or modulators, plastics, and nanomaterials, commonly identified environmental challenges were related to agriculture, urban effluents, solid wastes, pulp and paper mills, and natural extraction activities. Several interesting research topics included assessing and preventing pollution impacts on conservation protected areas, integrating environment and health assessments, and developing strategies for identification, substitution, and design of less hazardous chemicals (e.g., green chemistry). Finally, a recurrent research need included developing an understanding of differential sensitivity of regional species and ecosystems to environmental contaminants and other stressors. Addressing these critical questions will support development of long-term strategic research efforts to advance more sustainable environmental quality and protect public health and the environment in LA.

"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in inland aquatic ecosystems: Perils and remedies through biosensors and bioremediation Benzo(A)Pyrene; Immunoassay; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most ubiquitous environmental pollutants of high global concern. PAHs belong to a diverse family of hydrocarbons with over one hundred compounds known, each containing at least two aromatic rings in their structure. Due to hydrophobic nature, PAHs tend to accumulate in the aquatic sediments, leading to bioaccumulation and elevated concentrations over time. In addition to their well-manifested mutagenic and carcinogenic effects in humans, they pose severe detrimental effects to aquatic life. The high eco-toxicity of PAHs has attracted a number of reviews, each dealing specifically with individual aspects of this global pollutant. However, efficient management of PAHs warrants a holistic approach that combines a thorough understanding of their physico-chemical properties, modes of environmental distribution and bioaccumulation, efficient detection, and bioremediation strategies. Currently, there is a lack of a comprehensive study that amalgamates all these aspects together. The current review, for the first time, overcomes this constraint, through providing a high level comprehensive understanding of the complexities faced during PAH management, while also recommending future directions through potentially viable solutions. Importantly, effective management of PAHs strongly relies upon reliable detection tools, which are currently non-existent, or at the very best inefficient, and therefore have a strong prospect of future development. Notably, the currently available biosensor technologies for PAH monitoring have not so far been compiled together, and therefore a significant focus of this article is on biosensor technologies that are critical for timely detection and efficient management of PAHs. This review is focussed on inland aquatic ecosystems with an emphasis on fish biodiversity, as fish remains a major source of food and livelihood for a large proportion of the global population. This thought provoking study is likely to instigate new collaborative approaches for protecting aquatic biodiversity from PAHs-induced eco-toxicity. The current review proposes a holistic approach comprised of cross-disciplinary technologies for efficient management of PAHs in inland aquatic ecosystems through reviewing the biosensor technologies for PAH monitoring for the first time, and correlating those with bioremediation strategies."
"Board gender diversity and corporate carbon commitment: Does industry matter? Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence The study examines whether board gender diversity is associated with corporate carbon commitment, and if so, whether the association varies between firms operating in the extractive and non-extractive industries. Based on insights drawn from gender socialization, resource dependence, and critical mass theories, we develop models that link board gender diversity with corporate carbon commitment. Analyzing data obtained from Standard and Poor's 1500 firms, for the period 2015 to 2019, we find that higher representation of women on a firm's board is positively associated with the firm's carbon commitment and that the association is stronger for firms in the extractive industries. Furthermore, a nominal appointment of women to a firm's board reduces the likelihood of the firm's carbon commitment being at a given or higher level, while the appointment of a â€œcritical massâ€ of women to the board increases the firm's inclination toward higher carbon commitment. Our findings suggest that regulatory and policymaking agencies could exploit legislative and policy initiatives that would promote board gender diversity to encourage corporates, especially those operating in the extractive industries, to commit to the climate change cause."

"Measuring progress from 1990 to 2017 and projecting attainment to 2030 of the health-related Sustainable Development Goals for 195 countries and territories: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 Global Burden of Disease; Disability-Adjusted Life Year; Disability Weights Background: Efforts to establish the 2015 baseline and monitor early implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) highlight both great potential for and threats to improving health by 2030. To fully deliver on the SDG aim of â€œleaving no one behindâ€, it is increasingly important to examine the health-related SDGs beyond national-level estimates. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017), we measured progress on 41 of 52 health-related SDG indicators and estimated the health-related SDG index for 195 countries and territories for the period 1990â€“2017, projected indicators to 2030, and analysed global attainment. Methods: We measured progress on 41 health-related SDG indicators from 1990 to 2017, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2016 (new indicators were health worker density, sexual violence by non-intimate partners, population census status, and prevalence of physical and sexual violence [reported separately]). We also improved the measurement of several previously reported indicators. We constructed national-level estimates and, for a subset of health-related SDGs, examined indicator-level differences by sex and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintile. We also did subnational assessments of performance for selected countries. To construct the health-related SDG index, we transformed the value for each indicator on a scale of 0â€“100, with 0 as the 2Â·5th percentile and 100 as the 97Â·5th percentile of 1000 draws calculated from 1990 to 2030, and took the geometric mean of the scaled indicators by target. To generate projections through 2030, we used a forecasting framework that drew estimates from the broader GBD study and used weighted averages of indicator-specific and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2017 to inform future estimates. We assessed attainment of indicators with defined targets in two ways: first, using mean values projected for 2030, and then using the probability of attainment in 2030 calculated from 1000 draws. We also did a global attainment analysis of the feasibility of attaining SDG targets on the basis of past trends. Using 2015 global averages of indicators with defined SDG targets, we calculated the global annualised rates of change required from 2015 to 2030 to meet these targets, and then identified in what percentiles the required global annualised rates of change fell in the distribution of country-level rates of change from 1990 to 2015. We took the mean of these global percentile values across indicators and applied the past rate of change at this mean global percentile to all health-related SDG indicators, irrespective of target definition, to estimate the equivalent 2030 global average value and percentage change from 2015 to 2030 for each indicator. Findings: The global median health-related SDG index in 2017 was 59Â·4 (IQR 35Â·4â€“67Â·3), ranging from a low of 11Â·6 (95% uncertainty interval 9Â·6â€“14Â·0) to a high of 84Â·9 (83Â·1â€“86Â·7). SDG index values in countries assessed at the subnational level varied substantially, particularly in China and India, although scores in Japan and the UK were more homogeneous. Indicators also varied by SDI quintile and sex, with males having worse outcomes than females for non-communicable disease (NCD) mortality, alcohol use, and smoking, among others. Most countries were projected to have a higher health-related SDG index in 2030 than in 2017, while country-level probabilities of attainment by 2030 varied widely by indicator. Under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria indicators had the most countries with at least 95% probability of target attainment. Other indicators, including NCD mortality and suicide mortality, had no countries projected to meet corresponding SDG targets on the basis of projected mean values for 2030 but showed some probability of attainment by 2030. For some indicators, including child malnutrition, several infectious diseases, and most violence measures, the annualised rates of change required to meet SDG targets far exceeded the pace of progress achieved by any country in the recent past. We found that applying the mean global annualised rate of change to indicators without defined targets would equate to about 19% and 22% reductions in global smoking and alcohol consumption, respectively; a 47% decline in adolescent birth rates; and a more than 85% increase in health worker density per 1000 population by 2030. Interpretation: The GBD study offers a unique, robust platform for monitoring the health-related SDGs across demographic and geographic dimensions. Our findings underscore the importance of increased collection and analysis of disaggregated data and highlight where more deliberate design or targeting of interventions could accelerate progress in attaining the SDGs. Current projections show that many health-related SDG indicators, NCDs, NCD-related risks, and violence-related indicators will require a concerted shift away from what might have driven past gainsâ€”curative interventions in the case of NCDsâ€”towards multisectoral, prevention-oriented policy action and investments to achieve SDG aims. Notably, several targets, if they are to be met by 2030, demand a pace of progress that no country has achieved in the recent past. The future is fundamentally uncertain, and no model can fully predict what breakthroughs or events might alter the course of the SDGs. What is clear is that our actionsâ€”or inactionâ€”today will ultimately dictate how close the world, collectively, can get to leaving no one behind by 2030. Funding: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation."
"Government reform, regulatory change and carbon disclosure: Evidence from Australia Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative This paper examines the effect of two Australian environmental regulatory changes, specifically the Clean Energy Act (CEA) 2011 and the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) Act 2007 with reference to voluntary corporate carbon disclosure practices. In doing so, it describes the brief history of this carbon-related regulatory change, its scope, enforcement criteria and corporationsâ€™ disclosures. This is a longitudinal analysis of 219 annual reports of 73 listed corporations in Australia which were subjected to carbon tax and report carbon emissions as per the CEA 2011 and NGER Act 2007 accordingly. Any corporation or facility that emitted scope 1 emissions of 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) or more were liable for a carbon tax in accordance with CEA 2011. Drawing on stakeholder theory and legitimacy theory, this study uses content analysis to examine corporate carbon disclosure. The findings suggest there is a considerable increase in the number of carbon-related disclosures following these regulations being enacted as law. In addition, carbon-specific communication has become much more prevalent and accounts for a larger proportion of the sampled organisationsâ€™ reported environmental information. The results of this study enrich the validity of the hypothesis that organisations would seek to legitimise their operations to stakeholders by increasing their environment-related declarations. The evidence presented in the analysis confirms the assertion that government environmental legislation/regulation has a positive impact on corporate behaviour and accountability. These findings have significant consequences for the government, decision-makers and the accounting profession, indicating that regulatory guidance enhances both mandatory and voluntary disclosure. It also offers key insights into the possible impacts of the carbon regulatory change for future research to consider."

RMIT believes improving the consistency and quality of professional practice of teachers, across pedagogy, curriculum, assessment and reporting, is central to improving literacy and numeracy outcomes for all students. RMIT is well placed to achieve this RFQ in professional learning for teachers -personalised learning of students. 

RMIT will bring best practice design, research-evidence and project management based upon a professional learning cycle that mirrors individual, personalised learning - that is: diagnosis; prioritising and co-design of goal setting; explicit teaching; and review, feedback and monitoring. Using this evidence- based model will allow practical demonstration within a professional learning context of the strategies and theories of personalised learning."

"Safe Habitats: Does the Association Between Neighborhood Crime and Walking Differ by Neighborhood Disadvantage? Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Interrelationships between neighborhood walkability, area disadvantage, and crime may contribute to the inconsistent associations between crime and walking. We examined associations between crime and walking, and tested for differences by neighborhood disadvantage while addressing these additional complexities. Participants (n = 6,680) from 200 neighborhoods spanning the most and least disadvantaged in Brisbane, Australia, completed a questionnaire and objective measures were generated for the individual-level 1,000-m neighborhood. Multilevel models examined associations between crime (perceived and objective) and walking (recreational and transport), and interactions tested for differences by neighborhood disadvantage. High perceived crime was associated with reduced odds of transport walking, whereas high objective crime was associated with increased odds of transport walking. Patterns did not differ by neighborhood disadvantage. In disadvantaged neighborhoods, the â€œnegativeâ€ criminogenic attributes were insufficient to outweigh the â€œpositiveâ€ walkability attributes, producing similar walking patterns to advantaged neighborhoods where residents were dislocated from local destinations but buffered from crime."

"Studying potential PKCδloss of function mutation and its downstream effects in gastric cancer progression Cancer; Protein Kinase C; Phorbol Esters PKC isozymes are involved in the modulation of cellular pathways related with tumor progression, acting as a suppressor or promoter. In cancer cells, PKCs are mutated, and most common type is loss of function. This paper focuses on the effect of PKCÎ´mutation in gastric cancer. LOF mutation occurs throughout catalytic and kinase domains of PKCÎ´, disrupting activation and function of kinase. In catalytic domain, there are various potential mutation targets, such as binding groove and zinc finger. Mutation residues detected in the kinase domain, such as DFG and APE motifs, can alter catalytic function, causing interruption of activation. Also, a critical region, called hinge region, modulates caspase-3 dependent cleavage, and such tyrosine mutation in this region reduces cleavage activity, inhibiting fully activation of kinase. Importantly, LOF mutation affects cellular activity of downstream protein, p53, through inhibiting transcription, localization, and phosphorylation. For instance, C1 domain mutant suppresses binding capacity with p53, reducing transcription of p53. Disruption of cellular component, tight junction, assembling related to PKC mutation. As identified, PKCÎ´correlates with ZO-1, and LOF mutation prevent translocation of ZO-1 to TJ area, leading to errors in TJ assembling, promoting tumor invasion."
"A satellite data driven approach to monitoring and reporting fire disturbance and recovery across boreal and temperate forests Landsat; Land Cover; Remote Sensing The regular and consistent measurements provided by Earth observation satellites can support the monitoring and reporting of forest indicators. Although substantial scientific literature espouses the capabilities of satellites in this area, the techniques are under-utilised in national reporting, where there is a preference for aggregating ad hoc data. In this paper, we posit that satellite information, while perhaps of low accuracy at single time steps or across small areas, can produce trends and patterns which are, in fact, more meaningful at regional and national scales. This is primarily due to data consistency over time and space. To investigate this, we use MODIS and Landsat data to explore trends associated with fire disturbance and recovery across boreal and temperate forests worldwide. Our results found that 181 million ha (9 %) of the study area (2 billion ha of forests) was burned between 2001 and 2018, as detected by MODIS satellites. World Wildlife Fund biomes were used for a detailed analysis across several countries. A significant increasing trend in area burned was observed in Mediterranean forests in Chile (8.9 % yrâˆ’1), while a significant decreasing trend was found in temperate mixed forests in China (-2.2 % yrâˆ’1). To explore trends and patterns in fire severity and forest recovery, we used Google Earth Engine to efficiently sample thousands of Landsat images from 1991 onwards. Fire severity, as measured by the change in the normalized burn ratio (NBR), was found to be generally stable over time; however, a slight increasing trend was observed in the Russian taiga. Our analysis of spectral recovery following wildfire indicated that it was largely dependent on location, with some biomes (particularly in the USA) showing signs that spectral recovery rates have shortened over time. This study demonstrates how satellite data and cloud-computing can be harnessed to establish baselines and reveal trends and patterns, and improve monitoring and reporting of forest indicators at national and global scales."
"Experimental performance evaluation of humidification-dehumidification system with direct-contact dehumidifier Solar Still; Humidifiers; Desalination Humidification-dehumidification (HDH) desalination with direct contact dehumidifier system is designed and fabricated. Experimental tests are performed under various operating conditions in order to explore the influence of temperatures and mass flow rates of seawater and freshwater on system performance by utilizing non-dimensional parameters. It is shown that, for any case, there is an optimum flow rate ratio of water to air, which results in a maximum water production rate. A mathematical model is utilized to evaluate the system performance and compare the outcomes with the experimental results. In addition, the effect of feed water salinity from 0-30% on the water production rate is experimentally investigated. The results showed that the maximum achieved recovery ratio of the proposed HDH system is 5% under the working condition of seawater temperature at 73 Â°C with 3% salinity and cold freshwater at 28 Â°C. Furthermore, the system was able to produce water at nearly saturated seawater feed."

"A multicriteria analysis approach for evaluating the performance of agriculture decision support systems for sustainable agribusiness Farmers Knowledge; Decision Support Systems; Decision Making Agriculture decision support systems (DSSs) play an important role in facilitating evidenceâ€based agricultural decisionâ€making for improving agribusiness productivity. Evaluating and selecting the most appropriate agriculture DSS for sustainable agribusiness is, however, challenging due to the existence of production and marketing alternatives, a variety of objective functions from economic to lifestyle to longâ€term sustainability, and the subjectiveness and imprecision involved in the evaluation process. To help decision makers effectively deal with these issues, this paper presents a multicriteria analysis approach for evaluating and selecting the most appropriate agriculture DSS for sustainable agribusiness. The subjective assessments of decision makers in the evaluation process are formulated using linguistic variables approximated by fuzzy numbers. The concept based on the positive and the negative ideal solutions is applied for producing a performance index value for every agriculture DSS alternative across all evaluation criteria based on which the most appropriate agriculture DSS is. An empirical study is presented for demonstrating the stepâ€wise process for evaluating and selecting the most appropriate agriculture DSS for sustainable agribusiness. The outcome from the performance evaluation process allows agribusinesses to effectively adopt appropriate agriculture DSSs for achieving competitive advantages."

"Consequences of information suppression in ecological and conservation sciences Advocacy; Conservation Science; Scientists Suppressing expert knowledge can hide environmentally damaging practices and policies from public scrutiny. We surveyed ecologists and conservation scientists from universities, government, and industry across Australia to understand the prevalence and consequences of suppressing science communication. Government (34%) and industry (30%) respondents reported higher rates of undue interference by employers than did university respondents (5%). Internal communications (29%) and media (28%) were curtailed most, followed by journal articles (11%), and presentations (12%). When university and industry researchers avoided public commentary, this was mainly for fear of media misrepresentation, while government employees were most often constrained by senior management and workplace policy. One third of respondents reported personal suffering related to suppression, including job losses and deteriorating mental health. Substantial reforms are needed, including to codes of practice, and governance of environmental assessments and research, so that scientific advice can be reported openly, in a timely manner and free from interference."

"Cycling behaviour in 17 countries across 6 continents: levels of cycling, who cycles, for what purpose, and how far? Bicycling; Bike; Cyclist International comparisons of cycling behaviour have typically been limited to high-income countries and often limited to the prevalence of cycling, with lack of discussions on demographic and trip characteristics. We used a combination of city, regional, and national travel surveys from 17 countries across the six continents, ranging from years 2009 through 2019. We present a descriptive analysis of cycling behaviour including level of cycling, trip purpose and distance, and user demographics, at the city-level for 35 major cities (>1 million population) and in urbanised areas nationwide for 11 countries. The Netherlands, Japan and Germany are among the highest cycling countries and their cities among the highest cycling cities. In cities and countries with high cycling levels, cycling rates tend to be more equal between work and non-work trips, whereas in geographies with low cycling levels, cycling to work is higher than cycling for other trips. In terms of cycling distance, patterns in high- and low-cycling geographies are more similar. We found a strong positive association between the level of cycling and womenâ€™s representation among cyclists. In almost all geographies with cycling mode share greater than 7% women made as many cycle trips as men, and sometimes even greater. The share of cycling trips by women is much lower in geographies with cycling mode shares less than 7%. Among the geographies with higher levels of cycling, children (<16 years) are often overrepresented. Older adults (>60 years) remain underrepresented in all geographies but have relatively better representation where levels of cycling are high. In low-cycling settings, females are underrepresented across all the age groups, and more so when older than 16 years. With increasing level of cycling, representation of females improves across all the age groups, and most significantly among children and older adults. Clustering the cities and countries into homogeneous cycling typologies reveals that high cycling levels always coincide with high representation of females and good representations of all age groups. In low-cycling settings, it is the reverse. We recommend that evaluations of cycling policies include usage by gender and age groups as benchmarks in addition to overall use. To achieve representation across different age and gender groups, making neighbourhoods cycling friendly and developing safer routes to school, should be equally high on the agenda as cycling corridors that often cater to commuting traffic."

"Gender Equality Prior to and Following Separation: Nordic and Liberal Policy Inconsistencies One Child Policy; Family Planning Policy; Dual-Earner We compare family policy in Australia and Finland, focusing on child support as interrogating how gender equality ideals and realities play out when families diverge from the dual-parent model. Despite Finland's de-gendered leave and employment policy, a gender wage gap continues to position mothers as primary carers. In Australia, pre-separation policies are gendered in that leave benefits position mothers as primary carers. In both countries, child support policy took the opposite approach. Finland's child support policy provides less incentive for the father to take care of children post-separation."
"Selection of industrial trade waste resource recovery technologies-A systematic review Distillation; Direct Contact; Membrane Industrial wastewater and other trade wastes are often sources of pollution which can cause environmental damage. However, resource recovery approaches have the potential to lead to positive environmental outcomes, profits, and new sources of finite commodities. Information on these waste sources, and the valuable components which may be contained in such waste is increasingly being made available by public, academic and commercial stakeholders (including companies active in meat processing, dairy, brewing, textile and other sectors). Utilising academic and industry literature, this review evaluates several methods of resource recovery (e.g., bioreactors, membrane technologies, and traditional chemical processes) and their advantages and disadvantages in a trade waste setting. This review lays the groundwork for classification of waste and resource recovery technologies, in order to inform process choices, which may lead to wider commercial application of these technologies. Although each waste source and recovery process is unique, membrane bioreactors show promise for a wide range of resource recovery applications. Despite interest, uptake of resource recovery technologies remains low, or not widely championed. For this to change, knowledge needs to increase in several key areas including: availabilities and classification of trade wastes, technology choice processes, and industrial viability."

"Pathway, classification and removal efficiency of microplastics in wastewater treatment plants Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Microplastics (MPs) contamination in water environment has recently been documented as an emerging environmental threat due to their negative impact on the ecosystem. Their sources are many, but all of them are from synthetic materials. The sources of MPs are cosmetics and personal care products, breakdown or abrasion processes of other plastic products, textile and tyre, bitumen and road marking paints. Because of their low density and small particle size, they are easily discharged into the wastewater drainage systems. Therefore, the municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are indicated to be the main recipients of MPs before getting discharged into the natural waterbodies. Therefore, understanding the occurrence and fate of MPs in WWTPs are of great importance towards its control. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive review to better understand the pathways of MPs before entering the WWTPs, characteristics of MPs in wastewater, and the removal efficiency of MPs of the existing wastewater treatment technologies adopted by the WWTPs. This review also covers the development of potential microplastics treatment technologies investigated to date. Based on the review of existing literature, it is found that the existing WWTPs are inefficient to completely remove the MPs and there is a risk that they may get discharged into the ambient water sources."

"A review of 3D printed patient specific immobilisation devices in radiotherapy Radiosurgery; Gamma Knife; Betatrons Background and purpose: Radiotherapy is one of the most effective cancer treatment techniques, however, delivering the optimal radiation dosage is challenging due to movements of the patient during treatment. Immobilisation devices are typically used to minimise motion. This paper reviews published research investigating the use of 3D printing (additive manufacturing) to produce patient-specific immobilisation devices, and compares these to traditional devices. Materials and methods: A systematic review was conducted across thirty-eight databases, with results limited to those published between January 2000 and January 2019. A total of eighteen papers suitably detailed the use of 3D printing to manufacture and test immobilisers, and were included in this review. This included ten journal papers, five posters, two conference papers and one thesis. Results: 61% of relevant studies featured human subjects, 22% focussed on animal subjects, 11% used phantoms, and one study utilised experimental test methods. Advantages of 3D printed immobilisers reported in literature included improved patient experience and comfort over traditional methods, as well as high levels of accuracy between immobiliser and patient, repeatable setup, and similar beam attenuation properties to thermoformed immobilisers. Disadvantages included the slow 3D printing process and the potential for inaccuracies in the digitisation of patient geometry. Conclusion: It was found that a lack of technical knowledge, combined with disparate studies with small patient samples, required further research in order to validate claims supporting the benefits of 3D printing to improve patient comfort or treatment accuracy."
"Dissolution reaction kinetics and mass transfer during aqueous choline chloride pre-treatment of oak wood Biomass; Delignification; Ethanol Production Lignocellulosic biomass processing employing ionic liquids is of recent research interest for the biorefinery industry. The data on biomass dissolution kinetics in ionic liquids is important for designing scale-up pre-treatment reactor design. In this study, the reaction mechanism and kinetics of oak wood dissolution in aqueous choline chloride was investigated. In an extended effort, a correlation of dimensionless numbers was developed for the estimation the mass transfer coefficient. The analyses suggested that oak wood dissolution in choline chloride occurred in two stages. The diffusion of ionic liquid through the product layer was the dominating rate-controlling step in the first stage of dissolution followed by the surface chemical reaction in the second stage. The diffusivity of choline chloride into the oak wood matrix was ranging between 2.96Eâˆ’14 and 2.84Eâˆ’13 m2/s. The activation energy of the diffusion controlled stage and surface chemical reaction controlled stage was approximately 24.2 and 40.3 kJ molâˆ’1, respectively. The proposed mathematical correlation for mass transfer coefficient fitted well with the experimental mass transfer coefficient values."
"Enabling repair and regeneration after neonatal stroke. Neurodevelopmental disorders program ? focus on a regenerative therapy for neonatal stroke More than 1 in 4000 children suffer a stroke soon after birth. Neonatal stroke is challenging to identify clinically, meaning there is often a long delay to diagnosis, and cerebral palsy (CP)-like outcomes are not uncommon. In a model of neonatal stroke well suited to screen therapies, we will use a novel hydrogel specifically engineered to release molecules and growth factors in a controlled, time-dependent fashion that supports brain regeneration, to test if established neonatal brain injury can be repaired. This biocompatible hydrogel has proven regenerative effects in adult pre-clinical models of focal brain injury. Here, we will establish the combination of treatment molecules that maximises repair and regeneration of the damaged neonatal brain after stroke. There are currently no effective treatments for neonatal stroke, and our hydrogel approach has clear potential to translate to use in the clinic to address this urgent need.
Project Aims:
We will test a novel molecular hydrogel therapy to promote repair of the damaged neonatal brain. We have developed a bioengineered peptide hydrogel `functionalised? by the addition of fucoidan - a powerful anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory polysaccharide seaweed extract ? which is capable of the release of molecules and growth factors in a time-dependent manner to antagonise the well-characterised sequence of cellular changes that lead to neuronal and white matter damage. We have developed a neonatal rat model of focal ischaemic stroke using non-invasive photoembolism, which is ideal for testing this hydrogel therapy as it produces a clearly defined and highly reproducible ischaemic infarct."
"Top economics universities and research institutions in Vietnam: evidence from the SSHPA dataset Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science Economic research is vital for creating more suitable policies to facilitate economic growth. Employing a combination of descriptive and Bayesian analyses, this paper investigates the research landscape of the economics discipline in Vietnam, in particular, the leading affiliations in the field and how these institutions compare to each other in terms of productivity, the number of lead authors, new authors and publications' journal impact factor. We also examine the differences in the authors' productivity based on their age and gender. The dataset extracted from the SSHPA database includes 1,444 articles. The findings show that among top producers of economic research in Vietnam, seven are universities, leaving only one representative of research institutes. These top producers account for 52% of research output among 178 institutes recorded in the database. We also find a correlation between a researcher's affiliation, sex, and scientific productivity in Vietnam's economic discipline. Overall, publications by male researchers outnumber those by female ones in most of the top affiliations. The findings also indicate that 40â€“44 is the age group with the highest scientific productivity. Researchers' collaboration, which is observed through co-authorship, is on the rise in all of the top eight economic research affiliations. However, the quality of current Vietnam's scientific works in the discipline is questionable. Therefore, it is suggested that in order to sustain scientific productivity, economic researchers might need to balance the quantity and quality of their contributions.Scientific collaboration; scientific publishing; economics discipline; Vietnam; Bayesian analysis."
"""Job seeker"" experiences of punitive activation in Job Services Australia Employment Service; Activation; Welfare Reform The Job Services Australia era (2009â€“2015) was a distinct stage in the evolution of Australiaâ€™s employment services because it was then that ""work-first"" payment by results contracts, in combination with demanding ""work-first"" activation, resulted in ""punitive activation"". Experiences of this shift were collected in interviews with a small cohort of job seekers about incidents involving threat of sanction. These incidents involving threat of sanction were construed as moments where job seekers were directly exposed to the coercive authority of activation workers deployed to meet ""work-first"" targets. The findings show that ""work-first"" marketisation incentives combined with demanding ""work-first"" activation led to an experience of ""punitive activation""."
"Multipurpose metal-organic framework for the adsorption of acetylene: ethylene purification and carbon dioxide removal Metal-Organic Frameworks; Schläfli Symbol; Coordination Polymer The separation of acetylene, ethylene, and carbon dioxide is a great challenge in view of their similar sizes and physical properties. Recently, adsorptive separations using porous metal-organic frameworks have risen to prominence. Here, we report a novel microporous metal-organic framework, termed MUF-17, that selectively adsorbs acetylene in the presence of ethylene or carbon dioxide. MUF-17 possesses one-dimensional zig-zag pores that are lined with amino and carboxylate groups, and coordinated water molecules. This pore surface is highly polar and has appropriate dimensions to interact optimally with guest acetylene molecules. Dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations confirm the strong interactions between the framework and acetylene and illustrate the electrostatic basis for its lower affinity for other gases. The application of MUF-17 to gas separations was demonstrated by dynamic breakthrough measurements. It is a multipurpose adsorbent, removing trace quantities of acetylene from ethylene and sequestering bulk quantities in the presence of carbon dioxide. Its excellent performance fruitfully couples high selectivity with uptake capacity. Advantageously, MUF-17 is straightforward, robust, and inexpensive to prepare. Its recyclability and high stability render it a high-performance material for sustainable and energy-efficient separation processes."
"Producing fit-for-purpose water and recovering resources from various sources: An overview Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production Natural resources, except wind power and solar energy, are depleting, and therefore it is essential to develop and implement best management practices wherever possible. With respect to water, integrated water management is essential to preserve the fresh water for many generations to come. Producing fit-for-purpose water from various sources such as rainwater, wastewater, seawater/brackish water, and stormwater will contribute greatly to conserve the fresh water. By looking at a few wastewater streams, such as domestic wastewater and wastewaters from industries such as textile, aquaculture, mining, meat processing, carwash, and agriculture, generated all over the world informs us that quantifying them and characterizing their qualities are important to understand many aspects. The increase or decrease in consumption and technologies implemented (or need to be implemented) for water and energy savings, recovery of energy and resources from concentrates and other wastes (such as wastewater sludge, agricultural and food wastes) to reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover materials and energy will give clear direction that should be taken in research and development and implementation of technologies for sustainable living."

"Blockchain-Based Access Control for Secure Smart Industry Management Systems Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things Smart manufacturing systems involve a large number of interconnected devices resulting in massive data generation. Cloud computing technology has recently gained increasing attention in smart manufacturing systems for facilitating cost-effective service provisioning and massive data management. In a cloud-based manufacturing system, ensuring authorized access to the data is crucial. A cloud platform is operated under a single authority. Hence, a cloud platform is prone to a single point of failure and vulnerable to adversaries. An internal or external adversary can easily modify usersâ€™ access to allow unauthorized users to access the data. This paper proposes a role-based access control to prevent modification attacks by leveraging blockchain and smart contracts in a cloud-based smart manufacturing system. The role-based access control is developed to determine usersâ€™ roles and rights in smart contracts. The smart contracts are then deployed to the private blockchain network. We evaluate our solution by utilizing Ethereum private blockchain network to deploy the smart contract. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and evaluation of the proposed frameworkâ€™s performance."

"Rapid Assessment of the Impact of COVID-19 on Wet Market Reforms: Case Studies from Vietnam, Kenya, and Phillipines The COVID-19 pandemic is the most significant shock to global and local food systems since the financial crisis of 2008. In the livestock sector, lockdowns and movement restrictions have significantly impacted animal trade, abattoirs, and consumer markets. The animal origins of COVID-19 have once again placed concerns about zoonotic diseases into the global policy limelight. Wet markets in Asia have been singled out as a source of global pandemic risk with calls to close, ban, regulate, and reform them. The concerns about wet markets centre heavily on wild animals and link calls for veterinary public health and biosecurity reforms with concerns about biological and ecological conservation, the (illegal) global wildlife trade, animal welfare and animal rights. However wild animals represent only a small fraction of the livestock sold at wet markets. While emerging pandemics represent low probability but high impact events, endemic food-borne and zoonotic diseases (Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli, etc.) contribute to more frequent and significant local disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the framing of wet markets as sources of disease and threats to biological diversity do not take into account their enduring positive contributions to local nutrition, livelihoods, and sociocultural wellbeing. Draconian governance and management reforms aimed solely at reducing zoonotic infection risks may have unintended negative socioeconomic, health and wellbeing consequences for communities and the resilience of food systems. This project will be led by RMIT, with expert partners from the Planetary and Global Health Program at St. Luke’s Medical Center College, one of the leading medical schools in the Philippines; the Institute for Anthropology, Gender and African Studies at the University of Nairobi, Kenya; and the Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences."

"Regular, Intense Exercise Training as a Healthy Aging Lifestyle Strategy: Preventing DNA Damage, Telomere Shortening and Adverse DNA Methylation Changes Over a Lifetime Telomeres; Leukocyte; Cellular Senescence Exercise training is one of the few therapeutic interventions that improves health span by delaying the onset of age-related diseases and preventing early death. The length of telomeres, the 5â€²-TTAGGGn-3â€² tandem repeats at the ends of mammalian chromosomes, is one of the main indicators of biological age. Telomeres undergo shortening with each cellular division. This subsequently leads to alterations in the expression of several genes that encode vital proteins with critical functions in many tissues throughout the body, and ultimately impacts cardiovascular, immune and muscle physiology. The sub-telomeric DNA is comprised of heavily methylated, heterochromatin. Methylation and histone acetylation are two of the most well-studied examples of the epigenetic modifications that occur on histone proteins. DNA methylation is the type of epigenetic modification that alters gene expression without modifying gene sequence. Although diet, genetic predisposition and a healthy lifestyle seem to alter DNA methylation and telomere length (TL), recent evidence suggests that training status or physical fitness are some of the major factors that control DNA structural modifications. In fact, TL is positively associated with cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity level (sedentary, active, moderately trained, or elite) and training intensity, but is shorter in over-trained athletes. Similarly, somatic cells are vulnerable to exercise-induced epigenetic modification, including DNA methylation. Exercise-training load, however, depends on intensity and volume (duration and frequency). Training load-dependent responses in genomic profiles could underpin the discordant physiological and physical responses to exercise. In the current review, we will discuss the role of various forms of exercise training in the regulation of DNA damage, TL and DNA methylation status in humans, to provide an update on the influence exercise training has on biological aging."

"Skilled migrant workplace integration: the choice between pragmatism and critical realism approaches Labour Market Integration; Emigrants and Immigrants; Earnings Gap This article provides a rationale for adopting the critical realism (CR) instead of pragmatism paradigm when researching skilled migrants' (SMs) workplace integration in Australia. While the extant SM literature has provided an abundance of â€˜explanations' reflecting the difficulties SMs face, it appears almost impossible for SMs to overcome some challenges such as discrimination or lack of local work experience. However, there is not a sufficient explanation for why many SMs have successfully integrated within the host labour market despite facing such difficulties. This study was designed to challenge what may have been â€˜taken-for-granted' in the literature and explore the causal relationship behind the SMsâ€™ difficulties and success. The CR paradigm provides a new way to examine the problems SMs face and their strategies to overcome such issues. It also empowers researchers to look beyond the empirical layer of evidence and explore how and why things happen the way they do."

"Smells like politics: planning and the inconvenient politics of intensive peri-urban agriculture Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems Intensive farming is an increasing part of Australian agriculture, including in the multi-functional landscapes at the edges of Australian cities. The example of intensive â€œbroilerâ€ poultry production reveals the tensions that arise when sites of hyper-productivity conflict with social change in rural areas. Planning processes for intensive farming in the Australian state of Victoria are predicated on stability and consensus: on assumed static and uncontroversial ideas of agriculture, its place, and the primacy of agricultural productivity. Yet concerns about the industrialisation of agriculture are live political issues at the local level, especially in dynamic peri-urban locations. This paper explores the emergence of a politics of place outside the bounds of planning consensus through an analysis of planning appeals and associated media relating to planning permits for intensive poultry developments in Victoria over 2011â€“2016. We highlight tensions that exist in relation to technical planning assessments and categorisations used to assert farming as the orthodox use of rural land, especially when new forms of farming look and feel demonstrably different. Using Mouffe's problematising of the negation of antagonism and RanciÃ¨re's notion of the risks of a false consensus democracy, we argue that planning processes for intensive farming illustrate critical issues in participatory planning. While ostensibly post-political decision-making narrows the politics of place and food systems to decisions about policing the boundaries and buffer distances placed around intensive poultry developments, alternative representations of rural life persist. The certainty offered by code-based planning does not negate the ongoing (if inconvenient) politics of intensive peri-urban agriculture."

"A state-and-transition model to guide grassland management Temperate Woodland; Exotic Species; Restoration Grassland ecosystems across the globe have been extensively modified and degraded by agriculture and urban development, leaving conservation managers with a complex set of interacting legacies and opportunities to contend with. We advocate the use of state-and-transition models to assist conservation managers to deal with this complexity. Using a major development and compensation project as a case study (The Melbourne Strategic Assessment under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999), we discuss the uses and limitations of state-and-transition models for conservation management. We define a state-and-transition model for an endangered Australian temperate grassland. Soil and vegetation data are used to evaluate the model and confirm that the assigned states relate to observable agro-ecological patterns. We then discuss the use of this model for several different interacting purposes: as a tool for the simple communication of complex ecological processes; as a tool for landscape stratification to aid the spatial application of management and experimentation; as a framework to set and define conservation objectives; and as an aide for adaptive management."

"Remelt processing and microstructure of selective laser melted Ti25Ta Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) In this study, elemental powder mixtures of Ti25Ta, an alloy with promise for orthopaedic applications, were processed using Selective Laser Melting (SLM), an emerging manufacturing method for bespoke implants. Material density and homogeneity was investigated as a function of laser scan speed and scanning strategy. Dense (>99.99%), pore free material was obtained at optimised processing parameters and a â€˜remeltâ€™ scan strategy improved melting of the Ta powders, avoiding keyhole formation. Tensile and ultrasonic modulus testing of the SLM Ti25Ta revealed that the processed material had a similar yield strength to SLM commercially pure Ti, namely 426 Â± 15 MPa, with a significant reduction of elastic modulus to 65 Â± 5 GPa. The remelt scan strategy increased the yield strength to 545 Â± 9 MPa, without altering the elastic modulus, however reduced the elongation from 25 Â± 1 to 11 Â± 4%. TEM analysis revealed the microstructure consisted of predominantly hexagonal Î±â€² martensite with a limited amount of orthorhombic Î±â€²â€² martensite formed in the Ta-rich regions near partially melted Ta particles, specifically facilitated by enhanced diffusion occurring during the remelt scan. The composition range for the Î±â€²â€² phase was observed to be approximately 40â€“50 wt% Ta. Electron back-scattered imaging (BSI) and back scattered diffraction (EBSD) revealed the formation of the prior Î² grains with close to equiaxed morphology and a slight texture in the Î±â€² martensite. The application of the remelt scan disrupted the prior Î² grain structure and resulted in randomly oriented Î±â€² laths."

"Next generation probiotics to enhance the gut health of chickens This project aims to identify and develop strains of bacteria that have superior properties and can reliably deliver positive outcomes in the face of the variable microbiotas found in the chicken gut. Thus, this project will address the issues identified with the existing first generation probiotics that were developed before there was an understanding of the very variable microbial environment that we now know is present in the gut of chickens. This variable microbial background is likely to be a key reason why broiler growers experience variable outcomes when using first generation probiotics. A conventional probiotic that can function well in one particular gut microbial environment may not perform well within other, different, gut microbial environments."

"Decentralized thermal storage to stabilize the electrical distribution network. This research is proposed to investigate the use of domestic hot water heaters with both autonomous and
centralized control to act as thermal energy storage with the intention to stabilize an electrical distribution network.
An appealing nature of domestic hot water heaters is that the existing electrical distribution infrastructure has
capacity to supply the water heaters and the thermal loads can respond rapidly when centrally controlled. This
indicates a large energy storage capability with low network capital investment and rapid deployment possibilities.

"Investigating undergraduate student learning experiences using the good practice learning and teaching for sustainability education (GPLTSE) framework Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Sustainability curriculum in higher education is a crucial lever for building capabilities and knowledge for graduates to address the interconnected social, ecological and economic challenges of the 21st century in their professional, and personal lives. A body of theory exists describing elements of good practice learning and teaching for sustainability in higher education which is accompanied by a small range of case studies reporting on sustainability courses and educational initiatives being undertaken in universities around the world. Often, such studies of practice are informed by post-hoc measures of effectiveness, rather than thorough evaluation frameworks informed by theories of good practice sustainability education and educational research methods. This paper aims to explore the lived experience of the theory of good practice learning and teaching for Sustainability Education using a holistic methodological framework. This paper firstly presents the theory of good practice learning and teaching for sustainability and summarises this in the Good Practice Learning and Teaching for Sustainability Education (GPLTSE) framework. This framework is then applied to the learning and teaching practices and student experiences of one undergraduate course in the built environment discipline that seeks to apply best practice educational approaches in course design and delivery. Using qualitative data collected from a mixed-methods case study of the course, along with the GPLTS framework, this paper highlights key factors enabling student engagement and positive learning experiences in this first-year undergraduate course. The findings have implications for pedagogy and also course evaluation approaches that aim to understand learning outcomes."

"Techno-economic evaluation tools development for hydrogen energy systems (Student:  Venkatakrishnan Balasubramanian) Australia has unique global advantage of having very large solar and wind based renewable energy sources. Australia can export its vast solar and wind resources via hydrogen (H2) transported as liquid ammonia (NH3) or in the form of various vectors. Both ammonia and hydrogen can be used as feedstock for industrial processes as well as fuel sources for thermal heat, vehicles and electricity. However, the process from the beginning to the end of production chain requires material input flow, capital and operating cost, energy footprint and carbon-di-oxide emission flow calculations with sensitivity analysis for comparison. There are number of technologies which need evaluation in the same way to compare between technologies and to understand key contributing inputs within a technology value chain.
Thus a generic tool and template sets are required to evaluate hydrogen energy systems.

"Housing wealth, mortgages and Australians’ labour force participation in later life Home Ownership; Housing Wealth; Real Estate Market In the life cycle model of consumption and saving, homeownership is an important vehicle for horizontal redistribution. Households accumulate wealth in owner-occupied housing during working lives before benefiting from imputed rent streams in retirement. But in some countries housing wealthâ€™s welfare role has broadened as owners increasingly use flexible mortgages to smooth consumption during working lives. One consequence is higher outstanding mortgages later in life, a burden exacerbated by high real house prices that compel home buyers to demand mortgages that are a growing multiple of their incomes. We investigate whether these developments are prompting longer working lives, an idea that is especially relevant in countries offering relatively low government pensions. Australia is one such country. We use the 2001â€“2017 panels of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey to estimate hazard models of exits from the Australian labour force as workers approach pensionable age. We find that those with high outstanding mortgage debts are more likely to postpone retirement, as are those with relatively low amounts of private pension wealth. These results are stronger in urban housing markets, and especially among males."
"Legitimacy theory: Despite its enduring popularity and contribution, time is right for a necessary makeover Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to reflect upon the contributions made to the social and environmental accounting literature by papers that comprised a 2002 Special Issue of Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal (AAAJ) entitled social and environmental reporting and its role in maintaining or creating organisational legitimacy. This paper will also provide insights into the origins of legitimacy theory as used in the social and environmental accounting literature as well as providing reflections about the strengths, and shortcomings, of the theory. Suggestions are made with respect to the ongoing application, and development, of legitimacy theory. Design/methodology/approach: As a commentary, this paper utilises a review of the social and environmental accounting and institutional literature across a number of decades to reveal insights about the development and use of legitimacy theory as a basis to explain social and environmental reporting practices. Citation data are also used to indicate the potential impact that the papers in the 2002 Special Issue had upon subsequent research. Findings: This commentary shows that the 2002 Special Issue is the most highly cited issue in the history of AAAJ. It also shows that individually, some of the papers in the Special Issue represent some of the most highly cited papers in the social and environmental accounting literature. The commentary provides arguments to suggest that the development of legitimacy theory is in need of further refinement, and suggests a way in which this refinement might take place. Research limitations/implications: This paper is largely based on the opinions of one researcher, and the evidence presented in the paper is selected on the basis that it is deemed sufficient to support the opinions being projected. The paper also relies on citation data as an indicator of â€œimpactâ€. The implication of the research is that it identifies a â€œway forwardâ€ for the development of theory applicable to the understanding of organisational social and environmental reporting practices. Originality/value: The study provides evidence to show that the 2002 Special Issue was significant within the context of AAAJ, and also within the context of the evolution of the social and environmental accounting literature. The description of the history of the development of legitimacy theory, and of the theoryâ€™s subsequent application, provides a solid impetus for future refinements to the theory."

"Assess the performance of chemical coagulation process for microplastics removal from stormwater Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Microplastic (MP) is considered as one of the emerging pollutants in marine environments. Because of low density and small particle size (<5 mm), MPs are easily discharged into open waterways by stormwater runoff. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of coagulation process for the removal of different types of MPs such as low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) from synthetic stormwater. The effect of different types of a coagulant such as alum and polyacrylamide (PAM), dosages of coagulants, solution pH and weathering conditions was investigated for the removal of MPs. Results found that a combination of alum and PAM performed better than standalone coagulant for MPs removal. The removal of all three types of MPs was high at low pH (3â€“5). It is also found that the removal efficiency of LDPE, HDPE and PP was 92 %, 84 % and 96 %, respectively under the weathering conditions. The mechanisms for MP removal were charge neutralization and hydrophobic interaction between MP and coagulant flocs. Overall, this study has confirmed that the coagulation process was very effective for removing MP particles under weathering conditions."
"'I didn't even know it was a thing': Australian young adults' experience of economic abuse Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Economics of Scale Economic abuse is a form of intimate partner violence that involves one partner controlling or restricting, exploiting or sabotaging the economic resources of the other partner. Little is known how economic abuse manifests in young people's relationships or how to prevent it. This study explored young adults' experiences of economic abuse and identified the factors associated with economic abuse in their relationships. Twenty-four young adults (18 women and 6 men) aged 18-29, were interviewed in-depth using both unstructured narrative and semi-structured interview questions. Thematic analysis was used to identify forms of economic abuse. Common experiences of economic abuse included: exploitation of financial and other resources, controlling access to money, damage to property and sabotage of employment and study. The contextual factors included lack of awareness of economic abuse, valuing love and relationships over money and fear of conflict and rejection. We argue that economic abuse prevention strategies should target young adults in their relationship formation stage and take into account the context of relationships and the issues young people face when venturing into cohabitation."
"Communication about sexual orientation and gender between clinicians, LGBT+ people facing serious illness and their significant others: A qualitative interview study of experiences, preferences and recommendations Transgender Persons; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Sexual Behavior Background Healthcare organisations have legal and ethical duties to reduce inequalities in access to healthcare services and related outcomes. However, lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender (LGBT+) people continue to experience and anticipate discrimination in health and social care. Skilled communication is vital for quality person-centred care, but there is inconsistent provision of evidence-based clinician education on health needs and experiences of LGBT+ people to support this. This study aimed to identify key stakeholders' experiences, preferences and best practices for communication regarding sexual orientation, gender identity and gender history in order to reduce inequalities in healthcare. Methods Semistructured qualitative interviews with LGBT+ patients with serious illness, significant others and clinicians, recruited via UK-wide LGBT+ groups, two hospitals and one hospice in England. We analysed the interview data using reflexive thematic analysis. Results 74 stakeholders participated: 34 LGBT+ patients with serious illness, 13 significant others and 27 multiprofessional clinicians. Participants described key communication strategies to promote inclusive practice across three domains: (1) â‚¬ Creating positive first impressions and building rapport' were central to relationship building and enacted through routine use of inclusive language, avoiding potentially negative non-verbal signals and echoing terminology used by patients and caregivers; (2) â‚¬ Enhancing care by actively exploring and explaining the relevance of sexual orientation and gender identity', participants described the benefits of clinicians initiating these discussions, pursuing topics guided by the patient's response or expressed preferences for disclosure. Active involvement of significant others was encouraged to demonstrate recognition of the relationship; these individual level actions are underpinned by a foundation of (3) â‚¬ visible and consistent LGBT+ inclusiveness in care systems'. Although participants expressed hesitance talking about LGBT+ identities with individuals from some sociocultural and religious backgrounds, there was widespread support for institutions to adopt a standardised, LGBT+ inclusive, visibly supportive approach. Conclusions Person-centred care can be enhanced by incorporating discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity into routine clinical practice. Inclusive language and sensitive exploration of relationships and identities are core activities. Institutions need to support clinicians through provision of adequate training, resources, inclusive monitoring systems, policies and structures. Ten inclusive communication recommendations are made based on the data."

"Creating a hierarchy of hazard control for urban stormwater management Catchment Area (Hydrology); Urban Runoff; Combined Sewers A hierarchy of hazard control was developed based on quantitative risk assessment models to manage human health risk from stormwater pollution. Urban stormwater reuse is becoming increasingly prevalent to overcome the serious urban water scarcity being experienced around the world. Therefore, the adoption of reliable approaches to minimise the human health risk posed by pollutants commonly present in urban stormwater such as heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is critical for safe stormwater reuse. This study collected a total of 40 pollutant build-up samples and analysed the concentrations of nine heavy metals and 15 PAH species. Based on pollutant build-up data, pollutant concentrations in stormwater were estimated through modelling. Risk assessment was conducted using an existing model developed by previous studies. The study outcomes confirmed that simply evaluating the individual pollutant concentrations based on guideline threshold values cannot comprehensively estimate the overall human health risk posed by these pollutants. Accordingly, it is recommended that the assessment of the overall human health risk should be based on the pollutant mix present as provided by the models discussed in this paper. The study also demonstrated the practical application of a robust risk assessment model to derive the hierarchy of hazard control to provide a reliable underpinning to urban stormwater risk management. The outcomes suggest that decentralised hazard control methods such as the provision of custom designed Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) measures can be implemented in priority areas with high risk from stormwater pollution based on the risk assessment undertaken. Distributed hazard control methods can be applied to reduce the generation of primary toxic pollutants, especially chromium (Cr) and heavy PAHs, through elimination and substitution measures. The percentage reduction in traffic volume required to mitigate the human health risk can be quantified through the risk models presented. The study outcomes will contribute to the development of efficient, targeted and reliable stormwater management strategies and to identify viable opportunities for stormwater reuse."
"‘Poor children on Tinder’ and their Barbie Saviours: towards a feminist political economy of volunteer tourism Volunteer Tourism; Voluntary Approach; Orphanages Barbie Saviours is a satirical Instagram account and linked Facebook page that depict white western Barbies volunteering in Africa with the bio, â€˜Jesus. Adventures. Africa. Two worlds. One love. Babies. Beauty. Not qualified. Called. 20 years old. Itâ€™s not about meâ€¦ but it kind of isâ€™. Drawing on emerging theories of feminist political economy, we address the growing backlash against volunteer tourism in the popular media and argue that critiques against these images reflect an anti-hegemonic project that highlights the role of sentimental colonialism in contemporary forms of international popular humanitarianism. Widely described as a critique against the â€˜White Saviour Complexâ€™, Barbie Saviour is used to popularise a negative image of western female volunteer tourists which currently comprise more than 75% of the industry. These critiques question the morality and legitimacy of female volunteer tourists as well as related spaces of western forms of development in the global south. These satires shine a spotlight on the neocolonial aura of the practice. However, we argue that while this critique is a productive reminder of the symbolic violence of racialised inequality, the critique itself also, albeit inadvertently, perpetuates the ahistorical and apolitical racial, ethnic, gender and class-based binary thinking that it seeks to condemn."

"Optimal parameter estimation in activated sludge process based wastewater treatment practice Activated Sludge; Waste Water; Crack Opening Displacement Activated sludge models (ASMs) are often used in the simulation of the wastewater treatment process to evaluate whether the effluent quality parameters of a wastewater treatment plant meet the standards. The premise of successful simulation is to choose appropriate dynamic parameters for the model. A niche based adaptive invasive weed optimization (NAIWO) algorithm is proposed in this paper to find the appropriate kinetic parameters of activated sludge model 1 (ASM1). The niche idea is used to improve the possibility of convergence to the global optimal solution. In addition, the adaptive mechanism and periodic operator are introduced to improve the convergence speed and accuracy of the algorithm. Finally, NAIWO is used to optimize the parameters of ASM1. Comparison with other intelligent algorithms such as invasive weed optimization (IWO), genetic algorithm (GA), and bat algorithm (BA) showed the higher convergence accuracy and faster convergence speed of NAIWO. The results showed that the ASM1 model results agreed with measured data with smaller errors."
"Development of effective and sustainable adsorbent biomaterial from an agricultural waste material: Cu(II) removal Mechanical Properties; Sisal; Coir Motivated by the significant scope which exists to generate value-added products from agricultural waste materials, in this work a comprehensive study was performed on the microstructure of alkali-treated coconut coir in order to evaluate its potential as an environmentally friendly absorbent. By investigating the influence of the alkali concentration, temperature and treatment time through a systematic Design of Experiments (DOE) approach, it was found that alkali-treated coconut coir possessed greatly improved water and moisture absorption properties (27% and 30% increases, respectively, compared to those of untreated coconut coir). The efficiency of heavy metal removal of treated coconut coir samples has been studied by investigating Cu (II) removal performance of selected samples with higher water and moisture absorbency. The effect of contact time and concentration of Cu (II) on the Cu (II) removal efficiency of samples have been investigated. The results show almost five times higher Cu (II) removal performance for the treated sample compared to raw coconut coir under optimized conditions. These findings highlight that the alkali treatment of biomaterials such as coconut coir can be used to tailor their water-absorbency properties as well as their adsorption properties, providing facile and effective adsorbent materials from readily available agricultural waste materials."

"Response of composite steel plate girder bridges subjected to debris fires Beams and Girders; Prestressed Concrete; Steel Bridge fires have been a serious concern for asset owners for decades. Considerable research work has been published on the assessment of bridges subjected to hydrocarbon fires and Wildland Urban Interfaces (WUI) fires like bushfires. However, the impact from fires that may have been generated due to onsite-accumulated debris, has been largely overlooked in the past. Prolonged duration of debris fires might well cause significant damage to the bridges, unless properly accounted during the design stage. The current study investigates the influence from debris-generated fires on steel girder bridges, using a reasonably validated advanced numerical modelling framework. Fire development was modelled first as a static, and then a travelling fire, using fire dynamic simulation (FDS) to capture the Adiabatic Surface Temperature (AST) development of the structure. The resulted AST was coupled with thermo-mechanical analysis using sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical analysis procedure in ABAQUS. The numerical model was used to estimate the temperature and displacement development of the bridge. The outcome from the study will facilitate asset managers for conducting necessary risk assessments incorporating the influence of onsite flammable debris for bridges."

"Assessing protected area networks in the conservation of elephants (Elephas Maximus) in Sri Lanka Conservation Areas; Elephants; Crop Damage Protected areas play a crucial role in the conservation and management of wildlife, but land use and land cover change (LULCC) threatens the status of protected areas. Sri Lanka has a history of severe humanâ€“elephant conflict (HEC). In the last 15 years, Sri Lanka has recorded the highest mortality of elephants and the second-highest human casualties among countries where the Asian elephant is native. In this study, we conducted a whole of country analysis of the effect of LULCC on protected areas using a land cover change map (1993â€“2018) recently developed by the authors using Landsat satellite data. Protected area performances were measured using five criteria including LULCC, the protected areas, and categorised into three performance levels. The protected area performances were then compared with number of HEC incidents. We found that 12% of Sri Lanka's protected area was affected by LULCC events, and every individual protected area experienced LULCC. We also found that 86% of elephant death incidents occurred within a 5 km radius of protected areas, with a strong negative correlation with distance from protected areas (r = â€“0.94, p < 0.05). Some 43% of HEC incidents and 23% of elephant deaths occurred inside protected areas, while 40% of elephant deaths in the last two years occurred inside protected areas. These areas were also found to fragment over time and elephant deaths increased, and showed a strong positive correlation, with fragmentation (r = 0.88, p < 0.05). Wildlife regions that experienced higher LULCC also experienced a greater number of elephant deaths, with a moderately positive correlation (r = 0.54, p < 0.05). Irrespective of the level of performance, all protected areas reported elephant deaths as well as HEC incidents, indicating that protected areas are failing to protect the endangered Elephas maximus population in Sri Lanka. These country-wide insights into protected areas can be used to re-evaluate the function and effectiveness of protected areas in managing and mitigating HEC while providing protection to elephants in Sri Lanka."

"The financial challenges for Australian nursing students attending placement-based work-integrated learning. Rural Health; Workforce; MONASH Model Background: Mandatory placement-based work-integrated learning (WIL) poses challenges for nursing students who work whilst studying. The financial burden of WIL links to other known direct and indirect challenges, yet no Australian study has quantified the financial challenges resulting from attending mandatory WIL placements. Placement-based WIL costs may preclude some students from completing WIL, which may impact student attrition and the future health workforce. Aim: To investigate Australian nursing studentsâ€™ financial challenges related to mandatory WIL. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey conducted with nursing students from nine Australian universities across five Australian states. The 28-question survey investigated the location of, and travels to, the most recent WIL placement; and studentsâ€™ employment, accommodation, financial support, expenses and debts, and financial strain pertaining to WIL placements. Results: Overall, 2,359 students participated. The majority were employed (84%); 65% of these reported that they were unable to work during WIL, affecting their employment. One-third incurred a financial liability from their placement, 79% reported financial hardship, and 73% found their placement stressful due to financial strain. Financial issues affected 62% of studentsâ€™ health and wellbeing. Discussion: Financial pressures related to WIL impact nursing students. While students have strategies to reduce these pressures, universities can also better manage their placement preferencing and support of students to reduce financial impacts of placement-based WIL on students. Conclusions: Nursing students face substantial financial challenges related to placement-based WIL. Scholarship programs and other forms of support are required to assist nursing students to undertake WIL."

"Novel pharmacological strategies to treat cognitive dysfunction in COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major incurable global health burden and is the 3rd largest cause of death worldwide. Up to 60% of COPD patients suffer from cognitive dysfunction (i.e. a brain disorder which affects learning, memory, attention) which often leads to dementia. The reason for this is unknown so the aim of this study is to determine why people with COPD suffer from mental disorders then develop novel treatments to treat these disorders in COPD patients."
"An analytical view on STEM education and outcomes: Examples of the social gap and gender disparity in Vietnam Birth Order; Siblings; Only Child United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goal 4, namely Quality Education, has highlighted major challenges for all nations to ensure inclusive and equitable quality access to education, facilities for children and young adults. The SDG4 is even more important for developing nations as receiving proper education or vocational training, especially in science and technology, means a foundational step in improving other aspects of their citizensâ€™ lives. However, the extant scientific literature about STEM education still lacks focus on developing countries, even more in rural areas. Using a dataset of 4967 observations of junior high school students from a rural area in a transition economy, the article employed the Bayesian approach to identify the association between gender, socio-economic status, and studentsâ€™ STEM academic achievements, which were measured by the average score of their most recent 45-minute standard school tests in STEM subjects: Maths, Physics, Chemistry (and Biology where applicable). The results reported that gender had little association with STEM academic achievements. However, female students appeared to have achieved better results than their male counterparts when their parents have non-manual jobs. Families with better economic status, parents with a high level of education, or non-manual jobs were associated with better study results. Also, students with zero or more than two siblings were correlated with lower study results than those with only one sibling.

"Research priorities and best practices for managing climate risk and climate change adaptation in Australian agriculture Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience The challenges of climate change adaptation in agriculture are examined through the lens of priorities for research, and the use of best management practices (BMPs) to better manage climate risks. The methods and results have two parts. Firstly, a case study from the northern grains region examines the use of BMPs for managing climate risks associated with both climate variability and climate change. A series of industry workshops developed and tested a suite of 24 BMP standards for growing dryland grain crops, including four BMPs on risk management based on the Australian Standards for Risk Management. Secondly, priorities for research on climate change adaptation in the primary industries sector are described and evaluated to assess needs for updating, in response to industry and environmental changes. The analysis reveals strong reasons for increasing the priority given to education and extension on risk management and for developing BMPs for both incremental and transformative adaptation, and especially for deriving methods to achieve widespread adoption of BMPs for managing extreme climatic events. Collaborative development of BMPs involving farmersâ€™/industry/scientists is the process most likely to derive robust BMPs to withstand the complexities of climate risk and build greater resilience of communities and ecosystems."
"Personalized medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases Personalized medicine is a model in which medical decisions and treatments are tailored to the individual patient based on the specific characteristics of their disease. With the rapidly falling cost of whole genome sequencing and the development of portable benchtop genome sequences such as the MinION, there is potential to implement this technology to enable a patient to receive personalized medicine in relation to treatment of infectious disease. The current barriers preventing the use of this technology in this approach are knowledge on 1) whether this type of sequencing can be performed directly on patient samples and 2) the genetic determinants of antifungal drug resistance which can be used as biomarkers to indicate drug resistance. This  funding will be used to assess the ability of MinION nanopore technology to rapidly diagnose pathogenic species from clinical samples and identify antifungal drug resistance biomarkers. The activity will commence as soon as funding is received. The clinical samples and isolates are located at the Alfred Hospital so some of the research will be performed there (by PhD student Samah Albehaijani) but the majority (genome sequencing and analysis) will be performed at RMIT.

"Closed Loop Food Production and the ‘Greening’ of Corrections Facilities: Using Composted Kitchen Waste for Fresh Food Production Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste Food represents a large proportion of putrescible waste in landfill in Australia, with very little food waste processed to recover resources. This has environmental impacts in the form of greenhouse gas generation and other externalities. Prisons typically waste high levels of food compared to the general community and, with the exception of a few small-scale and isolated composting examples in Australian prisons, the majority of prison food waste is sent to landfill. Internationally, especially in the U.S.A., the so-called â€˜greening of correctionsâ€™ has gained pace over the past few decades with the movement espousing similar objectives to certain United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. The literature suggests that prisoner participation in sustainability measures, environmental stewardship programs, landscape gardening and or agricultural/horticultural production decreases the chance of recidivism and is likely to improve the chance of post-release employment in the sustainability industry. As part of the greening of corrections, there are a number of examples of large-scale food waste composting operations used as the basis for significant, and often lucrative, fresh food production in prisons. Various U.S.A. prisons have demonstrated substantial waste disposal savings and further savings on fertilizers and fresh produce as a result of food waste composting processes. The types of food waste composting technologies and techniques utilised in these U.S.A. prisons, the savings in waste disposal fees and fertilizer costs, and the consequent food production could have beneficial impacts if modified for Australian conditions."
"Flexible employment policies, temporal control and health promoting practices: A qualitative study in two Australian worksites Work-Family Conflict; Work-Life Balance; Personnel For four decades, theories of job demand-control have proposed that higher occupational status groups have lower health risks due to the stress accompanying jobs featuring high demands but high control. This research examines whether Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) can improve the health prospects of a range of workers by giving greater control over work time arrangements. Our setting is Australia, where FWAs were introduced in 2009. In line with these early studies alongside studies of work-life balance, we expected to observe that workers with access to control over daily work times could better control the activities outside of work that influence chronic disease. Using a practice sociology approach, we compared the accounts of twenty-eight workers in blue and white collar industries with differing degrees of work time flexibility. The findings do not contradict early theories describing occupational differences of job demand-control dynamics and their relationship to health risks. However, this study suggests that a) time demands and strains have increased for a broad sweep of workers since the 1980s, b) the greater control of higher occupational status groups has been eroded by the high performance movement, which has attracted less scrutiny than FWAs, and c) more workers are forced to adapt their daily lives, including their approach to health, to accommodate their job demands. Job insecurity further impedes preventative health practices adoption. What might appear to be worker-controlled flexibility can-under the pressures of job insecurity and performance expectations without time limits-transform into health-eroding unpredictability. The answer however is not greater flexibility in the absence of limits on the well-documented precursors of work stress: long hours, job insecurity and intensity-related exhaustion. While there have been welcome developments in job demand-control-health conceptualizations, they typically ignore the out-of-work temporal demands that workers face and which compound on-the-job demands. Redesign of the temporalities of working life within worksites need to be accompanied by society-level policies which address caring responsibilities, gender equality as well as broad labour market conditions."
"'I didn't even know it was a thing': Australian young adults' experience of economic abuse Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Economics of Scale Economic abuse is a form of intimate partner violence that involves one partner controlling or restricting, exploiting or sabotaging the economic resources of the other partner. Little is known how economic abuse manifests in young people's relationships or how to prevent it. This study explored young adults' experiences of economic abuse and identified the factors associated with economic abuse in their relationships. Twenty-four young adults (18 women and 6 men) aged 18-29, were interviewed in-depth using both unstructured narrative and semi-structured interview questions. Thematic analysis was used to identify forms of economic abuse. Common experiences of economic abuse included: exploitation of financial and other resources, controlling access to money, damage to property and sabotage of employment and study. The contextual factors included lack of awareness of economic abuse, valuing love and relationships over money and fear of conflict and rejection. We argue that economic abuse prevention strategies should target young adults in their relationship formation stage and take into account the context of relationships and the issues young people face when venturing into cohabitation."

"Enhancing greywater treatment via MHz-Order surface acoustic waves Surface Acoustic Wave; Droplet; Interdigital Transducers There is a pressing need for efficient biological treatment systems for the removal of organic compounds in greywater given the rapid increase in household wastewater produced as a consequence of rapid urbanisation. Moreover, proper treatment of greywater allows its reuse that can significantly reduce the demand for freshwater supplies. Herein, we demonstrate the possibility of enhancing the removal efficiency of solid contaminants from greywater using MHz-order surface acoustic waves (SAWs). A key distinction of the use of these high frequency surface acoustic waves, compared to previous work on its lower frequency (kHz order) bulk ultrasound counterpart for wastewater treatment, is the absence of cavitation, which can inflict considerable damage on bacteria, thus limiting the intensity and duration, and hence the efficiency enhancement, associated with the acoustic exposure. In particular, we show that up to fivefold improvement in the removal efficiency can be obtained, primarily due to the ability of the acoustic pressure field in homogenizing and reducing the size of bacterial clusters in the sample, therefore providing a larger surface area that promotes greater bacteria digestion. Alternatively, the SAW exposure allows the reduction in the treatment duration to achieve a given level of removal efficiency, thus facilitating higher treatment rates and hence processing throughput. Given the low-cost of the miniature chipscale platform, these promising results highlight its possibility for portable greywater treatment for domestic use or for large-scale industrial wastewater processing through massive parallelization."

"Impact of transport policies to commuter safety in urban cities of a developing country: A sustainability and system perspective Sustainability; Rating System; Passenger Transport Accident-related deaths are a major problem in road transportation, especially in developing countries. Despite the legislation, death statistics continue to increase annually. This study aimed to assess transport policies that promote a reduction in road deaths in Metro Cebu, Philippines. A conceptual model is proposed to characterize the transportation system, with sustainability dimensions as its framework. System dynamics modeling was used to simulate the influence of three transport policies on the number of road deaths, and regression analysis was used to mathematically represent the behavior of the system. The results indicated that increasing the number of newly hired traffic enforcers, along with dynamic vehicle operation restrictions, resulted in a considerable reduction in road deaths. However, increasing the annual budget for road maintenance only showed minimal improvements. The findings of this study provide insights for policymakers on how to better manage the dynamic behavior of the transportation system while ensuring the safety of the community."

"Informal Networks, Informal Institutions, and Social Exclusion in the Workplace: Insights from Subsidiaries of Multinational Corporations in Korea Guanxi; China; Managerial Ties Drawing on interviews with decision makers in multinational corporations (MNCs) in South Korea, we examine the role of informal networks in the social exclusion of women in the workforce. Although legislation in the country is in favor of gender equality, we found that informal barriers in the workplace remain difficult to overcome. Informal networks in Korea, yongo, present an ethical issue in the workplace, as they tend to socially exclude women, limiting possibilities for their participation and career progression. We found that informal networks are pervasive and strong because of the informal institutions in which they are embedded and that there is a complex interplay between informal networks and informal institutions that socially excludes women. Due to difficulties accessing yongo, women appear to build inmaek, a network type that is more open and accessible. We also found that MNCs in Korea can compensate for the lack of local informal networks for their female employees. However, despite providing a more supportive environment for women at work, gender equality policies in MNCs are not yet as effective as they could be due to the dynamics of the workplace and the fact that the policies are not tailored to the local context. We have seen evidence in recent years that MNCs can serve as role models for implementing gender equality policies by creating a more inclusive work environment and demonstrating leadership commitment and support."

"Does corporate social responsibility mediate the relation between boardroom gender diversity and firm performance of Chinese listed companies? Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence Although the relationship between board gender diversity and a firm's financial performance has been investigated before, the current study provides a valuable contribution by exploring the complex phenomenon of the mediating impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance on a firm's financial performance. The current study aims to explore whether corporate social responsibility (represented by the proxy variable of CSR reporting) mediates the relationship between boardroom gender diversity and firm performance. We use the pooled ordinary least square (OLS) regression to examine the above relationship by using data from 2008 to 2015. To control the likelihood of endogeneity we also use one-year lagged and two-stage least square (2SLS) regression models. Our results show that boardroom gender diversity is significant, positively correlated with firm performance, and CSR fully mediates the relationship between boardroom gender diversity and firm performance. In addition, four control variables (independent director, Chief executive officer (CEO power), board member meeting frequency, Big4, and leverage) have some influence on firm performance. These findings hold for a set of robustness tests. Our findings have the implication for the investors and regulators. For investors, our results show that the existence of female directors on the board can improve the firm performance. For regulators, our results advise the worldwide policy maker to give the importance to boardroom gender diversity. The paper contributes to the existing studies, by pioneering the investigations of the mediating role of CSR in the relation between boardroom gender diversity and firm performance in Chinese context."
"Accounting professionalisation in Brazil: Resistance and co-optation in the introduction of a professional entry exam (1999–2010) Accounting Profession; Accountants; Professionalization Using actorâ€“network theory, this study investigates how the CFC (Conselho Federal de Contabilidade â€“ Federal Council of Accounting) in Brazil transformed into a full-fledged professional accounting body with entry controls. The CFC lacked an entry control mechanism after its establishment in 1946, but introduced a professional entry exam in 2010 after failed attempts between 1999 and 2004. In 2004, resistance from higher education accounting students and the Brazilian Ministry of Education led to the suspension of the non-legislated entry examination that the CFC had administered since 1999. After 2004, the CFC co-opted resisting actors and reframed its move by invoking the emerging national agenda of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption. The CFC used this agenda to facilitate co-optation with the state by justifying the need to bring Brazilâ€™s accounting regulatory landscape into line with international best practices suited to IFRS-based reporting."

"Procurement Issues in Donor-Funded International Development Projects Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management This study investigated the critical procurement challenges faced by international development (ID) projects in Bangladesh. Initially, a framework of challenges was developed via literature review. We then ranked the importance of these challenges and categorized them based on interview data and analytical hierarchy processing analysis. Interviews were conducted with procurement experts from three major ID project stakeholder groups: donor organizations, host country government policymakers, and project implementation units. The most important categories of challenges were those related to project management capacity/capability, and ethics. More specifically, the challenges deemed most important were those related to improper project planning, undue practices in procurement implementation, government bureaucracy and interference in procurement, and inexperienced procurement staff. This paper contributes to the ID project procurement literature by identifying the critical challenges to procurement, which differ from those of other project-related areas. The findings may assist the multibillion-dollar ID project procurement industry in Bangladesh by highlighting the major issues that require effective management by all stakeholders. Ultimately, this may improve procurement outcomes and overall project performance."

"Assessing ecosystem resilience to a tropical cyclone based on ecosystem service supply proficiency using geospatial techniques and social responses in coastal Bangladesh Cultural Ecosystem Services; China; Natural Capital Ecosystem services are essential for the livelihoods of marginalized communities; however, their supply can be severely disturbed when natural hazards impact on low-lying coastal regions. To understand potential disaster impacts on sustainable livelihoods, ecosystem resilience needs to be assessed before and after a disaster. We examined ecosystem resilience to a tropical cyclone in a southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh in terms of its impacts on the ecosystem's service supply proficiency (ESSP). We adopted a two-tiered methodology commencing with landcover mapping using object-based image analysis (OBIA) to identify five distinct landcovers (cropland, mangrove forest, riparian forest, tidal flat, and sandy beach). Then, Likert scores were used to reflect human perceptions of the supply proficiency of three types of ecosystem services (provisioning, regulating, and cultural services) associated with each landcover. The resilience of each landcover type was assessed by integrating maps of damage and recovery with the Likert scores to calculate ESSP scores. A substantial post-cyclone reduction in ESSP scores was revealed. Significant recovery (both short- and long-term) was observed in most of the affected ecosystems, albeit at somewhat different rates for different ecosystems. This study provides a multi-faceted evaluation of cyclone impacts on existing ecosystems and insight into ecosystem behaviour at different temporal phases of a disaster event. Accordingly, the study offers a novel way to study ecosystem resilience to support effective coastal planning within a vulnerable coastal community."

"Higher Education in Times of Instability and Disruption: Rethinking Notions of Values, Value Creation and Instructional Practices in Vietnam and beyond Employability; Competency; Soft Skills The disruptive nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a massive shift in instructional practices in higher education across the globe. The impact of this pandemic on education globally has led to a surge in online teaching and the use of various digital technologies and platforms to support instructional practices. However, this world-changing event has foregrounded the limitations of technology in addition to other important indications, particularly as it relates to the notion of value and by extension value creation. Within the context of the Vietnamese higher education ecosystem, what is evident is that a re-evaluation of values is worth considering, in terms of the value of local higher education institutions, in addition to the value creation produced by the same. This article will engage with pertinent implications for the post-COVID realities which offer untold challenges and opportunities in Vietnam and elsewhere. Moreover, the post-COVID realities of late modernity only serve to accentuate the importance of values and value creation in this context as higher education institutions would re-evaluate, rethink, and retool approaches to instructional practices. A focus on questions of value aids in considering the broader conditions and contexts which support some of the fruitful and situated outcomes of higher education which includes human capital development, employment, social mobility and the production of modern social identities."
"Reusing COVID-19 disposable nitrile gloves to improve the mechanical properties of expansive clay subgrade: An innovative medical waste solution Compressive Strength; Atterberg Limit; Polypropylene Fiber The COVID-19 pandemic not only poses an unprecedented threat to global health but also severely disrupts the natural environment and ecosystems. Mitigating the adverse impacts of plastic-based personal protective equipment (PPE) waste requires the cooperation of professionals from various fields. This paper discusses a novel, cleaner approach to soil stabilisation by repurposing the nitrile gloves into a sustainable road material to improve the mechanical properties of expansive clay soil as pavement subgrade. For the first time, extensive geotechnical testings, including standard compaction, unconfined compressive strength (UCS), unsoaked California bearing ratio (CBR), repeated load triaxial (RLT), and swelling-shrinkage tests, were carried out to investigate the engineering performance of different proportions of the shredded nitrile gloves (SNG) (e.g., 1%, 1.5%, 2%) were blended with expansive clay (EC). In addition, surface roughness, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray micro-CT analyses were conducted, and images were obtained to study the microstructural modification of the EC-SNG mixtures. The experimental results indicated that the blend of expansive clay with SNG helped in increasing the compressive strength, resilient modulus, and CBR and assisted in reducing the swelling and shrinkage of the soil. SEM and surface roughness analyses indicated the interaction between the soil matrix interface and the rough surface of the SNG. The main reasons for increasing the strength and stability of clay soil could be attributed to the high tensile strength of the SNG and the formation of the three-dimensional grid, and friction between the soil particles and SNG. According to the X-ray micro-CT test results, the incorporation of SNG led to an increase in closed porosity."
"Genomic Literacy of Registered Nurses and Midwives in Australia: A Cross-Sectional Survey Genetic Knowledge; Nursing; Genomics Purpose: Registered nurses and midwives require a degree of genomic literacy if they are to adequately communicate with other healthcare professionals and provide optimal care to patients, their families, and the community. Several studies have been conducted internationally to assess the genomic literacy of nurses; however, the genomic literacy of Australian registered nurses and midwives has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to measure the genomic literacy of Australian registered nurses and midwives through assessing participantsâ€™ understandings of genomic concepts most critical to nursing and midwifery practice, as well as their perceived knowledge and attitude towards genomics in nursing and midwifery practice. Design: Cross-sectional survey of Australian registered nurses and midwives using the Genomic Nursing Concept Inventory (GNCIÂ©), a 31 multiple-choice question survey instrument. Participants were recruited via two key Australian nursing and midwifery organizations over an 8-month period in 2016. Methods: Descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were used to calculate the total GNCIÂ© score and scores on individual subcategories, as well as relationships between demographic variables and GNCIÂ© scores. Findings: Most respondents worked as clinicians (71.4%) in a hospital or hospital-based setting (61.8%). Most registered nurses (80.5%) and midwives (97.2%) reported that genetics was relevant to clinical practice; however, over 80% of registered nurses and midwives believed their knowledge of genetics was poor or average. Genomic knowledge was assessed using the GNCIÂ©. Scores ranged from 3 to 29 (out of a possible 31), with a mean score of 13.3 (SD 4.559) based on 253 (N = 253) respondents, indicating that genomic literacy is low. There was a significant difference between genomic knowledge scores and education and training level (p =.036). Conclusions: The genomic literacy of registered nurses and midwives in Australia is low. More must be done to ensure Australian registered nurses and midwives have an adequate level of genomic literacy to provide optimal care to patients, their families, and the community. Clinical Relevance: Modern medicine requires a healthcare workforce that is literate in genomics. Findings from this study may serve as the catalyst to improve the genomic literacy of the Australian nursing and midwifery workforce, allowing for improved health outcomes for individuals and the wider Australian public."

"Prediction of Field-Scale Wheat Yield Using Machine Learning Method and Multi-Spectral UAV Data Crops; Leaf Area Index; Hyperspectral Data Accurate prediction of food crop yield is of great significance for global food security and regional trade stability. Since remote sensing data collected from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms have the features of flexibility and high resolution, these data can be used as samples to develop regional regression models for accurate prediction of crop yield at a field scale. The primary objective of this study was to construct regional prediction models for winter wheat yield based on multi-spectral UAV data and machine learning methods. Six machine learning methods including Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) were used for the construction of the yield prediction models. Ten vegetation indices (VIs) extracted from canopy spectral images of winter wheat acquired from a multi-spectral UAV at five key growth stages in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, China in 2021 were selected as the variables of the models. In addition, in situ measurements of wheat yield were obtained in a destructive sampling manner for prediction algorithm modeling and validation. Prediction results of single growth stages showed that the optimal model was GPR constructed from extremely strong correlated VIs (ESCVIs) at the filling stage (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 49.22 g/m2, MAE = 42.74 g/m2). The results of multiple stages showed GPR achieved the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 49.18 g/m2, MAE = 42.57 g/m2) when the ESCVIs of the flowering and filling stages were used. Larger sampling plots were adopted to verify the accuracy of yield prediction; the results indicated that the GPR model has strong adaptability at different scales. These findings suggest that using machine learning methods and multi-spectral UAV data can accurately predict crop yield at the field scale and deliver a valuable application reference for farm-scale field crop management."

"Toward sustainable environmental quality: Identifying priority research questions for Latin America PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs The Global Horizon Scanning Project (GHSP) is an innovative initiative that aims to identify important global environmental quality research needs. Here we report 20 key research questions from Latin America (LA). Members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) LA and other scientists from LA were asked to submit research questions that would represent priority needs to address in the region. One hundred questions were received, then partitioned among categories, examined, and some rearranged during a workshop in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Twenty priority research questions were subsequently identified. These research questions included developing, improving, and harmonizing across LA countries methods for 1) identifying contaminants and degradation products in complex matrices (including biota); 2) advancing prediction of contaminant risks and effects in ecosystems, addressing lab-to-field extrapolation challenges, and understanding complexities of multiple stressors (including chemicals and climate change); and 3) improving management and regulatory tools toward achieving sustainable development. Whereas environmental contaminants frequently identified in these key questions were pesticides, pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors or modulators, plastics, and nanomaterials, commonly identified environmental challenges were related to agriculture, urban effluents, solid wastes, pulp and paper mills, and natural extraction activities. Several interesting research topics included assessing and preventing pollution impacts on conservation protected areas, integrating environment and health assessments, and developing strategies for identification, substitution, and design of less hazardous chemicals (e.g., green chemistry). Finally, a recurrent research need included developing an understanding of differential sensitivity of regional species and ecosystems to environmental contaminants and other stressors. Addressing these critical questions will support development of long-term strategic research efforts to advance more sustainable environmental quality and protect public health and the environment in LA.

"Ultra-Broadband Directional Scattering by Colloidally Lithographed High-Index Mie Resonant Oligomers and Their Energy-Harvesting Applications Enhancement; Organic Photovoltaics; Plasmonics Emerging high-index all-dielectric nanostructures, capable of manipulating light on the subwavelength scale, empower designing and implementing novel antireflection and light-trapping layers in many photonic and optoelectronic devices. However, their performance and practicality are compromised by relatively narrow bandwidths and highly sophisticated fabrications. In this paper, we demonstrate an ultra-broadband (300-1200 nm) directional light scattering strategy using high-index surface silicon oligomer resonators fabricated by a facile, scalable, and low-cost colloidal lithography technique. The exceptional broadband forward scattering stems from a combined effect of strongly intercoupled Mie resonances within the oligomers composed of randomly positioned nanodisks in the visible region and a strong electric mode coupling between the oligomers and the high-index substrate in the red-to-near-infrared region. By implementing this efficient approach in silicon solar cells, the integrated optical reflection loss across the wavelength range 300-1200 nm can be as low as 7%. Consequently, the short-circuit current density determined from the external quantum efficiency of solar cells can be increased to 35.1 from 25.1 mA/cm2, representing an enhancement of 40%, with a demonstrated energy conversion efficiency exceeding 15.0%. The insights in this paper hold great potentials for new classes of light management and steering photonic devices with drastically improved practicality."
"Investment decisions: The trade-off between economic and environmental objectives Sustainability; Environmental Management Systems; Eco-Management and Audit Scheme While there are broader socio-political, psychological, and structural factors that influence investment decisions (see Harris et al., 2016), in line with the critical approach, this study provides an empirical insight into the notion that financialization, specifically the tendency to prioritise economic over environmental objectives, has a strong bearing on how managers view investment trade-off decisions in relation to sustainability issues. The study empirically investigates this notion by examining the investment tradeâ€“off preferences of Australian managers in relation to three decision attributes â€“ economic outcomes (i.e. financial returns), environmental impact (i.e. carbon emissions) and stakeholder pressure to consider environmental issues. We use the discrete choice experimental method to quantify the trade-offs between the above mentioned three attributes. In addition, we also investigate the potential effect of three contingency factors on individual's preferences. Specifically, at the organisational level, we explore the effects of financial and environmental rewards and at the individual level, we explore the effect of environmental consciousness. In line with the financialization hypotheses our results indicate that managers prioritise financial returns over carbon emissions and stakeholder pressures with the preference for financial returns found to be positively associated with rewards for financial performance. However, in line with the pragmatic approach and despite the overall dominance of financial returns, there is evidence that manager's focus on financial returns can be influenced, with the preference for financial returns negatively associated with rewards for environmental performance and environmental consciousness. In addition, while stakeholder pressure was not found to be associated with any of the three contingency factors and, manager's emphasis on carbon emissions was not associated with financial rewards, manager's emphasis on carbon emissions was found to be positively associated with both rewards for environmental performance and environmental consciousness. Therefore, our findings suggest that corporate management have an important role to play, both in respect to the design of performance rewards systems and the recruitment of environmentally conscious managers, in order to promote the sustainability agenda."

"Has tourism driven house prices in Germany? Time-varying evidence since 1870 Hedonic Analysis; Property Values; Hedonic Pricing Using a historical data set and recent advances in non-parametric time series modelling, we investigate the nexus between tourism flows and house prices in Germany over nearly 150 years. We use time-varying non-parametric techniques given that historical data tend to exhibit abrupt changes and other forms of non-linearities. Our findings show evidence of a time-varying effect of tourism flows on house prices, although with mixed effects. The pre-World War II time-varying estimates of tourism show both positive and negative effects on house prices. While changes in tourism flows contribute to increasing housing prices over the post-1950 period, this is short-lived, and the effect declines until the mid-1990s. However, we find a positive and significant relationship after 2000, where the impact of tourism on house prices becomes more pronounced in recent years."
"Atomically dispersed nickel as coke-resistant active sites for methane dry reforming Catalyst; Steam Reforming; Synthesis Gas Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is an attractive route to utilize CO2 as a chemical feedstock with which to convert CH4 into valuable syngas and simultaneously mitigate both greenhouse gases. Ni-based DRM catalysts are promising due to their high activity and low cost, but suffer from poor stability due to coke formation which has hindered their commercialization. Herein, we report that atomically dispersed Ni single atoms, stabilized by interaction with Ce-doped hydroxyapatite, are highly active and coke-resistant catalytic sites for DRM. Experimental and computational studies reveal that isolated Ni atoms are intrinsically coke-resistant due to their unique ability to only activate the first C-H bond in CH4, thus avoiding methane deep decomposition into carbon. This discovery offers new opportunities to develop large-scale DRM processes using earth abundant catalysts."
"Gender Equity in the Marketing Academy: From Performative to Institutional Allyship Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science The fair treatment of women in the workplace, where they experience both opportunities and constraints, has been on and off higher education agendas for decades. Yet, institutionalised gendered constraints still shape the careers of female academics, including those in the marketing academy, resulting in disrupted or obstacle-heavy career journeys and the underrepresentation of women in senior positions. Furthermore, progress towards gender equity is hampered by institutional resistance to change, favouring performative rather than genuine and transformational institutional allyship. We draw upon personal experiences, recollections and anecdotes garnered over the years â€“ synthesised with literature â€“ to examine systemic gendered constraints within our collective career span. We propose institutional allyship as the intentional efforts needed by the marketing academy to address systemic and structural gender inequities and achieve second-order change by integrating gender equity outcomes throughout organisational decision-making. Specifically, we suggest nominated actions within a Gender Equity and Inclusion Charter for the Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy (ANZMAC) and its member universities as a first step."

"Reframing resilience as resistance: Situating disaster recovery within colonialism Biopolitics; Governmentality; Disaster This paper challenges resilience literature, which often strips grassroots actors of their political agency and reduces their resilient actions to no more than adapting, mitigating or recovering from an exogenous hazard. I apply an everyday resistance framework to unpack Puerto Ricansâ€™ responses to the impacts of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the Caribbean Island in 2017. This methodological approach situates acts of resilience within the colonial relations that characterise the United Statesâˆ’Puerto Rico relationship. First, peopleâ€™s acts of resilience are shown to signify acts of resistance to pursue self-determination and relinquish their dependency on the United States for their everyday lives and disaster recovery. Second, the paper demonstrates how resistance is enacted by women in the domestic space, which challenges masculinist and patriarchal notions of resistance. Third, exploring resilience â€œfrom belowâ€ is suggested to expose how state-centric conceptualisations of resilience do not fit neatly with how disaster-affected people define and intuitively enact resilience."
"Relevant phenotypic descriptors of the resonance Norway spruce standing trees for the acoustical quality of wood for musical instruments Elastic Modulus; Lumber; Fiber Saturation Identifying high-grade valuable wood resources by the visible individual traits of trees is a challenge for foresters and a requirement for sustainable resource management. The aim of this study was to identify the most relevant phenotypic descriptors of the acoustic quality of Norway spruce standing timber. Two highly valuable Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands located in the Romanian Carpathians were selected for this purpose. A total of 27 tree, bole, bark, and crown variables and nine variables related to wood structure were statistically checked against the velocities of stress waves measured on standing trees at breast height, and the derived parameters: the radiation, the impedance, and the moduli of elasticity in L and R directions. Principal component analysis was used for exploratory data analysis as well as mixed linear models were involved in explaining these acoustics. There were consistent variations in the measured acoustics from tree to tree, according to the age and social class. Wood acoustical parameters measured in the R direction are better predicted by tree phenotype than the acoustical parameters measured in the L direction. Bark thickness and branch width were the best predictors, while tree ring features were less predictive. At a given age, trees with high velocity had thinner and reddisher bark, thinner branches, and a narrower crown. Trees with high velocity anisotropy had narrower branches and wider sapwood. Furthermore, the phenotypic traits used had a poor explanatory power of the radiation ratio. In conclusion, spruce standing trees from the studied area bring forward certain outside features that enable us the multitrait identification of highly valuable wood for string instruments."

"Oxidative degradation of bisphenol A in municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) using ferrate(VI)/hydrogen peroxide Ferrate Ion; Disinfection; Oxidation The combination of ferrate(VI) with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) spiked in municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC). The results showed that the combined Fe(VI) and H2O2 oxidant provided an additive effect to achieve greater degradation efficiencies of BPA in ROC compared to the use of Fe(VI) or H2O2 alone. The degradation efficiency of BPA was studied in detail by assessing the operating conditions, including Fe(VI) dosage, H2O2 dosage, the dosing strategy of Fe(VI) and H2O2, solution pH, and the initial concentration of BPA. It was found that over 99.0% of BPA was degraded (50 Âµg Lâˆ’1) by using [Fe(VI)]/[H2O2] at a ratio of 1050:5000 and at pH 8.0. In addition, the degradation was also accompanied by 37.2% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal and 94.0% of UV254 reduction. However, when the excess amount of H2O2 was added, it was found that H2O2 started to inhibit the degradation and the degradation efficiency of BPA in ROC lowered. It was also found that the simultaneous addition of Fe(VI) and H2O2 provided satisfactory BPA degradation. Similar degradation efficiency could be achieved by injecting the second oxidant into the system 10 min after adding the first oxidant at time zero. The apparent second-order reaction rate constant (kapp) obtained was 67.9 Ã— 103 Mâˆ’1 sâˆ’1 at a [Fe(VI)]/[H2O2] ratio of 1050:5000. The overall ecotoxicity of the treated water samples as measured by the Microtox bioassay technique decreased after the Fe(VI)/H2O2 treatment, which indicated that an insignificant amount, if not none, toxic degradation by-products was formed by the oxidative action of the Fe(VI)/H2O2 combined oxidant. The use of Fe(VI)/H2O2 as an alternative treatment option of cost-effectiveness than Fe(VI) alone in water and wastewater industries."

"Mobile money and women’s decision-making power in India Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion In this chapter, the authors use data from the Financial Inclusion Insights (FII) program to examine the association between mobile money and female decision-making power in India. Drawing on different proxies for female decision-making power, the authors show that awareness of, and the use of, mobile money is not sufficient to change behaviours and cultural norms. The authors argue that programs designed to encourage women to take up mobile money products will not be successful unless women actively utilise these bank accounts. The chapter provides some policy insights on how to promote empowerment using financial technologies in cash-based economies such as India."

"What is going on in magnesium alloys? Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals China has been developed into one of the most active regions in terms of both fundamental and applied research on magnesium (Mg) and its alloys in the world from a solid base laid by its prominent metallurgist and materials scientists over the past decades. Nowadays, a large number of young-generation researchers have been inspired by their predecessors and become the key participants in the fields of Mg alloys, which consequently led to the establishment of China Youth Scholar Society for Magnesium Alloys Research in 2015. Since then, the first two China Youth Scholars Symposiums on Mg Alloys Research had been held at Harbin (2015) and Chongqing (2016) China, respectively. A number of crucial research interests related to fundamental and applied Mg research were discussed at the conferences and summarized in this short perspective, aiming to boost far-reaching initiatives for development of new Mg-based materials to satisfy the requirements for a broad range of industrial employments. Herein, four main aspects are included as follows: i) Plastic deformation mechanism and strengthening strategy, ii) Design and development of new Mg-based materials, iii) Key service properties, and iv) New processing technologies."

"Dietary Uptake and Depuration Kinetics of Perfluorooctane Sulfonate, Perfluorooctanoic Acid, and Hexafluoropropylene Oxide Dimer Acid (GenX) in a Benthic Fish Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitously distributed throughout aquatic environments and can bioaccumulate in organisms. We examined dietary uptake and depuration of a mixture of 3 PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C8HF15O2), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS; C8HF17SO3), and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HPFO-DA; C6HF11O3; trade name GenX). Benthic fish (blue spot gobies, Pseudogobius sp.) were fed contaminated food (nominal dose 500 ng gâ€“1) daily for a 21-d uptake period, followed by a 42-d depuration period. The compounds PFOA, linear-PFOS (linear PFOS), and total PFOS (sum of linear and branched PFOS) were detected in freeze-dried fish, whereas GenX was not, indicating either a lack of uptake or rapid elimination (<24 h). Depuration rates (dâ€“1) were 0.150 (PFOA), 0.045 (linear-PFOS), and 0.042 (linear+branched-PFOS) with corresponding biological half-lives of 5.9, 15, and 16 d, respectively. The PFOS isomers were eliminated differently, resulting in enrichment of linear-PFOS (70â€“90%) throughout the depuration period. The present study is the first reported study of GenX dietary bioaccumulation potential in fish, and the first dietary study to investigate uptake and depuration of multiple PFASs simultaneously, allowing us to determine that whereas PFOA and PFOS accumulated as expected, GenX, administered in the same way, did not appear to bioaccumulate.

"Source and central level recovery of nutrients from urine and wastewater: A state-of-art on nutrients mapping and potential technological solutions Struvite; Waste Water; Phosphorus Wastewater treatment facilities typically transform nitrogen compounds into innocuous nitrogen. Phosphorous is partially recovered in biosolids while the potassium cycle in the treatment process is still not well mapped. This paper provides a mapping of the nutrients from household sources (urine, faeces and greywater) to wastewater in the traditional wastewater treatment plants. Following this mapping, the article critically reviews the nutrients recovery technologies, including their applicability at source (for urine) and centralised (for wastewater) levels, benchmarking, social acceptance, and techno-commercial assessments. Additionally, the paper has identified the current technological challenges and opportunities as well as suggested a several future recommendations for developing commercially viable nutrient recovery technologies from urine at source level and wastewater at wastewater treatment plants (centralised level). The high energy requirement, high cost and safety issues are some of the common challenges for most of the nutrient recovery technologies. However, anaerobic membrane bioreactor integrated with biochar or zeolite (for wastewater) and biosorption (for both urine and wastewater) can be highly attractive from those perspectives."

"Probing influence factors of implementation patterns for sustainable land consolidation: Insights from seventeen years of practice in Jiangsu province, China Land Consolidation; Agriculture; Cadastres Land consolidation is a key measure in the implementation of agricultural sustainability and has a strategic importance in farmland fragmentation reduction and rural revitalization. In order to understand spatiotemporal patterns of land consolidation implementation and their influences at a large scale, a comprehensive evaluation of 1046 land consolidation projects was conducted in Jiangsu Province, China. The results of this study showed that the construction scale (CS) and investment amount (IA) rose in waves in Jiangsu province during the period 2001-2017, while the newly increased farmland rate (NIFR) continued to decline. Spatial patterns of land consolidation aggregated, whereas the scale and the kernel density of the newly increased farmland area (NIFA) was differentiated in different time periods. In addition, the regional differentiation was significant. The gravity center of CS, IA, and NIFA moved with an overall trend from South Jiangsu to North Jiangsu, and finally stopped at the Li-Xia River plain area in North Jiangsu. The key factors that promoted land consolidation included natural farmland quality and the proportion of the primary industry production in GDP. The potential of NIFA, the farmland production amount, and the income of the financial transferring payment were also important factors. Spatial patterns were initially influenced by natural conditions and were later influenced more significantly by economic and policy conditions. In the future, differentiated land consolidation policy oriented by public involvement should be formulated to improve new frameworks of system implementation, as well as to provide evidence for spatial configuration, district cooperation, policy adjustment, and the systematic improvement of sustainable land consolidation."
"Exploring student engagement in fully flipped classroom pedagogy: Case of an Australian business undergraduate degree Classroom; Blended Learning; General Chemistry This paper aims to provide clear and appropriate evidence of factors that trigger student engagement of flipped classroom (FC) learning in higher education (HE), based on an example of a fully flipped business undergraduate degree program in Australia. Qualitative data from the Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units (SETU) of 142 first-year business students over seven consecutive trimesters (2017â€“2019) were gathered and analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings provide a nuanced understanding on triggers of student engagement in relation to self-efficacy, emotion, well-being and belonging. The findings may guide educators in full adoption of FC in other undergraduate courses."
"Social housing as infrastructure: An investment pathway Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Ensuring necessary and appropriate levels of social housing investment begins with a well-evidenced understanding of the scale, type and location of need and secondly, an accurate understanding of the cost of procuring appropriate dwellings in the right locations. The design of an investment pathway, and the use of public or private equity and debt, also significantly influences the cost to government and the wider community. Our research builds a customised method for establishing both current unmet need (the backlog) for social housing and future projected need, based on a proportionate share of expected future household growth. It also provides evidence for the diverse geography of land and construction costs based on industry and project level data. Five alternative pathways involving a range of debt, efficient financing and capital grant strategies have been modelled to assess their relative costs to government. The research shows the â€˜capital grantâ€™ model, supplemented by efficient financing, provides the most cost effective pathway for Australiaâ€”in preference to the â€˜no capital grant, commercial financing operating subsidyâ€™ model. Over the next 20 years, it has been estimated that 727,300 additional social dwellings will be required, with current price procurement costs varying from $146,000 to $614,000, depending on local land values, building types and construction costs in different regions. This report provides extensive data on needs and costs for 88 statistical areas (SA4 level). Where rents are set at levels affordable to low-income households, revenues can only support modest levels of debt financing and thus co-investment is also required. International experience on infrastructure investment pathways cautions that, while â€˜off balance sheetâ€™ Public Private Partnerships and Private Finance Initiatives (PPP/PFI) have been widely utilised in comparable countries (as well as in Australia), these have often proven sub-optimal in terms of cost efficiency and effectiveness (UK National Audit Office, 2018). This report provides inspiration from more productive, supply-orientated social housing systems that flourish in countries such as Scotland, Finland, France and Austria and most prominently amongst our Asian neighbours, China, Korea and Singapore."

"Matching symbiotic associations of an endangered orchid to habitat to improve conservation outcomes Germination; Tulasnella; Cephalanthera Background and Aims: An understanding of mycorrhizal variation, orchid seed germination temperature and the effect of co-occurring plant species could be critical for optimizing conservation translocations of endangered plants with specialized mycorrhizal associations. Methods: Focusing on the orchid Thelymitra epipactoides, we isolated mycorrhizal fungi from ten plants within each of three sites; Shallow Sands Woodland (SSW), Damp Heathland (DH) and Coastal Heathland Scrub (CHS). Twenty-seven fungal isolates were tested for symbiotic germination under three 24 h temperature cycles: 12 Â°C for 16 h-16 Â°C for 8 h, 16 Â°C for 16 h-24 Â°C for 8 h or 27 Â°C constant. Fungi were sequenced using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), nuclear large subunit 1 (nLSU1), nLSU2 and mitochondrial large rRNA gene (mtLSU). Orchids were grown to maturity and co-planted with each of ten associated plant species in a glasshouse experiment with tuber width measured at 12 months after co-planting. Key Results: Two Tulasnella fungal lineages were isolated and identified by phylogenetic analyses, operational taxonomic unit 1 (OTU1) and 'T. asymmetrica'. Fungal lineages were specific to sites and did not co-occur. OTU1 (from the SSW site) germinated seed predominantly at 12-16 Â°C (typical of autumn-winter temperature) whereas 'T. asymmetrica' (from the DH and CHS sites) germinated seed across all three temperature ranges. There was no difference in the growth of adult orchids germinated with different OTUs. There was a significant reduction in tuber size of T. epipactoides when co-planted with six of the commonly co-occurring plant species. Conclusions: We found that orchid fungal lineages and their germination temperature can change with habitat, and established that translocation sites can be optimized with knowledge of co-occurring plant interactions. For conservation translocations, particularly under a changing climate, we recommend that plants should be grown with mycorrhizal fungi tailored to the recipient site."

"Building capacity in monitoring urban liveability in bangkok: Critical success factors and reflections from a multi-sectoral, international partnership Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Cities are widely recognised as important settings for promoting health. Nonetheless, making cities more liveable and supportive of health and wellbeing remains a challenge. Decision-makersâ€™ capacity to use urban health evidence to create more liveable cities is fundamental to achieving these goals. This paper describes an international partnership designed to build capacity in using liveability indicators aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and social determinants of health, in Bangkok, Thailand. The aim of this paper is to reflect on this partnership and outline factors critical to its success. Partners included the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, the UN Global Compactâ€”Cities Programme, the Victorian Government Department of Health and Human Services, the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation, and urban scholars based at an Australian university. Numerous critical success factors were identified, including having a bilingual liaison and champion, establishment of two active working groups in the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, and incorporating a six-month hand-over period. Other successful outcomes included contextualising liveability for diverse contexts, providing opportunities for reciprocal learning and knowledge exchange, and informing a major Bangkok strategic urban planning initiative. Future partnerships should consider the strategies identified here to maximise the success and longevity of capacity-building partnerships."

"Effective dispatch strategies assortment according to the effect of the operation for an islanded hybrid microgrid Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems The optimized design of a freestanding hybrid microgrid for various distinct dispatch controls is assessed in this paper, which considers the optimal sizes of individual components, system response, and reliability analysis. The effective design and management of stand-alone islanded hybrid smartgrids are getting increasingly importance and influences as the prevalence of renewable energy in microgrids grows. Melville Island, off the coast of eastern Queensland, Australia, is taken as the test microgrid in this study. For the optimal sizing and techno-economic assessment of the intended hybrid microgrid system consist of of solar diesel generator, PV, battery storage, and wind turbine, four dispatch approaches have been unitized: load following, generator order, combined dispatch, and cycle charging strategy. The proposed off-grid microgrid's CO2 emissions, total net present cost (NPC), and the Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) have all been optimized. In HOMER software, all the possible dispatch algorithms were analyzed, and the power system responses and reliability study were carried out using DIgSILENT PowerFactory. The findings of the study are useful for determining the optimum hybrid combination and available resources for the best performance of an off-grid microgrid employing various dispatch mechanisms. Following the simulation data, load-following is the best dispatch mechanism for stand-alone microgrid architecture since it has the lowest LCOE and NPC."
"Identifying novel targets for treating the diseases of the brain: microglial metabolism as a treatment option To date, the focus of research into new treatments for the diseases of the brain has been primarily on neurons, the billions of cells that carry and integrate messages about our body and state-of-mind. However, there are currently no treatments that are capable of repairing or regenerating neurons when they are damaged. There is therefore a significant need for new approaches in drug discovery for brain repair. Microglia, the major brain immune cells, have been gaining increasing attention in recent decades. These cells play important roles not only in maintaining immune balance in the brain, but also in driving brain development, regulating appetite and memory. Recent evidence, including our own, suggests that when these microglial cells become dysfunctional, several brain-centred diseases are triggered or made worse. These diseases include common mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, as well as neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis, dementia, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. We propose that maintaining microglia at their optimal function is a promising strategy for maintaining brain health."
"Influence of pyrolysis parameters on phosphorus fractions of biosolids derived biochar Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Transforming biosolids into biochar, through pyrolysis, could result in more sustainable waste management. Influence of pyrolysis conditions (temperature, heating rate and residence time) on physico-chemical properties of biosolids (collected at Mount Martha Water Recycling Plant, Melbourne), phosphorus fractions and phosphorus forms was investigated. Twelve different biochar samples were produced at 400, 500 and 600 Â°C, at two heating rates (5 and 20 Â°C/min) and at two residence times (30 and 120 min). Biochar yield, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), elements (C, H and N) and BET surface area were analysed. Sequential extraction of P in biosolids and resultant biochars was done using Hedley method. Characterization was completed with SEM images and results from 31P liquid state NMR. Increased temperatures would not only increase the alkalinity, decrease EC and increase the adsorption capacity by increasing the surface area but also convert the readily available P to a less available pool. Therefore, this nutrient might be released to soil slowly over a longer period of time. The results showed that temperature, along with residence time and heating rate, had a significant effect on the characteristics observed. Therefore, all these factors need to be carefully considered when preparing biochar for use as a soil amendment."
"Strength and microstructural study of recycled asphalt pavement: Slag geopolymer as a pavement base material Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali The integrated transdisciplinary concepts and technologies for greener and more sustainable innovations for recycling waste materials through geopolymer technique into construction materials were developed in this research. The objective of this research was to study the strength and microstructural development of slag (S)-based geopolymer-stabilized recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) as a pavement base material. An attempt was made to study the influence of a liquid alkaline activator (L = NaOH=Na2SiO3 ratio) on the strength development of RAP-S geopolymers, which was evaluated by an unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test and examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. The XRD and SEM analyses results indicated that the main geopolymerization reaction product of RAP-S geopolymers was calcium alumino-silicate hydrate (C-A-S-H). Without Na2SiO3 (L = NaOH=Na2SiO3 = 100:0), the S-geopolymer exhibited a slow geopolymerization reaction. The silica presented in Na2SiO3 was highly soluble; hence, a suitable content of NaOH=Na2SiO3 = 60:40 can produce RAP+20%S geopolymers as a base material whose 7-day UCS value met the minimum strength requirements specified by the Department of Highways, Thailand. However, when excess Na2SiO3 content (NaOH=Na2SiO3 = 50:50) was used, the presence of silica retarded the geopolymerization formation rate, leading to UCS reduction. The outcomes of this research were found to be useful for making progress in innovative technologies and applications of geopolymers, which strongly reflected the improvements made in the practical applications of the S-geopolymer as a cleaner production by using the recycled waste material in road work."

According to the results, the French stock market is particularly sensitive to the environmental regulation embodied in the European Union Emissions Trading System and less so to the regulation on water, soil and air. The chemicals, oil and gas industries exhibit negative reactions, whereas other polluters (such as construction and materials, and industrial transportation) produce positive abnormal returns."
"Examining the relationship between urban liveability and gender-based violence: A systematic review. Alcohol Drinking; Underage Drinking; Neighborhood Characteristics Gender-based violence can include, but is not limited to, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, rape, and intimate partner homicide. It is well-established that gender inequality is the main driver of gender-based violence. However, little work has attempted to unpack how gender-based violence perpetuates within the neighbourhood context, and whether â€˜liveabilityâ€™ attributes might intersect with gender inequality and violence. We systematically reviewed quantitative evidence examining associations between gender-based violence and several liveability neighbourhood-level factors. MEDLINE (Ovid) and Scopus databases yielded 1822 potentially relevant articles. 50 articles met inclusion criteria. Neighbourhood social capital was most consistently associated with reduced gender-based violence. Few studies examined built environment attributes (e.g. gambling venue densities, access to services). Future research is needed to more deeply examine how combinations of salutogenic or pathogenic neighbourhood attributes may reinforce or prevent violence."
"A flexible closed loop supply chain design considering multi-stage manufacturing and queuing based inventory optimization Closed-Loop Supply Chain; Remanufacturing; Reverse Logistics In this study, a multi-objective nonlinear model is used to design a closed-loop supply chain network. We consider a multi-period, multi-product and multi-stage manufacturing model by employing a queuing system for inventory management of finished and return products under demand uncertainty limitations. The purpose of this paper is to simultaneously reduce the waiting times of queues in warehouses and the costs of production, transportation, inventory and queuing systems. The flexibility of the chain is formulated at three concepts: product flexibility, the flexibility of supply against demand fluctuations, and the flexibility of time to satisfy all demand. The proposed non-linear model is solved by a robust genetic algorithm. A sensitivity analysis of the flexibility ratios reveals several insights for practitioners and academics."

"The impact of ethnic diversity on microenterprise start-ups Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion Until recently, factors determining the decisions made by microfinance institutions (MFIs) to extend loans to business start-ups had not been explored. Recent evidence shows that MFI performance with regard to funds issued for small business start-ups depends on MFI-level characteristics such as profit orientation. We argue that these decisions do not only depend on MFI-specific practices or characteristics, but also on the role ethnic diversity plays. Using data on microfinance lending activities for business start-ups, we examine the impact of ethnic diversity on microenterprise start-ups. Results show that ethnic diversity negatively affects the provision of financial capital for business start-up. Furthermore, results also suggest a negative association between ethnic diversity and the share of female borrowers recorded by MFIs. We examine social networks and outreach as potential channels through which ethnic diversity affects business start-ups."

"Presence and characterization of microplastics in fish of commercial importance from the Biobío region in central Chile Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter In this study we have identified and characterized microplastic particles (MPs) found in six fish species of commercial importance in central Chile. The fish species belong to different trophic levels and were obtained from the oceanic and coastal habitats. To analyze MPs, the fish gastrointestinal content was extracted, analyzed and characterized using a microscopy equipped with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The MPs found in fish samples were mainly constituted by red microfibers (70â€“100%) with sizes ranging between 176 and 2842 Î¼m. Polyester, polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were identified as the prevalent polymers detected. The coastal species showed the presence of microfibers with a higher size and abundance (71%) compared to oceanic species (29%), suggesting there is a greater exposure risk. These findings are consistent with results found in other investigations worldwide. However, further research is still needed to accurately establish the potential exposure risk for the public consuming these fish and the impact of MPs in the Chilean fishery activities."

"Acoustic sensors for air and surface navigation applications Echolocation; Chiroptera; Hipposideros This paper presents the state-of-the-art and reviews the state-of-research of acoustic sensors used for a variety of navigation and guidance applications on air and surface vehicles. In particular, this paper focuses on echolocation, which is widely utilized in nature by certain mammals (e.g., cetaceans and bats). Although acoustic sensors have been extensively adopted in various engineering applications, their use in navigation and guidance systems is yet to be fully exploited. This technology has clear potential for applications in air and surface navigation/guidance for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), especially considering air and surface operations indoors and in other environments where satellite positioning is not available. Propagation of sound in the atmosphere is discussed in detail, with all potential attenuation sources taken into account. The errors introduced in echolocation measurements due to Doppler, multipath and atmospheric effects are discussed, and an uncertainty analysis method is presented for ranging error budget prediction in acoustic navigation applications. Considering the design challenges associated with monostatic and multi-static sensor implementations and looking at the performance predictions for different possible configurations, acoustic sensors show clear promises in navigation, proximity sensing, as well as obstacle detection and tracking. The integration of acoustic sensors in multi-sensor navigation systems is also considered towards the end of the paper and a low Size, Weight and Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) sensor integration architecture is presented for possible introduction in air and surface navigation systems."

"A modified novel blade configuration proposal for a more efficient VAWT using CFD tools Rotor; Solidity; Hydromechanics It is a priority to generate affordable and reliable energy with higher participation of renewable energy technologies into the global energy mix to provide efficient sustainable energy services for everyone, highlighting the need to focus on vulnerable communities in developing countries with limited or no access to electricity. Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) are widely used for renewable electricity generation. In that order, Savonius rotor, being a VAWT, is commonly used because of its numerous advantages for small scale generation. Thus, wind energy research on a modified Savonius rotor might be a feasible solution for powering vulnerable communities with no access to the grid. Hence, this paper shows how to improve the performance of a conventional Savonius blade by introducing a novel configuration without expensive and complex modifications on the geometry. For that purpose, a Cm and Cp coefficients comparison between 13 proposed scenarios against the conventional configuration to define a novel one, with better performance is carried out through a 2D computational fluid dynamic analysis by using Ansys Fluent 18.0. The SST k-Ï‰ model is selected as the turbulent model. As a result, a higher performance Savonius novel rotor configuration is identified with 17.81% improvement over the conventional configuration."
"Congruence of market orientation and organizational learning: Performance perspective Market Orientation; Marketing Capabilities; Innovation The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between market orientation, organizational learning and organizational performance. The study follows quantitative research strategy and cross-sectional survey design to collect data from manufacturing firms operating in Pakistan. Regression analysis and structural equation modeling techniques are used to analyze data. Results indicate that both market orientation and organizational learning significantly affect organizational performance. Additionally, customer orientation and inter-functional coordination are also positively related with all dimensions of organizational learning. Competitor orientation is significantly related with only knowledge interpretation dimension of organizational learning. This research explains how customer knowledge and competitor knowledge is instrumental towards an organization's learning behavior. This research is valuable to practitioners as they can learn how customer knowledge can provide them with multiple opportunities to create superior value. Similarly, competitor related knowledge is instrumental in drawing a competitive strategy to win customers. This paper is novel as it confirms market orientation as an antecedent of organizational learning. Furthermore, the paper explores significant implications of components of market orientation for organizational learning sub-processes."

"Self-Assembled Peptide Habitats to Model Tumor Metastasis Diphenylalanine; Peptide Nanotubes; Self-Assembly Metastatic tumours are complex ecosystems; a community of multiple cell types, including cancerous cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells that exist within a supportive and specific microenvironment. The interplay of these cells, together with tissue specific chemical, structural and temporal signals within a three-dimensional (3D) habitat, direct tumour cell behavior, a subtlety that can be easily lost in 2D tissue culture. Here, we investigate a significantly improved tool, consisting of a novel matrix of functionally programmed peptide sequences, self-assembled into a scaffold to enable the growth and the migration of multicellular lung tumour spheroids, as proof-of-concept. This 3D functional model aims to mimic the biological, chemical, and contextual cues of an in vivo tumor more closely than a typically used, unstructured hydrogel, allowing spatial and temporal activity modelling. This approach shows promise as a cancer model, enhancing current understandings of how tumours progress and spread over time within their microenvironment."

"Performance of precipitation and electrocoagulation as pretreatment of silica removal in brackish water and seawater Limestone; Polyaspartate; Water Cooling Systems Continuous increase in the world's population is posing serious threat to the fresh water reserves all over the world. Seawater desalination processes have been proven to be one of the most promising processes to supplement the increasing demand for fresh water, due to the limitless nature of seawater. One of the biggest problems related to the membrane desalination process is the fouling and scaling of reverse osmosis (RO) membrane. Among all the foulants, silica is considered to be one of the most difficult inorganic foulant to deal with in membrane desalination due to its chemical complexity. This study compares some of the most commonly used pretreatment techniques of silica removal, analyses the characteristics of dissolved silica in both brackish water and seawater bodies, along with silt density index (SDI) tests. It was found that silicate salts are difficult to be dissolved in brackish water and seawater, and the fouling propensity of membrane is not a function of silica concentration (from 15â€“200 mg/L) in the feed water. Also, Al3+ exhibited superior silica removal efficiency than Fe3+, and a removal efficiency of 90.2% was reported when using electrocoagulation on brackish water where the silica concentration was around 28 mg/L."

"Attitudinal support for violence against women: What a population-level survey of the Australian community can and cannot tell us Intimate Partner Violence; Violence Against Women; Domestic Violence Violence against women (VAW) is a serious and prevalent problem globally. Societal-level norms, practices and structures are among the factors contributing to it, sometimes referred to collectively as representing â€œcultures of supportâ€ for VAW. Understanding factors contributing to these cultures is important for prevention, but remains the subject of debate. Population-level surveys of attitudes toward VAW are one means to strengthen this understanding. Although there are a number of such surveys internationally, scholarly research based on secondary analysis of data, at least from surveys in high-income countries, is scant. This article reports on new analyses of the Australian National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women survey to explore its potential to further empirical and conceptual understanding of cultures of support for VAW. To facilitate this, a scale to measure attitudes toward VAW was developed post hoc from the survey (the Violence Supportive Attitudes, or VSA-18, Scale). Subsequent analyses investigate the relationship between this scale and relevant demographic factors and a measure of attitudinal support for gender equality (GE). The GE measure, place of birth, employment and occupation, generation, education and sex contribute to variance in the VSA-18 Scale. Findings are discussed in the context of theoretical debates and directions for future research."

"Nitrogen contamination and bioremediation in groundwater and the environment: A review Nitrate Pollution; Denitrification; Isotopes Nitrogen contamination of groundwater and the environment is an increasing problem in today's society. Since the invention of the Haber-Bosh process in 1913, the impacts of N on human health and the environment have become increasingly widespread due to the industrial scale production of reactive N (Nr). As a result, government organisations and the scientific community continue to make advances towards tackling this ongoing problem. The inherent difficulties of accessing, observing and monitoring groundwater, combined with the complexity of interactions between groundwater chemistry, hydrogeology and ecology have resulted in gaps in fundamental knowledge, specifically regarding the understanding and remediation of N contaminated groundwater. As these knowledge gaps are addressed with ongoing research, current and future remediation targets are being consistently updated; this has resulted in past remediation strategies that may no longer be consistent in meeting new regulatory guidelines for water quality. As such, the search for more technically and economically feasible remediation strategies continues. Recent advances in bioremediation technologies have opened up promising avenues for research in the remediation of N contaminated groundwater. This literature review outlines the past, present and future of Nr-contamination and remediation in Nr -contaminated groundwater within the broader context of the larger environment. The literature cited in this review is critically evaluated to determine significant knowledge gaps."
"What cost-effective built environment interventions would create healthy, liveable and equitable communities in Australia? The built environment and health is a relatively new, but rapidly growing field of research. In the last decade, there has been a plethora of top tier health, exercise science and urban planning journals publishing special issues on this topic including: American Journal of Public Health (2003), American Journal of Health Promotion (2003 and 2007), American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2005, 2007-2009), the Journal of the American Planning Association (2006), Journal of Adolescent Health (2009), Journal of Physical Activity and Health (2011), Health and Place (2012), Preventive Medicine (2008), Journal of Public Health Policy (2009), and Annals of Behavioral Medicine (2013) (to name a few). 
Since 2003, 7 US journals publishing special issues on the BE and health have included my1-4 or my students 5-8 papers; leading journals in my field have requested reviews on future research directions or an editorial; and editors across four fields have requested book chapters ie, health; sustainability; geography; landscape architecture. My research examines the impact of the built environment on a range of health and wellbeing outcomes including walking, cycling, obesity, mental health, social capital, dog walking and more recently, cardiovascular disease."

"Nano-plastics and their analytical characterisation and fate in the marine environment: From source to sea Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Polymer contamination is a major pollutant in all waterways and a significant concern of the 21st Century, gaining extensive research, media, and public attention. The polymer pollution problem is so vast; plastics are now observed in some of the Earth's most remote regions such as the Mariana trench. These polymers enter the waterways, migrate, breakdown; albeit slowly, and then interact with the environment and the surrounding biodiversity. It is these biodiversity and ecosystem interactions that are causing the most nervousness, where health researchers have demonstrated that plastics have entered the human food chain, also showing that plastics are damaging organisms, animals, and plants. Many researchers have focused on reviewing the macro and micro-forms of these polymer contaminants, demonstrating a lack of scientific data and also a lack of investigation regarding nano-sized polymers. It is these nano-polymers that have the greatest potential to cause the most harm to our oceans, waterways, and wildlife. This review has been especially ruthless in discussing nano-sized polymers, their ability to interact with organisms, and the potential for these nano-polymers to cause environmental damage in the marine environment. This review details the breakdown of macro-, micro-, and nano-polymer contamination, examining the sources, the interactions, and the fates of all of these polymer sizes in the environment. The main focus of this review is to perform a comprehensive examination of the literature of the interaction of nanoplastics with organisms, soils, and waters; followed by the discussion of toxicological issues. A significant focus of the review is also on current analytical characterisation techniques for nanoplastics, which will enable researchers to develop protocols for nanopolymer analysis and enhance understanding of nanoplastics in the marine environment."

"Patterns of tree removal and canopy change on public and private land in the City of Melbourne Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Many cities face a struggle to reconcile ambitious tree canopy cover targets with urban development pressures. Canopy cover in The City of Melbourne, Australia, which has a target of 40 % canopy cover on public land by 2040, was analysed together with individual tree removal data, with particular focus on how many street trees were removed near major development sites between 2008 and 2017. We observed major gains and losses of canopy, resulting in small net changes. Our analyses showed a net gain in tree canopy cover in public streets and a net loss of canopy cover in public parks and private properties. The most frequently removed trees in both public parks and streets were small (<15 cm stem diameter). In contrast, more large, exotic trees were removed from public parks than public streetscapes. These large park trees represented a small proportion of total tree removals, but had larger stem basal areas and therefore large canopies. From 2008 to 2017, almost 2000 street trees were removed within 10 m of major development sites, equivalent to almost 20 % of all street trees removed in that time period, but this constituted only 8% of streetscape tree canopy cover losses. These findings suggest that in The City of Melbourne, mature tree succession and removal in parks has the greatest potential to hinder the achievement of canopy cover targets. Canopy cover gains could be maximised through improvements in the establishment and survival of replacement trees in both parks and streetscapes. The protection of the existing urban forest, through policy and practice, will also be critical for the retention and enhancement of tree canopy cover."
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Sustainable Institutional Food Systems: Implementation of AI Tools for School Nutrition Program Management in the United States of America Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems School food programs can improve the nutritional status at community level, and can be a powerful tool to facilitate a transition to sustainable food systems, particularly through their purchasing methods and meal/waste management. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enable or inhibit transitions to sustainability, due to its capacity to facilitate transformational change and disruption. Thus, AI can have major impacts on achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including those related to food systems. This paper focuses on critically exploring different aspects during the implementation of a software project in US schools that used AI techniques to enable agility and provide healthy food options for schoolchildren. Participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis were used to inform the case study and uncover the new processes developed using the technology. As a key barrier to the effective management of school food programs and nutrition is the administrative load associated with statutory compliance, this case study demonstrates the difference that AI-powered tools can make in alleviating the weight of administrative processes. An Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-enabled boundary spanning framework is used to extend the case study toward an analysis of the systems, boundaries, relationships and perspectives which starts mapping the areas where the private sector, public institutions and civil society can meet to fast-track sustainable transition activities, particularly in the context of food systems. This article presents some possible approaches to facilitating these activities, inviting policy makers to bridge the gap with businesses and use business agility to support common societal goals to achieve sustainable food systems."
"Financialization and income inequality: An extreme bounds analysis Financialization; Household Debt; Capitalism Several theoretical hypotheses predict conflicting effects of financialization on income inequality, and the lack of consensus is reinforced by the mixed findings of related empirical studies. In this paper we address the model uncertainty issue by applying extreme bounds analysis (EBA) to examine the robustness of financialization variables as determinants of income inequality. The results suggest that financialization is a leading driver of income inequality and that the effects are larger when transmitted through financial markets. In addition, the results show that law and order, labour union density, population, globalization, remittances, education, and the agriculture sector share are also robust determinants of income inequality. Policy recommendations are put forward to reduce the power of the financial sector."

"The “Gender Agenda” in Agriculture for Development and Its (Lack of) Alignment With Feminist Scholarship Farmers; Women in Agriculture; Farm Families Sustainable food systems require sustainable agriculture. To achieve this, we argue, inclusive approaches are required that incorporate the voices and lived experiences of diverse social groups. In agriculture-based international development efforts (known as Agriculture for Development or A4D), it is increasingly being recognized that sustainable agriculture requires attention to gendered power relations. In the past, gender inequality has been a major barrier to developing inclusive, sustainable food systems, and continues to be so today. At the same time, however, gender is increasingly â€œon the agendaâ€ in A4D. Yet what sort of agenda is being promoted and to what extent does it reflect progress in feminist scholarship? We examine the burgeoning â€œgender agendaâ€ through the lens of policy materials produced by prominent A4D organizations. In doing so, we find problematic narratives that instrumentalise women in the name of sustainable agricultural development. However, we also find other more transformative discourses that, in troubling the drivers of gender inequality and promoting shared responsibility for change, reflect a deeper awareness of feminist scholarship. In any effort to advance sustainable agriculture, further progress is needed to address the myriad ways gender pervades not just development settings but development institutions and donor nations, and contributes to the production of as well as responses to global A4D challenges."

"Understanding challenges to diversity in the music industry in a time of crisis Despite the many advances made in gender equality in Australian society, women are still extremely under-represented in the music industry. For example, only one in five APRA AMCOS members identifies as female, and surveys of festival and gig line-ups have
revealed the overwhelming dominance of cis white males on stages. This problem is wellrecognised and significant work has been undertaken over the last five years on all levels of the industry to better understand and remedy this situation. This work has extended to
various programs designed to improve representation of many other previously marginalised groups in the industry.
Any progress made during this time is, however, at risk of being lost because of the COVID-19 crisis. During the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, research showed that in the creative industries women were more likely to be laid off or lose work. Studies have shown that in
times of crisis creative workers’ more risk-averse working patterns include retreating to trusted networks of collaborators which, while understandable, has gendered outcomes, as one of the most frequently cited reasons for women (and others) being disadvantaged in
these industries is the exclusionary nature of such networks.
This proposed research project is designed to provide a snapshot of the changes taking place as the industry adjusts to the crisis, and begins to make plans for rebuilding. The information gathered by the proposed project will be of vital importance if the industry is to
retain the focus on inclusivity that has emerged in recent years. "

"Sustainability and depth of outreach: Evidence from microfinance institutions in sub-Saharan Africa Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion The feasibility of microfinance institutions (MFIs) to expand outreach to the poorest while remaining financially sustainable has long been debated. Using data from 206 MFIs in 33 African countries, we adopt the three-stage least square technique to assess whether a trade-off exists between sustainability and outreach depth. Our results confirm the existence of a trade-off. The evidence also supports ongoing subsidies for MFIs with the aim of encouraging outreach. In addition, we examine whether there is an inflection point beyond which higher interest rates reduce profitability for MFIs. We find no evidence of a threshold beyond which profitability is reduced."
"Identifying future health professionals’ understanding of the determinants of health Qualitative Research; Visual Methods; Community-Based Participatory Research Background: An understanding of the determinants of health is essential for all health professionals to be able to contribute to health promotion and disease prevention. Method: This project sought to explore first-year studentsâ€™ understanding of determinants of health through a photograph essay assessment. Results: Approximately one third of the students chose to depict social determinants of health, such as poverty and homelessness. Other determinants, such as individual human behavior, physical determinants, and policy, were less frequently selected. Content analysis of the studentsâ€™ photograph essay indicated two themes regarding approaches they believed could be used to improve equityâ€” Education, and The Role of the Government. Conclusion: Given the expectations of health professionals to contribute to health promotion and disease prevention in their communities, the findings from this study provide evidence for the need to develop new teaching and learning strategies to more effectively prepare health professional students for the future."

"Individual and Group-wise Classroom Seating Experience: Effects on Student Engagement in Different Courses Student-teacher Relationships; Student Engagement; Academic Achievement Seating location in the classroom can affect student engagement, attention and academic performance by providing better visibility, improved movement, and participation in discussions. Existing studies typically explore how traditional seating arrangements (e.g. grouped tables or traditional rows) influence students' perceived engagement, without considering group seating behaviours under more flexible seating arrangements. Furthermore, survey-based measures of student engagement are prone to subjectivity and various response bias. Therefore, in this research, we investigate how individual and group-wise classroom seating experiences affect student engagement using wearable physiological sensors. We conducted a field study at a high school and collected survey and wearable data from 23 students in 10 courses over four weeks. We aim to answer the following research questions: 1. How does the seating proximity between students relate to their perceived learning engagement? 2. How do students' group seating behaviours relate to their physiologically-based measures of engagement (i.e. physiological arousal and physiological synchrony)? Experiment results indicate that the individual and group-wise classroom seating experience is associated with perceived student engagement and physiologically-based engagement measured from electrodermal activity. We also find that students who sit close together are more likely to have similar learning engagement and tend to have high physiological synchrony. This research opens up opportunities to explore the implications of flexible seating arrangements and has great potential to maximize student engagement by suggesting intelligent seating choices in the future."
"Object-based random forest classification for informal settlements identification in the Middle East: Jeddah a case study Remote Sensing Image; Image Analysis; Land Cover The identification of informal settlements in urban areas is an important step in developing and implementing pro-poor urban policies. Understanding when, where and who lives inside informal settlements is critical in efforts to improve their resilience. This study aims to analyse the capability of machine-learning (ML) methods to map informal settlement areas in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, using very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery and terrain data. Fourteen indicators of settlement characteristics were derived and mapped using an object-based ML approach and VHR imagery. These indicators were categorized according to three different spatial levels: environ, settlement and object. The most useful indicators for prediction were found to be density and texture measures, (with random forest (RF) relative importance measures of over 25% and 23% respectively). The success of this approach was evaluated using a small, fully independent validation dataset. Informal areas were mapped with an overall accuracy of 91%. Object-based ML as a processing chain approach performed better (8%) than object-based image analysis alone due to its ability to encompass all available geospatial levels."

"Assessment Design for Interdisciplinary, Professional and Sustainability Education Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development This paper offers a situated micro-analysis of a major undergraduate assessment task within Sustainability Education, which exemplifies earlier work on the Higher Education Learning Design framework (HELD) as discussed in Holdsworth and Hegarty (J Clean Prod 122:176â€“185, 2016) and Hegarty and Holdsworth (Environ Dev Sustain 17:239â€“258, 2015). This assessment task, undertaken by students in multiple baccalaureate programs whose professional terrain is directly connectedâ€”that of construction managers, building developers and the urban planners who evaluate and approve development proposals in municipal and consultancy contexts. This paper presents the rationale for the assessment inception and design in the context of various imperatives. It also explores the situated experience of delivery of this assessment and our own reflection on the management of a complex assessment task. Student perspectives from the courses are also shared, drawing on external research undertaken on the learning and teaching experiences within both courses when the assessment was first implemented. Useful lessons for integrated, student-centred learning design, as proposed by the HELD model, are highlighted from this micro-analysis."

Old and Appreciated: Exploring the Influence of Material Ageing on the Aesthetic Appreciation of Everyday Products Materials Selection; Multicriteria Decision-making; Decision Making There is a growing interest in design research to explore sustainable consumption via products that are cherished as they age. This paper presents an empirical study exploring the influence of patina (signs of surface aging) on consumers' willingness to discard products and aesthetic appreciation. Results show participants are predisposed to discard everyday products regardless aesthetic qualities (patina). This implies designers should look beyond the presence of pure aesthetic qualities of aging and emphasise symbolic qualities of aging to stimulate appreciation as products age.

"Energy poverty, temperature and climate change Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort We examine the effect of temperature shocks on the proclivity to be in energy poverty and combine our estimates with simulated weather data to predict the effect of global warming on the incidence of energy poverty over the rest of the century. To do so, we match representative household panel data for Australia with weather data at a geographically localized level. We find that each additional â€˜cold dayâ€™ (average temperature below 15 Â°C) increases the incidence of energy poverty by 0.01%â€“0.03%, compared to if the day had been in the comfortable temperature range (20-24 Â°C). We find that global warming can be expected to result in modest decreases in the extent of energy poverty in the short-medium and long-run. Most studies have emphasized the economic and social costs of climate change. Our findings are important in pointing to a specific outcome for which climate change may be beneficial for a large country with a relatively mild climate."
"Collective Energy Security, Economic Prosperity and Mitigation of Climate Change in South Asia Ganges River; Bangladesh; Road Traffic Noise Affordable access to energy and power is vital for economic and human development, industrialization, and poverty alleviation. Over 20% of South Asia's population does not have access to power, resulting in immense economic growth and prosperity deprivation. The limited endowment of locally available energy resources; varied financial and technological capabilities among South Asian nations greatly restrict their efficient and sustainable power generation and utilization capacity. Containment of energy resources, mismatch of power generation, and user locations due to cross-border non-collaboration have created inefficient uses of limited locally available energy and power. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to review current power generation capacities, available energy resources (conventional and renewable), potential cross-border collaboration in power trade and exchange, and collective investment in sustainable power generation in South Asian nations."
Public communication and hydrogen as a fuel in Australia (Future Fuels CRC) Hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels are on the cusp of becoming a reality for Australian energy consumers. Pilot projects will see production technologies installed near or close to residential areas across Australia. Industry requires timely data about actual patterns of social communication enacted between citizens and industry across the low carbon fuel space in order create and execute policy solutions to support the adoption of low carbon fuels. The proposed research is unique across the future fuels space. No other research has yet studied the situated communicative behaviour of stakeholders in this part of the energy sector.
"A parsimonious approach to mapping climate-change-related composite disaster risk at the local scale in coastal Bangladesh Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Climate-change-induced disaster risks impede sustainable development goals in many developing countries. With the prevailing climate change conditions, environmental events are likely to become even more pervasive. Coastal regions, the source of numerous tangible and intangible benefits for human populations, are exposed to a wide range of risks. With the motivation that knowledge of risk at local levels could bring substantial benefits for risk reduction planning, the current study devised a framework for mapping composite disaster risk at the local scale using context-specific risk variables and tested it within a clearly defined coastal sub-district of southwestern Bangladesh. Utilizing easily accessible spatial and non-spatial secondary datasets, a risk map for the study area was formulated using geospatial techniques. The map revealed that within a small area of about 230 km2, the disaster risk varied considerably, which is attributable to the variability of geographic and socio-demographic features of the area. The map delineated 21% of the study area as very high risk, 20% as high, 21% as moderate, 20% as low, and 18% as very low risk. The technique for risk mapping adopted in this study is inexpensive to conduct, doable within a brief period, requires limited data inputs and is thus useable for countries like Bangladesh that have a dearth of data. The resulting map is an improvement over existing risk maps, which are currently available only at the regional scale, and hence provides a robust platform upon which to commence the process of disaster risk reduction in the area."

"DIRECT, a tool for change: Co-designing resource efficiency in the food supply chain Food Loss; Waste Prevention; Community Participation The problem of food waste has captured global attention in recent times. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) estimates that around one-third of the edible parts of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally; equivalent to 1.3 billion ton each year. This paper investigates a newly developed tool to help support better resource management for food manufacturers in dealing with the food waste issues. Our primary contribution lies in our dissection of the participatory nature of the tool development i.e. how do we engage the industries involved for the best social, environmental and economic outcomes? We use a case study method, drawing on data deriving from the various food manufacturing organisations and research partners involved in the development and use of the Dynamic Industry Resource Efficiency Calculation Tool (DIRECT). Through this approach a deep understanding of people and processes involved with the tool development is established, by a â€˜triangulationâ€™ of multiple data from a number of project contexts to develop our insights. We conclude by revealing the establishment of new food manufacturing projects for DIRECT, in terms of what the recent commissioners of said projects identify as the value the tool and process provide, and what that might mean for better food waste outcomes in the future. This validates utilising a co-design approach demonstrated in our paper, and justifies further research into broadening the adoption of such methods in addressing food waste."
"Longitudinal associations between bicycling and having dependent children, in middle-aged men and women Bicycling; Bike; Cyclist Bicycling has multiple health benefits. Child-rearing may influence bicycling, but little is known about the impact of this between men's and women's bicycling, or of number and ages of children on bicycling. This study examined the longitudinal associations between having dependent children and bicycling for transportation and recreation over 4 years among mid-aged men and women. Data were from the HABITAT study (Australia). We analysed data from three survey waves (2007, 2009, 2011) using multilevel logistic regression stratified by gender (n = 7758). Findings indicate that having dependent children was associated with bicycling for transportation and recreation in contrasting ways for men and women. The odds of bicycling were higher in men with â‰¥2 children aged under 18y than men without children (transportation: OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.98; recreation: OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.67, 3.37). Over time, the odds of recreational bicycling were lower in women with â‰¥2 children than women without children (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.93). However, for both men and women, the odds of recreational bicycling were higher in those with children aged 6â€“12y than those with younger or older children (men: OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.39, 2.49; women: OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.31, 2.46). Interventions to promote bicycling must therefore consider gendered differences in bicycling for travel and active leisure, and family circumstances. An opportunity to promote bicycling might be to target parents with children aged 6â€“12y."
"An experiment on the efficiency of bilateral exchange under incomplete markets Experimental Asset Markets; Bubble; Price Bubbles We test in a controlled laboratory environment whether traders in a bilateral exchange internalize the impact of their actions on market prices better than in a large market. In this model, traders choose asset holdings, constrained by a technology frontier. Next, each trader experiences a random shock which makes only one type of asset profitable. In a general equilibrium environment with incomplete markets, this leads to pecuniary externalities because traders increase scarce asset holdings beyond what is socially optimal. This behavior is especially exacerbated in large experimental markets as traders fail to internalize the impact of their actions on prices. We find that when markets are incomplete, a bilateral exchange can slightly mitigate the extent of pecuniary externalities, and weakly increase welfare."
"If not quality, then what? The discursive risks in early childhood quality reform Early Childhood Education and Care; Nursery Schools; Preschool Education This paper reports on the findings of a genealogical study and argues that the global discourse of quality in early childhood education and care (ECEC) is based on a number of problematic assumptions that converge to identify â€˜qualityâ€™ as the site of government investment. Using the Australian policy context as an example, the assumption that only quality ECEC is beneficial for children is linked to the historical privileging of mother-care and the male breadwinner through family policy. Using Foucaultâ€™s notion of the â€˜art of governmentâ€™, the implications of the discursive logics of quality are outlined, including how â€˜not qualityâ€™ childcare is positioned as potentially harmful, yet, the workforce can never be â€˜quality enoughâ€™. It is recommended that early childhood sector academics, advocates and professionals work to introduce new discursive statements to the global policyscape, in order to create and foster diverse representations and understandings of the benefits and value of ECEC."

"Efficient Robust Model Fitting for Multistructure Data Using Global Greedy Search Fundamental Matrix; Inliers (Landforms); Point In this paper, a new robust model fitting method is proposed to efficiently segment multistructure data even when they are heavily contaminated by outliers. The proposed method is composed of three steps: first, a conventional greedy search strategy is employed to generate (initial) model hypotheses based on the sequential 'fit-and-remove' procedure because of its computational efficiency. Second, to efficiently generate accurate model hypotheses close to the true models, a novel global greedy search strategy initially samples from the inliers of the obtained model hypotheses and samples subsequent data subsets from the whole input data. Third, mutual information theory is applied to fuse the model hypotheses of the same model instance. The conventional greedy search strategy is used to generate model hypotheses for the remaining model instances, if the number of retained model hypotheses is less than that of the true model instances after fusion. The second and the third steps are performed iteratively until an adequate solution is obtained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method for model fitting."
Controlling arsenic to unlock value in gold and copper resources The aim of this project is to characterise the transformation of arsenic between oxidation states during mineral processing. This will enable the development of process technology that immobilises and removes arsenic at the earliest possible stage. The use of novel time-resolved in-situ techniques proposed in this research will give vital information of the complex chemical pathways involved during processing which current characterization methods on pre- and post-processed species do not.
"Predicting separation selectivity of porous materials for CO2 capture Dr Ravichandar Babarao is an ARC DECRA fellow of RMIT who joined the university recently from CSIRO. Dr Babarao developed significant expertise while in CSIRO in modelling of porous materials for various functional uses. On joining RMIT, Dr Babarao and RMIT entered into a Visiting Scientist agreement and collaboration agreement to cover his ongoing general collaboration with CSIRO. Under that agreement, the potential for CSIRO to subcontract Dr Babarao through RMIT for commercial work was identified, as was the need for those contracts to be handled according to their own specific conditions especially WRT IP given the needs of the commercial contracts. The existing Visitors and Collaboration agreement is attached for reference (TRIM CON 2016/02823).

This project has arisen as a result of that need, reflecting a requirement for CSIRO to access Dr Babarao¿s expertise as
a subcontractor to a particular project with CSIRO.

The project involves mathematical modelling to screen porous materials for their capacity to selectively capture CO2.
CSIRO will specify the materials to be screened and conditions, and Dr Babarao will conduct research to identify priority targets."

"Heatwaves, cooling and young children at home: Integrating energy and health objectives Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort This paper examines the practices advised by health authorities and performed by parents to cool infants during hot weather. The aim is to explore how health and energy efficiency imperatives can be better integrated for households. Consumption of home air conditioning is increasing around the world alongside policy concerns about energy poverty, climate change and peak demand. This paper analyses online sources containing advice to parents about temperature, hot weather and infant health. The content of this â€˜know-whatâ€™ for parents was considered alongside experience-based â€˜know-howâ€™ (Royston, 2014) as described by parents in 44 interviews and home tours in Australia. Air conditioning is frequently positioned by health authorities as superior to low or no energy practices. However, understandings of infant care during hot weather are diverse and unsettled âˆ’ both amongst parents and authorities. The absence of health sector consensus leaves space for energy policymakers to engage with the health sector to develop integrated cross-sectoral policy approaches. Continued circulation of adaptive, less energy-intensive hot weather practices is needed. Arresting the trajectory towards widespread reliance on air conditioning can help household finances, reduce electricity demand during hot weather, and avoid leaving parents ill-equipped when high demand or unexpected events compromise electricity supply."

"Hybrid Color Filters for Multispectral Imaging Color Printing; Metals; Counterfeiting Multispectral cameras capture images in multiple wavelengths in narrow spectral bands. They offer advanced sensing well beyond normal cameras and many single-sensor-based multispectral cameras are commercialized aimed at a broad range of applications, such as agroforestry research, medical analysis, and so on. However, the existing single-sensor-based multispectral cameras require accurate alignment to overlay each filter on image sensor pixels, which makes their fabrication very complex, especially when the number of bands is large. This paper demonstrates a new filter technology using a hybrid combination of single plasmonic layer and dielectric layers by computational simulations. A filter mosaic of various bands with narrow spectral width can be achieved with single run manufacturing processes (i.e., exposure, development, deposition, and other minor steps) regardless of the number of bands."

"Diversity of online behaviours associated with physical attendance in lectures Online Courses; Mooc; Blended Learning A common use of technology in higher education is the provision of online course materials, invoking an investigation of the ways in which students engage with online course content, and how their participation changes over time. This is particularly necessary in the context of high absenteeism from lectures, where online access may be the only way in which particular students are engaging with the course. In this study, we examine large-scale patterns of attendance in class, as well as four types of access to online materials. We define two online behavioural metrics â€” richness and evenness â€” to capture the distribution of online behaviours within 255 courses, and examine how these change over time. We find that both physical and online attendance decrease throughout the semester, but the fraction of students present online is considerably higher than the fraction present in lectures. Students adapt their online behaviour, and rare behaviours disappear over time. It is important to consider how we provide content, both face-to-face and online, in order to ensure that as many students as possible are accessing this content in ways that we intend."

"Integrated inclusion: developing best practice for engineering education and the profession As identified in the ACED Engineering Futures 2035 Scoping Study, to tackle the biggest challenges the engineering profession of the future needs to reflect the diverse make up of Australian society. One cause for the lack of diversity is that under-represented groups do not feel a sense of inclusion or belonging in their engineering studies/profession. Current university inclusion initiatives tend to focus on attracting a target minority and have largely had limited success. Classroom inclusion initiatives, disconnected from the course content, are often perceived as simplistic or tokenistic, placing the burden on the minority to modify their behaviour. This research project will develop education best practice where the successful participation and inclusion of marginalised and disadvantaged students is
integrated into the course itself, comparable to how teamwork is often integrated in engineering courses. Validation will occur in a 3,000-student cohort across three universities. Dissemination will target engineering educators of first year courses where belonging is critical."

"From green spaces to vital places: connection and expression in urban greening Greenspace; Green Infrastructure; National Parks Urban greening, the improvement or increase of green spaces in cities, has purported environmental, individual, social and cultural benefits. The extent and qualities of urban green spaces, and our opportunities to engage with them, reflect and shape human responses to those spaces. Planning scholars recognise the traditional role and obligation of planning to help reduce social problems and see the potential for the public to be leaders in defining responses. However, use of technical, scientific and economic approaches by urban land managers can limit recognition of diverse connections to urban green and advance narrow conceptions of nature. We sample peopleâ€™s responses to different forms of urban green and greening in three case studies from Melbourne, Australia. We show that modern connections and expressions are personal, social and dynamic. Human experiences are embedded in nature and connections develop from interactions with and about nature, in formal and informal spaces. Diverse connections prompt responses to nature, and actions affecting nature itself. Accordingly, we propose ways to develop more receptive, responsive, inclusive and connected forms of urban greening. These include recognising diverse connections and expressions, encouraging dynamic relationships with nature, and providing varied ways of engaging with urban green spaces that foster stewardship."

"Estimation of environmental emissions and impacts of building construction – A decision making tool for contractors Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Building construction sites are responsible for significant energy consumption and emission production. The emissions at building construction stage vary from greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxides (CO2) to non-GHG emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) and sulphur dioxides (SO2). The construction emissions are often neglected due to the low amounts of emissions compared to high use phase emissions over the building life cycle. However studies have shown that these impacts from building construction can be significant at national and local level. Several difficulties and complications in estimation have restrained the possibility of effective decision making to minimise these emissions. Stakeholders in the construction industry seek the necessity of an emission calculation tool that enables the decision making in construction related emissions with minimum effort. The Construction Emission Evaluation Tool (CEET) presented in the study allows designers and contractors to estimate and compare emissions from the major emission sources in building construction. Emission analyses at project, equipment and activity levels provide in-depth scrutiny of emissions in minimising emissions and assisting the decision making for effective resource planning. Foundation construction corresponding to a case study is presented to demonstrate the functions and the capabilities of the developed calculation tool. The tool can provide a strong basis for the construction industry stakeholders and related researchers to make better decisions in maintaining a sustainable work environment. The study is also the initial step towards developing a sustainable decision making tool that can optimise cost, emissions and other construction related issues."

"The Role of Cultural Heritage in Promoting Urban Sustainability: A Brief Review Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems Cities are hubs of social and cultural activity, and culture is key to what makes cities creative, and sustainable. The Post-2015 Development Agenda has prioritized culture and how it may help people and communities create the future they desire. The study aims to determine the link between cultural heritage and urban sustainability and how multidisciplinary education can help organize urban issues. The article is of relevance to the emerging multicultural urban society with wide socio-economic disparities straining the global urban resilience and posing a challenge for future policy implementation. A systematic literature review was conducted using the Dimension database, and the results were analyzed using VOS viewer. The study also employed the PRISMA quantitative approach for selection criteria. This paper has identified understudied themes including community heritage, sustainable urban governance, and behavioral and multidisciplinary approaches. It is strongly felt that undertaking this study will not only add to the literature in cultural heritage study but also help further multidisciplinary and knowledge-based inquiry, which is currently evolving in the academic domain. Therefore, urban academics have a duty to resolve the issue confronting global urban sustainability and cultural disputes. Future research is required to simplify the current complex issue to make it more relevant and inclusive."

"Study on the critical factors and hot spots of crude oil tanker accidents Collision Avoidance; Waterways; Vessel The safety of crude oil tankers is always a focus under the rapid development of oil trade and maritime transportation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the critical factors that lead to crew casualties and address the hot spot distribution characteristics by reviewing accident data over the last 26 years. A Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) regression model is introduced to evaluate the extent of eight selected factors on crew mortality. Three others regression models (Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Zero-Inflated Poisson regression model) are chosen for model comparison to demonstrate the superiority of the ZINB model. The results showed that the ZINB model outperforms the other regression models in terms of fitting performance. The leading contributors of the crude oil tanker accident casualties were found as foundered and fire/explosion, followed by war loss/hostilities, collision, weather conditions, classification society, hull/machinery damage, and ship size. Furthermore, the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) methodology is adopted to identify hot spots and their trend evolution features of critical accident factors. Crude oil tanker accidents were observed more likely to occur in the waters around the United Kingdom, Gulf of Mexico, Strait of Malacca & Singapore Strait, Mediterranean Sea, China, Japan & Korea, and the Gulf Area, which may be due to the dense shipping routes, poor geographical conditions, and adverse weather conditions. The results of this study provide conducive suggestions for those policy-makers to develop appropriate and effective strategies for preventing crude oil tanker accidents."
"Climate change impacts on pollutants mobilization and interactive effects of climate change and pollutants on toxicity and bioaccumulation of pollutants in estuarine and marine biota and linkage to seafood security Climate Change; Sea Urchins; Acanthochromis Polyacanthus This article provides an overview of the impacts of climate change stressors (temperature, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and hypoxia) on estuarine and marine biota (algae, crustaceans, molluscs, corals, and fish). It also assessed possible/likely interactive impacts (combined impacts of climate change stressors and pollutants) on pollutants mobilization, pollutants toxicity (effects on growth, reproduction, mortality) and pollutants bioaccumulation in estuarine and marine biota. An increase in temperature and extreme events may enhance the release, degradation, transportation, and mobilization of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic pollutants in the estuarine and marine environments. Based on the available pollutants' toxicity trend data and information it reveals that the toxicity of several high-risk pollutants may increase with increasing levels of climate change stressors. It is likely that the interactive effects of climate change and pollutants may enhance the bioaccumulation of pollutants in seafood organisms. There is a paucity of literature relating to realistic interactive effects of climate change and pollutants. Therefore, future research should be directed towards the combined effects of climate change stressors and pollutants on estuarine and marine bota. A sustainable solution for pollution control caused by both greenhouse gas emissions (that cause climate change) and chemical pollutants would be required to safeguard the estuarine and marine biota."
"Are fire services ‘extremely gendered’ organizations? Examining the Country Fire Authority (CFA) in Australia Wildfires; Wildland-Urban Interface; Disaster Emergency management organizations often have military-based histories and continue to maintain militaristic styles of operation. Similar to the military, these organizations tend to be male dominated and culturally masculinized. The militarization and masculinization of rural fire services in Australia are generally unrecognized but highly important elements defining these organizations, and the example of the Country Fire Authority (CFA) is considered here. Using a cultural artefacts approach, historical and contemporary elements of the CFA's structure and practice are analysed using the concept of an â€˜extremely genderedâ€™ organization, with a focus on how the CFA is structurally and culturally gendered. We argue there is value in expanding the notion of â€˜extremely genderedâ€™ institutions beyond the military, to include other militarized organizations. Doing so not only helps to better understand and address resistance to change and gender equality measures, it also draws attention to the important role that such organizations play in the greater patriarchal order."

"Subjective Metrics-Based Cloud Market Performance Prediction Social Media; Online Reviews; Brand Community This paper explores an effective machine learning approach to predict cloud market performance for cloud consumers, providers and investors based on social media. We identified a set of comprehensive subjective metrics that may affect cloud market performance via literature survey. We used a popular sentiment analysis technique to process customer reviews collected from social media. Cloud market revenue growth was selected as an indicator of cloud market performance. We considered the revenue growth of Amazon Web Services as the stakeholder of our experiments. Three machine learning models were selected: linear regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine. These models were compared with a time series prediction model. We found that the set of subjective metrics is able to improve the prediction performance for all the models. The support vector machine showed the best prediction results compared to the other models."

"Using GNSS data for real-time moisture analysis and forecasting over the Australian Region I. The system Precipitable Water; Global Positioning System; GNSS The use of high spatial and temporal resolution data assimilation and forecasting around Australia's capital cities and rural land provides an opportunity to improve moisture analysis and forecasting. To support this endeavour, RMIT University and Geoscience Australia have worked with the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) to provide real-time GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Zenith Total Delay (ZTD) data over the Australian region, from which a high-resolution total water vapour field for SE Australia can be determined. The ZTD data can play an important role in high-resolution data assimilation by providing mesoscale moisture data coverage from existing GNSS surface stations over significant areas of the Australian continent. The data are now used by the BoM's high-resolution ACCESS-C3 capital city NWP systems, the ACCESS-G3 Global system and have been used by the ACCESS-R2-Regional NWP model. A description of the data collection and analysis system is provided. An example of the application of these local GNSS data for a heavy rainfall event over SE Australia/Victoria is shown using the 1.5km resolution ACCESS-C3 model, which is being prepared for operational use. The results from the test have been assessed qualitatively/synoptically and also have been examined quantitatively using the Fractions Skills Score which shows the reasonableness of the forecasts and demonstrates the potential for improving rainfall forecasts over south-eastern Australia by the inclusion of ZTD data in constructing the moisture field. These data have now been accepted for operational use in NWP."

"International approaches to protecting and retaining trees on private urban land Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Most studies of urban forest management look at vegetation on public land. Yet, to meet ambitious urban forest targets, cities must attempt to maintain or increase trees and canopy cover on private urban land too. In this study, we review and evaluate international approaches to protecting and retaining trees on private urban land. Our study combines a systematic academic literature review, two empirical social science studies on the views of urban forest professionals, and a global case study review of innovative regulations and incentives aimed at protecting and retaining trees on private urban land. Case studies were evaluated for the extent they exceeded minimum standards or went beyond â€˜business-as-usualâ€™. We found that the most innovative mechanisms combine many regulations, instead of relying on a single regulation, and use financial incentives to retain or plant trees in newly developed or re-developed sites, as well as private residences. We did not find any cases where appropriate monitoring was in place to determine the efficacy and efficiency of these mechanisms. We also found no single simple solution that could effectively and efficiently protect and retain trees on private land. Only by combining policies, planning schemes, local laws, and financial incentives with community engagement and stewardship will cities protect and retain trees on private land. Useful and innovative ways to protecting and retaining trees on private land involves providing solutions at multiple governments levels, embedding trees in existing strategic policy and management solutions, incentivising positive behavior, creating regulations that require payment up front, and engaging the broader community in private tree stewardship."

"Internet of Things and autonomous control for vertical cultivation walls towards smart food growing: A review Green Roofs; Hot Temperature; Sedum Acre The development of green spaces in urban areas is rapidly on the rise as more people are keen to maintain a clean and green atmosphere around where they live and work. Also, the link between the physical world and the internet has been a driving force in enhancing people's quality of life which has resulted in the most recent and rising technologies, collectively referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). The adoption of vertical gardens (VG) and/or vertical farms (VF) can be beneficial for maintaining a sustainable environment, as well as for expanding food security in an urban context around the world with limited land space. IoT technologies have the potential to be key enablers in the accelerated adoption of VG. In this study, we investigate the critical parameters for automating sustainable vertical gardening systems by using the IoT concept in smart cities towards smart living. This involves collection and review of data from 30 peer-reviewed publications published between 2004 and 2018, including real-world VG implementations. The key criteria considered include: (i) crop/plant type, (ii) VG topology (size), (iii) sensing data, (iv) used hardware (sensors, actuators, etc.), (v) power supplies, (vi) velocity or frequency of data collection, (vii) data storage method, (viii) communication technologies, (ix) data analysis methods/algorithm, (x) other used strategies, and (xi) countries that implemented VGs. The data were subsequently analyzed to obtain a detailed understanding of using IoT in VGs. The results of the analysis revealed that most of the studies used 6-20 tiers (40%) when implementing VGs, and the most popular crop was lettuce (28.6%). The sensors used were commonly connected to AC power and battery (each 44.4%), while only a small proportion of VGs used solar power (11.1%). The majority of IoT sensors used were to measure room temperature (22.5%), light intensity (21.1%), humidity level (14%) and soil nutrition (7%). The frequency of data collection by these sensors was between 1 and 3 minutes (42.8%). The frequently used data transmission technology was Zigbee and Wi-Fi (42.8%) for collecting sensor data from VGs. We also found that, using the server database, remote data management platform and cloud were the most popular data storage methods (each 25%). After data collection, many studies used threshold-based algorithms (50%) for the decision making, and the soil-based (42%) and hydroponic (38%) were the most popular plant cultivation technologies. The use of recycled and reused water (30%), solar power (20%) and controlled indoor environment, without sun or soil (20%) are some of the other essential considerations in VGs. Furthermore, it was found that the most significant focus on automation of VGs incorporating IoT were in USA (41.2%) and China (23.5%). The impact of vertical cultivation walls on human well-being was discussed. In addition to this, eight international patents on VGs have been analyzed to acquire an implementation understanding of autonomous control or using IoT in vertical gardens."

"Does procedural justice climate increase the identification and engagement of migrant workers? A group engagement model perspective Fairness; Social Exchange Theory; Fairness Perceptions Purpose: Migrant workers often suffer from social exclusion in the workplace and therefore identify less with their organization and engage less with their work. To address this issue, the authors integrate research on migrant workers with research on the group engagement model to create a model for understanding and enhancing migrant worker engagement. This allows us to provide insight into how organizations can design their human resource management systems and practices to increase the work engagement of migrant workers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a survey study with over 4,000 employees from more than 500 workplaces in Australia to test the model. Findings: The results of the multilevel analysis indicate that a procedurally fair work environment increases organizational identification, which in turn is associated with higher work engagement. The results also indicate that procedural justice climate is more important for migrant workers and increases their organizational identification and engagement. Originality/value: To increase work engagement of migrant workers, organizations can establish a procedurally fair work environment in which cultural minorities experience unbiased policies and procedures, are able to express their opinions and participate in decision-making."
"Language and communication issues in HIV/AIDS intervention management in the South African construction industry: Interview survey findings AIDS/HIV; Child Mortality; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Purpose: Effective communication is a key factor in presenting Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) awareness and prevention campaigns, and delivering treatment programmes, particularly in South Africa where different ethnic groups and a diversity of languages and educational attainment levels are encountered. Language is an important element of such communication. The purpose of this paper is to examine the communication effectiveness of AIDS-related intervention messages. Design/methodology/approach: Case-based semi-structured interviews, with 42 employees from three construction organisations, and with six telephone counsellors from a service provider, were used to explore language in the HIV/AIDS context in the construction industry in the Western Cape region. Findings: Workersâ€™ knowledge about HIV (a key element in prevention and willingness to engage in treatment regimes) tended to align with their level of education. African cultures may inhibit the use of plain language about AIDS. Graphic posters with text in different languages were the most preferred communication media, but need periodic refreshment to remain effective. For toolbox talks and other company presentations, a comprehensive approach to language differences is limited, and appropriate confirmatory feedback loops are not used â€“ the message sent is not always the message received. The recruitment and training processes for service provider counsellors ensure a more comprehensive grasp of HIV knowledge and a more consistent approach to communication. Practical implications: Construction organisations should be more careful in their HIV/AIDS campaigns and programmes, ensure better targeting of audiences and pay more nuanced and sensitive attention to language needs, gender differences and cultural contexts with respect to communicating with workers in ways that engage them more fully about HIV/AIDS, stigma and disclosure. Originality/value: Communication effectiveness is pivotal in the provision of intervention management by construction firms. Ineffective language and communication processes directly and adversely influence HIV/AIDS intervention management success."

"Serotonin-induced vascular permeability is mediated by transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 in the airways and upper gastrointestinal tract of mice Transient Receptor Potential Channels; Animals; RN 1734 Endothelial and epithelial cells form physical barriers that modulate the exchange of fluid and molecules. The integrity of these barriers can be influenced by signaling through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. Serotonin (5-HT) is an important vasoactive mediator of tissue edema and inflammation. However, the mechanisms that drive 5-HT-induced plasma extravasation are poorly defined. The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channel is an established enhancer of signaling by GPCRs that promote inflammation and endothelial barrier disruption. Here, we investigated the role of TRPV4 in 5-HT-induced plasma extravasation using pharmacological and genetic approaches. Activation of either TRPV4 or 5-HT receptors promoted significant plasma extravasation in the airway and upper gastrointestinal tract of mice. 5-HT-mediated extravasation was significantly reduced by pharmacological inhibition of the 5-HT2A receptor subtype, or with antagonism or deletion of TRPV4, consistent with functional interaction between 5-HT receptors and TRPV4. Inhibition of receptors for the neuropeptides substance P (SP) or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) diminished 5-HT-induced plasma extravasation. Supporting studies assessing treatment of HUVEC with 5-HT, CGRP, or SP was associated with ERK phosphorylation. Exposure to the TRPV4 activator GSK1016790A, but not 5-HT, increased intracellular Ca2+ in these cells. However, 5-HT pre-treatment enhanced GSK1016790A-mediated Ca2+ signaling, consistent with sensitization of TRPV4. The functional interaction was further characterized in HEK293 cells expressing 5-HT2A to reveal that TRPV4 enhances the duration of 5-HT-evoked Ca2+ signaling through a PLA2 and PKC-dependent mechanism. In summary, this study demonstrates that TRPV4 contributes to 5-HT2A-induced plasma extravasation in the airways and upper GI tract, with evidence supporting a mechanism of action involving SP and CGRP release."
"Climate change impacts on rice-based livelihood vulnerability in the lower Vietnamese Mekong Delta: Empirical evidence from Can Tho City and Tra Vinh Province Mekong River; Dams; Hydropower This paper assesses the livelihood vulnerability and adaptive capacity of rice-based farmers in the lower Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) under the impact of climate change and environmental pressures. We interviewed 600 rice farmers in 19 communes spanning six districts of Can Tho City (middle delta) and Tra Vinh Province (coastal delta). For our analyses, we employed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) framework and the LVI approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (LVIâ€“IPCC). Results indicate that both study areas are vulnerable to climate change and environmental pressures, but the potential threat is greater in the coastal province. Farmers there have responded to climate change and environmental pressures by increasing production inputs, scaling up production areas and transforming cropping patterns, though with little investment in new equipment. Yet, their livelihoods from rice cultivation, and agricultural production in general, remain unsustainable under climate change, which is a matter of concern. This study provides empirical evidence of the vulnerability factors that most undermine farmersâ€™ adaptive capacity and livelihood sustainability in the study areas. This will help local authorities in providing timely support to agricultural production management."

"Effects of salinity on the growth and nutrition of taro (Colocasia esculenta): Implications for food security Salt Tolerance; Sodium Proton Exchange Protein; Salinity Taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott) is a staple food crop in the Asia-Pacific region in areas where rising sea levels are threatening agricultural production. However, little is known about its response to salinity. In this study, we investigated the effects of salinity on the growth, morphology, physiology, and chemical traits of taro to predict the impacts of rising sea levels on taro production and nutritional value in the Pacific. We grew taro (approximately 4 months old) with a range of NaCl treatments (0â€“200 mM) for 12 weeks. Full nutrient, micronutrient, and secondary metabolite analyses were conducted, including measures of calcium oxalate (CaOx), an irritant that reduces palatability. Significant reductions in growth and biomass were observed at and above 100 mM NaCl. Concentrations of macro-and micronutrients, including sodium, were higher on a per mass basis in corms of plants experiencing salt stress. Foliar sodium concentrations remained stable, indicating that taro may utilize a salt exclusion mechanism. There was a large amount of individual variation in the concentrations of oxalate and phenolics, but overall, the concentrations were similar in the plants grown with different levels of salt. The total contents of CaOx and phenolics decreased in plants experiencing salt stress. Taroâ€™s ability to survive and produce corms when watered with a 200 mM NaCl solution places it among the salt-tolerant non-halophytes. The nutritional quality of the crop is only marginally affected by salt stress. Taro is, therefore, likely to remain a useful staple in the Pacific region in the future."

"Upcycling Domestic Food Waste 2.0: Aeration, Water Content and Temperature in Home Compost Systems Maze and RMIT University intend to continue their research collaboration on home composting systems. Discussions on 20/1/2021 explored next steps to consolidate results of the first project comparing the performance of 9 bin designs by focusing on the curing phase,
ideas to further investigate the effects of aeration on the performance of two key bin designs and future research interests around additives. A long term goal of the research partnership was identified; To develop a list of ten different home composting solutions, or recipes, underpinned by rigorous science. Composting is a complex system, with interacting biophysical and socio-economic components. This research partnership brings together Maze’s expertise in the socio-economic space and RMIT’s expertise in the bio-physical space. The first project developed the collaborative partnership and the experimental methodology for research on home composting systems. The two experiments outlined in the following pages consolidate this first project (Experiment 1) and investigate aeration, via water addition and mixing, and temperature. These experiments are within the scope of a 1 year, $100K Innovation Connections grant project. Maze and RMIT are interested to explore the performance of additions to home composting systems such as different carbon sources (paper, wood pellets, sawdust, other agricultural or forestry wastes), biological additives (worms, bokashi EM formulations). The interactions between these additives and aeration could be explored in a series of experiments funded via an Australian Research Council Linkage grant."

"Optimal Solar Plant Site Identification Using GIS and Remote Sensing: Framework and Case Study Solar Farms; Solar Power Plants; Global Positioning System Many countries have set a goal for a carbon neutral future, and the adoption of solar energy as an alternative energy source to fossil fuel is one of the major measures planned. Yet not all locations are equally suitable for solar energy generation. This is due to uneven solar radiation distribution as well as various environmental factors. A number of studies in the literature have used multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to determine the most suitable places to build solar power plants. To the best of our knowledge, no study has addressed the subject of optimal solar plant site identification for the Al-Qassim region, although developing renewable energy in Saudi Arabia has been put on the agenda. This paper developed a spatial MCDA framework catering to the characteristics of the Al-Qassim region. The framework adopts several tools used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), such as Random Forest (RF) raster classification and model builder. The framework aims to ascertain the ideal sites for solar power plants in the Al-Qassim region in terms of the amount of potential photovoltaic electricity production (PVOUT) that could be produced from solar energy. For that, a combination of GIS and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques were employed to determine five sub-criteria weights (Slope, Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), proximity to roads, proximity to residential areas, proximity to powerlines) before perform-ing spatial MCDA. The result showed that â€˜the most suitableâ€™ and â€˜suitableâ€™ areas for the establish-ment of solar plants are in the south and southwest of the region, representing about 17.53% of the study area. The â€˜unsuitableâ€™ areas account for about 10.17% of the total study area, which is mainly concentrated in the northern part. The rest of the region is further classified into â€˜moderateâ€™ and â€˜restrictedâ€™ areas, which account for 46.42% and 25.88%, respectively. The most suitable area for potential solar energy, yields approximately 1905 Kwh/Kwp in terms of PVOUT. The proposed framework also has the potential to be applied to other regions nationally and internationally. This work contributes a reproducible GIS workflow for a low-cost but accurate adoption of a solar energy plan to achieve sustainable development goals."

"Smart mobility adoption: A review of the literature Smart Cities; Big Data; Internet of Things Traffic congestion and air pollution continue to be serious concerns, especially in large cities, and going forward, this is not sustainable. Urban transport around the world is facing challenges, such as air pollution and inefficient use of resources, that often inhibit economic development. Simply building more roads cannot address such challenges. There is a need to integrate the urban infrastructure through smart connectivity. Smart mobility, as a vital cornerstone of a smart city, will potentially reduce traffic jams, commuting times, and road crashes and create an opportunity for passengers to customize their journeys. In fact, planning smart mobility solutions is among the top challenges for large cities around the world. It involves a set of deliberate actions backed by sophisticated technologies. The different elements and dimensions that characterize smart mobility are investigated to depict the overall picture surrounding the smart mobility domain. Additionally, the trends, opportunities, and threats inherent to smart mobility are addressed. There are four segments of smart mobility that are highlighted in this paper: intelligent transport systems, open data, big data analytics, and citizen engagement. These segments are all inter-related and play a crucial role in the successful implementation of smart mobility."

"The relationship between fire and weeds in Victorian grasslands: A case study of Terrick Terrick National Park (PhD student: Isabelle Hally) Prescribed burns are often recommended for controlling exotic weeds, but in some cases, fire is known to facilitate weed invasion. The aim of this project is to understand when prescribed burns can successfully suppress weed invasion and facilitate native vegetation recovery. We will combine field surveys of native and exotic plant communities pre- and post-fire, measurements of environmental variables including soil microbial community sampling, and experimental removal of invasive weeds, to understand the mechanisms in which fire constrains or facilitates plant invasion. This project will inform future management of exotic weeds in fire-prone environments."

"Beyond the luxury effect: Individual and structural drivers lead to ‘urban forest inequity’ in public street trees in Melbourne, Australia Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Urban trees are increasingly being used to help cities adapt to climate change, improve health and wellbeing, and promote biodiversity. Yet these benefits are distributed unequally, mirroring the uneven distribution of the urban forest in many cities. Contrasting theories have been proposed to explain these observed patterns that focus either on the economic wherewithal of individuals (the â€˜luxury effectâ€™), or the outcome of structural factors such as municipal decision-making processes. Here, we explore patterns across 10 municipal authorities in greater Melbourne, Australia to compare the relative importance of these competing mechanisms. We show that both individual and structural processes are both major determinants of the density and diversity of trees in this large Australian city. Interestingly, education level was strongly related to tree density, while household income was negatively related to tree density and diversity in some municipalities. The luxury effect was not able to adequately explain the patterns observed in Melbourne. This finding has important implications for the planning and management of urban forests and the equitable distribution of the benefits they provide, in the context of the rapid expansion of urban populations across the globe. To counteract inequity, local municipalities must acknowledge and deliberately overcome internal biases that favour the provision of street trees to more advantaged sections of the community."

"An Epistemic Context-Based Decision-Making Framework for an Infrastructure Project Investment Decision in Indonesia Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management Contextual information is a crucial delimitation that needs to be considered. A review of the literature suggests the need to develop a context-based decision-making framework (DMF) to improve the quality of the decision-making process. However, retrieving the right information within a specific decision-making context is not an easy task and requires a comprehensive study. To address this need, this study focuses on developing an epistemic context-based DMF. The contextualization was carried out by thoroughly investigating the three epistemic context dimensions related to infrastructure project planning and selection processes in Indonesia. This study adopts a mixed-method approach consisting of contextual information, contextual analysis, contextual synthesis, and contextual validation. All findings were used to develop the DMF, which was validated in a realistic setting. This study is meaningful because the developed DMF can advance the project investment evaluation process by bridging the gap between infrastructure assessment constraints and epistemic context awareness. The retrieval of relevant information within a context is considered useful to configure the required setting needed in the development of a DMF, thus enhancing the relevancy and usability of the proposed DMF."
"Investigating fatigue related motorcycle taxi crashes Distracted Driving; Young Drivers; Distraction Motorcycle taxis are a popular means of transport in many cities, especially in South-East Asia. The recent booming of ride-hailing services has led to a dramatic growth in the fleet of motorcycle taxis, raising concerns about the safety of motorcycle taxi drivers. Like professional car and truck drivers who often have long working hours, motorcycle taxi drivers would similarly be vulnerable to fatigue related crashes. This paper therefore explores self-reported fatigue-related crashes (including falls and other single vehicle crashes) among motorcycle taxi drivers in Hanoi, Vietnam. A survey of motorcycle taxi drivers was conducted in early 2019. Results show that the prevalence of fatigue-related crashes among motorcycle taxi drivers was approximately 16%. Nearly 37% of all self-reported crashes among motorcycle taxi drivers were related to fatigue. Negative binomial regression was used to explore factors influencing the frequency of fatigue related crashes. Regression results indicate that working fulltime, riding hour, delivery trips, and overweight conditions are associated with increasing fatigue-related crashes. Working night shift and passenger trips were found to be negatively associated with fatigue-related crashes. Implications for transport and safety policy are also discussed."

"The “Gender Agenda” in Agriculture for Development and Its (Lack of) Alignment With Feminist Scholarship Farmers; Women in Agriculture; Farm Families Sustainable food systems require sustainable agriculture. To achieve this, we argue, inclusive approaches are required that incorporate the voices and lived experiences of diverse social groups. In agriculture-based international development efforts (known as Agriculture for Development or A4D), it is increasingly being recognized that sustainable agriculture requires attention to gendered power relations. In the past, gender inequality has been a major barrier to developing inclusive, sustainable food systems, and continues to be so today. At the same time, however, gender is increasingly â€œon the agendaâ€ in A4D. Yet what sort of agenda is being promoted and to what extent does it reflect progress in feminist scholarship? We examine the burgeoning â€œgender agendaâ€ through the lens of policy materials produced by prominent A4D organizations. In doing so, we find problematic narratives that instrumentalise women in the name of sustainable agricultural development. However, we also find other more transformative discourses that, in troubling the drivers of gender inequality and promoting shared responsibility for change, reflect a deeper awareness of feminist scholarship. In any effort to advance sustainable agriculture, further progress is needed to address the myriad ways gender pervades not just development settings but development institutions and donor nations, and contributes to the production of as well as responses to global A4D challenges."

"Preventing child sexual abuse: A systematic review of interventions and their efficacy in developing countries Adverse Childhood Experiences; Maltreatment; Child Abuse Background: Research on prevalence, risk factors, and prevention interventions for child sexual abuse has continued to focus on western and developed countries. Where country-level prevalence data or large-scale research exists, rates of child sexual abuse are consistently higher in developing and non-western countries than their western and developed counterparts. Objective: We systematically reviewed research on the nature of child sexual abuse interventions in developing countries, the settings and populations included to identify types of child sexual abuse prevention initiatives being implemented in developing countries and their effectiveness. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of six databases and identified eight studies to include in our analysis. Results: Most empirically evaluated interventions in developing countries have focused on preschool and primary school-aged children. Most have focused on interventions delivered in educational settings, with a lack of focus on population-level interventions to prevent child sexual abuse. Researchers have used outcomes measuring knowledge or skills for young people in self-protection and help-seeking, not deployment of those skills, actual reduction in prevalence of CSA, or improvements in conditions of safety in organizational contexts. Conclusions: If the focus on school-based strategies to prevent child sexual abuse continues in developing countries, a significant gap in knowledge of the efficacy of population-level interventions outside of school contexts, and consistency across the application of interventions will remain. Evaluations are needed that address the efficacy of broader government-led or whole-of-community prevention interventions to reduce actual prevalence of child sexual abuse, or that can link increased knowledge and skill with reduced victimization."

"Aquatic plants, landoltia punctata, and azolla filiculoides as bio‐converters of wastewater to biofuel Araceae; Bioremediation; Landoltia Punctata The aquatic plants, Azolla filiculoides, and Landoltia punctate, were used as complementing phytoremediators of wastewater containing high levels of phosphate, which simulates the effluents from textile, dyeing, and laundry detergent industries. Their complementarities are based on differences in capacities to uptake nitrogen and phosphate components from wastewater. Sequential treatment by L. punctata followed by A. filiculoides led to complete removal of NH4, NO3, and up to 93% reduction of PO4. In experiments where L. punctata treatment was followed by fresh L. punctata, PO4 concentration was reduced by 65%. The toxicity of wastewater assessed by shrimps, Paratya australiensis, showed a fourâ€fold reduction of their mortality (LC50 value) after treatment. Collected dry biomass was used as an alternative carbon source for heterotrophic marine protists, thraustochytrids, which produced up to 35% dry weight of lipids rich in palmitic acid (50% of total fatty acids), the key fatty acid for biodiesel production. The fermentation of treated L. punctata biomass by Enterobacter cloacae yielded up to 2.14 mol H2/mole of reduced sugar, which is comparable with leading terrestrial feedstocks. A. filiculoides and L. punctata can be used as a new generation of feedstock, which can treat different types of wastewater and represent renewable and sustainable feedstock for bioenergy production."

"Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic cuttlebone with an inherent lamellar structure for continuous and effective oil spill cleanup Water; Hydrophobicity; Aerogels Oil wastes pose an enormous threat to aquatic ecosystems, and environmental and economic demands emphasize the importance of affordable and sustainable oil absorbents. To tackle this issue, we propose the repurposing of abundant and low-cost cuttlebone from the ocean to address oil spills for the ocean. By the simple, successive deposition of polydopamine and a mixture of fluorinated silica nanoparticles and polydimethylsiloxane, the ultralight, porous, and mechanically stable cuttlebone is endowed with excellent superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity. The as-obtained cuttlebone exhibits high absorption performance for various hydrocarbons and is successfully applied in a series of oil/water mixture separations. On this basis, an oil-collecting â€œcephalopodâ€ electric device is designed by combining superhydrophobic/superoleophilic cuttlebone with a pumping system, and demonstrates excellent collection efficiency and recyclability for oil spill cleanup. This work provides a valuable perspective on the development of high-performance oil absorbents derived from sustainable natural marine products."

"Employment discrimination against gender diverse individuals in Western Australia Transgender Persons; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Workplace Purpose: This paper explores employment discrimination against gender diverse job applicants and employees in Western Australia (WA). Design/methodology/approach: Using grounded theory, this study draws on semi-structured interviews with respondents (n = 20) who identified as trans women, trans men, nonbinary or agender. Thematic analysis focused on the multiple dimensions of disadvantage experienced by respondents, including subtle, not so subtle and overt types of employment discrimination. Findings: The authorsâ€™ results point to several reasons why gender diverse individuals (GDIs) may fear the labor market, including difficulties in concealing their stigma and acquiescence to discrimination. On the other hand, our results also point to sources of organizational support, including encouragement from direct line managers and colleagues who are also Allies. Practical implications: The results of the research have important implications for sociological frameworks surrounding dramaturgy, stigma, aesthetic labor, organizational silence and social identity. Practical implications for employers, employees, human resource (HR) professionals and trade unions are also articulated. Originality/value: Whereas previous studies have prioritized the discriminatory experiences of GDIs in the US and European labor markets, this study reports on gender diverse voices in WA. Furthermore, recent work on this topic has been experimental and largely quantitative, whereas the present study offers a compelling set of profound narratives, thereby addressing calls for qualitative research that foregrounds the complexities and nuances of lived experience for GDIs and renders their voices heard."

"Asian contributions to communication for development and social change Acetone Hydrazone; Indonesian Islam; Sharia The debates on the role of media and communications in promoting sustainable development acknowledge the multiple experiments that were undertaken from the 1940s and 1950s as being key to laying the foundations of the field we now call development communication or communication for development. Yet, as has been emphasized over the years, it is the agriculture communication and extension experiments at the University of the Philippines, Los BaÃ±os, that would herald the pioneering contestation of development thinking using media and communication in Asia. Considered together with the Asian Tigersâ€™ approaches toward radical economic development, the Asiaâ€™s schools, institutions, organizations, and governments demonstrated that there was a different way of thinking about and doing development beyond what the western modernist theories and perspectives were proffering. This chapter is a celebration of the Asian contributions to development communication, which was a term employed by the pioneers of the field. Over the years, other terms have come into use, including communication for development and social change. While the emphasis has been placed in the fact that these were pioneering contributions, this chapter examines the specific attributes of such a contribution and how, considered in retrospective, students of society will come to appreciate the fundamental aspects of theory and practice today that trace their origins to these experiments. The chapter highlights seven of these contributions in order to demonstrate the fundamental concerns that drive the agenda, processes, and partnerships in the field. The chapter acknowledges that the field has moved on; there is a growing danger of a growing disregard for history, as if the field just emerged without a historical context. Yet it is this very historicity, in Asia, as much as in Latin America and Africa, that continues to shape the practice on the ground, even in the face of the historical revisionism of modernist development approaches mostly being promoted by international development institutions."
"The Environmental Kuznets Curve across Australian states and territories Environmental Kuznets Curve; China; Trade Openness We test the Environmental Kuznets Curves (EKC) hypothesis for a panel of eight Australian states and territories using non-parametric panel estimation over the period 1990 to 2017. A feature of our non-parametric estimation method is that it allows carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to evolve over time in the form of an unknown functional form with confidence bands constructed using a wild bootstrapping method. This framework has the advantage that we can plot the time-varying relationship between Gross State Product (GSP) and CO2 emissions. The non-parametric local linear estimates for GSP are consistent with a conventional inverted U-shaped EKC, which peaks in 2010 and declines thereafter. The peak coincides with a significant policy shift in Australia's commitment to reducing CO2 emissions, whereby, in 2010, the Australian Government, and subsequently the states and territories, pledged to reduce CO2 emissions to 5% below 2000 levels by 2020 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (the Cancun Agreement)."
"Evaluation of hot spots: place-based, cross-sector collaborations responding to the health impacts of heatwave The Project Team has extensive and proven experience in successfully analysing and coproducing a range of engagement materials and approaches for place-based adaptation and resilience (See above). All of which has direct relevance and application for evaluating placebased activities seeking to reduce local vulnerabilities to various implications of climate change such as heatwaves. However, it is a priority to RMIT and LMCF that this evaluation extends existing skills and knowledge of all participants, encourages skill and capability development, and enables all participants to learn throughout the project. We therefore propose a collaborative, co-learning approach to the evaluation whereby the research team (RMIT) will support LMCF and the Hotspots project partners to design and undertake the evaluation themselves. RMIT will also work with them to reflect on what they learned through the process not just about the Hotspots program but also about evaluation and engagihg in a place-based1 cross-sector program such as the Hotspots Initiative."

"Forecasting of Rainfall Using General Circulation Model -Statistical Modelling in Johor Climate Change; CMIP; Regional Climate Immaculate prediction of rainfall in a catchment is intrinsic for hydrologists to facilitate water resources management and flood risks assessment. Hence, the forecast rainfall and rainfall pattern, due to climate change needs to be investigated for guidance in managing water resources in Johor. In this paper, the impacts of climate change on rainfall variability in Johor was investigated by using General Circulation Model (GCM) on the availability of daily simulation for three representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for interval year of âˆ†2030, âˆ†2050 and A2080. Daily rainfall data from eight (8) stations spreading all around Johor capturing 30 years period (1988-2017) were considered for the study. There is considerable variation of mean annual rainfall in different parts of Johor. As for example, the mean annual rainfall can be as low as 1714.9 mm at Ladang Paya Lang, Segamat station to as high as 2603.6 mm at Ladang Pekan Layang-layang, Kluang. Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) was used effectually to carry out predictor selection as well as future rainfall projection. The study noted that temperature (nceptemp), surface specific humidity (ncepshum) and near surface relative humidity (nceprhum) had the most significant influence in the local weather formations with R values ranged from 0.5 to 0.7. In addition, low standard error (SE) ranging from 3.82% to 11.64% was observed for all the stations considered in the study. The annual mean rainfall for RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 was predicted increase by of 17.5%, 18.1% and 18.3%, respectively as compared to historical data. Kluang was predicted to receive the highest amount of rainfall, and the lowest was in Segamat. The eastern part of Johor was expected to receive higher rainfall intensity and then disperse to the western part of Johor. It is expected that improved knowledge about predictions of future rainfall will expedite the mitigation strategies regarding climate change effect in Johor."
"Non-Combustibility of Concrete Firesafe UK has categorised building fires as the primary fire incidents with the most serious consequence. Recent devastating incidents with building fires around the world have raised an alarming concern on the use of new materials to meet the aesthetic, thermal and acoustic performance while the fire reaction of construction materials has not been carefully considered. Recent changes in the National Construction Code have reflected these concerns and the interest in developing scientific insight into materials performance during a fire.

Concrete has always been known to possess excellent thermal mass and a deemed-tosatisfy candidate as a non-combustibility construction material. However, the view of the broad society on concrete performance is limited and biased in comparison to other materials owing to other aspects of performance such as insulation and sustainability.

In this project, Innovative Fire & Facade Engineering group (IFFE) and Cement Concrete & Aggregates aim to conduct a series of tests to illustrate the performance and benefits of concrete as a building material in fire incidents. The tests are performed in accordance with
NCC 2019 or specifically designed to suit this purpose. A report will be generated at the end of the project to include (1) Testing procedure; (2) Results - in the form of either graphs, tables and/or video footage of conducted tests; and (3) Relevant recommendation in
accordance with NCC 2019 for concrete."

"Global Review and Analysis of the Presence of Microplastics in Fish Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter This review provides an account of fish species contaminated with microplastics (MPs) across the globe (seven continents). A total of 887 fish species were found contaminated with MPs based on MPs in the gastrointestinal tract/GI. The most MPs contaminated-fish species found were marine and demersal species. Globally 45 % of fish ingested MPs with an average concentration of 5.93 MPs particles per fish species. Among all the countries, China had the highest number of fish species contaminated with MPs in the following orders: China (176 species), Brazil (84), the USA (48), India (35), the Atlantic Ocean (31), Iran (30), Bangladesh (28), Turkey (26), Indonesia (25), the UK (23), Saudi Arabia (23), Thailand (21), Portugal (20), Australia (20), Italy (18), South Africa (18), Argentina (15), Chile (14), Galapagos Islands (Ecuador) (14), the North Pacific Gyre (14), Samoa (13), Malaysia (12), Colombia (11), New Zealand (11), Fiji (10), Spain (10), the North Sea (09), South Korea (09), Tahiti (09), Vanuatu (09), Ghana (08), Canada (07), Japan (07) and Nigeria (07) and others. MPs ingestion in fishes varied (high, medium, and low) among the locations/countries. In several locations/countries, MPs ingestion/contamination occurred in up to 100 % of fish samples. Because of MPs contamination, seafood fisheries, and the livelihoods of people associated with fishing, aquaculture, and seafood business, can be threatened. It may also increase health risks to seafood fish consumers since there is a probability that high risks pollutants adsorbed in MPs can be transferred to humans via the food chain."

"Use of health services by preschool-aged children who are developmentally vulnerable and socioeconomically disadvantaged: Testing the inverse care law Children with Medical Complexity; Health Care Need; Medicaid Aim The inverse care law suggests that those with the greatest need for services are least likely to receive them. Our aim of this study was to test the inverse care law in relation to the use of health services by children aged 4-5 years in Australia who were developmentally vulnerable and socioeconomically disadvantaged. Method Cross-sectional data were collected from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children birth cohort when the children were aged 4-5 years. Children were grouped according to the combination of developmental vulnerability (yes, no) and socioeconomic disadvantage (lower, higher), resulting in four groups (reference group: developmentally vulnerable and disadvantaged). Multivariate regression was used to examine the impact of the combination of developmental vulnerability and disadvantage on health service use, adjusting for other sociodemographic characteristics. Results 3967 (90%) of children had data on developmental vulnerability at 4-5 years. A third of children (32.6%) were classified as developmentally vulnerable, and 10%-25% of these children had used health services. Non-disadvantaged children who were developmentally vulnerable (middle need) had 1.4-2.0 times greater odds of using primary healthcare, specialist and hospital services; and non-disadvantaged children who were not developmentally vulnerable (lowest need) had 1.6-1.8 times greater odds of using primary healthcare services, compared with children who were developmentally vulnerable and disadvantaged (highest need). Conclusion We found some evidence of the inverse care law. Equity in service delivery remains a challenge that is critically important to tackle in ensuring a healthy start for children."
"Assessment and management of lake eutrophication: A case study in Lake Erhai, China Sediment-Water Interface; Total Dissolved Phosphorus; Sediment Some wastewater sources, such as agricultural waste and runoff, and industrial sewage, can degrade water quality. This study summarises the sources and corresponding mechanisms that trigger eutrophication in lakes. Additionally, the trophic status index and water quality index (WQI) which are effective tools for evaluating the degree of eutrophication of lakes, have been discussed. This study also explores the main nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) driving transformations in the water body and sediment. Lake Erhai was used as a case study, and it was found to be in a mesotrophic state, with N and P co-limitation before 2006, and only P limitation since 2006. Finally, effective measures to maintain sustainable development in the watershed are proposed, along with a framework for an early warning system adopting the latest technologies (geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing (RS)) for preventing eutrophication."

"Technology-Facilitated Domestic and Sexual Violence: A Review Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica This article investigates the phenomenon of domestic and sexual violence against adult women using digital communications technologies. The article explores terminological and conceptual challenges and describes the empirical research literature in this field to date in relation to digital dating abuse, intimate partner cyberstalking, technology-facilitated sexual assault, image-based sexual abuse, and online sexual harassment. The article also discusses policy and practice responses to this growing problem, as well as future directions for research. We argue that research and practice need to be guided by existing conceptual frameworks that utilize gender and actorâ€“network theory to understanding the causes and consequences of womenâ€™s experiences of abuse and violence facilitated by digital technologies."
"Trends in HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality in Eastern Mediterranean countries, 1990–2015: findings from the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study Global Burden of Disease; Disability-Adjusted Life Year; Disability Weights Objectives: We used the results of the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study to estimate trends of HIV/AIDS burden in Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries between 1990 and 2015. Methods: Tailored estimation methods were used to produce final estimates of mortality. Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated by multiplying the mortality rate by population by age-specific life expectancy. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were computed as the prevalence of a sequela multiplied by its disability weight. Results: In 2015, the rate of HIV/AIDS deaths in the EMR was 1.8 (1.4â€“2.5) per 100,000 population, a 43% increase from 1990 (0.3; 0.2â€“0.8). Consequently, the rate of YLLs due to HIV/AIDS increased from 15.3 (7.6â€“36.2) per 100,000 in 1990 to 81.9 (65.3â€“114.4) in 2015. The rate of YLDs increased from 1.3 (0.6â€“3.1) in 1990 to 4.4 (2.7â€“6.6) in 2015. Conclusions: HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality increased in the EMR since 1990. To reverse this trend and achieve epidemic control, EMR countries should strengthen HIV surveillance, and scale up HIV antiretroviral therapy and comprehensive prevention services."

"The Southern Bluefin Tuna Mucosal Microbiome Is Influenced by Husbandry Method, Net Pen Location, and Anti-parasite Treatment Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus Aquaculture is the fastest growing primary industry worldwide. Marine finfish culture in open ocean net pens, or pontoons, is one of the largest growth areas and is currently the only way to rear high value fish such as bluefin tuna. Ranching involves catching wild juveniles, stocking in floating net pens and fattening for 4 to 8 months. Tuna experience several parasite-induced disease challenges in culture that can be mitigated by application of praziquantel (PZQ) as a therapeutic. In this study, we characterized the microbiome of ranched southern Bluefin Tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, across four anatomic sites (gill, skin, digesta, and anterior kidney) and evaluated environmental and pathological factors that influence microbiome composition, including the impact of PZQ treatment on microbiome stability. Southern bluefin tuna gill, skin, and digesta microbiome communities are unique and potentially influenced by husbandry practices, location of pontoon growout pens, and treatment with the antiparasitic PZQ. There was no significant relationship between the fish mucosal microbiome and incidence or abundance of adult blood fluke in the heart or fluke egg density in the gill. An enhanced understanding of microbiome diversity and function in high-value farmed fish species such as bluefin tuna is needed to optimize fish health and improve aquaculture yield. Comparison of the bluefin tuna microbiome to other fish species, including Seriola lalandi (yellowtail kingfish), a common farmed species from Australia, and Scomber japonicus (Pacific mackerel), a wild caught Scombrid relative of tuna, showed the two Scombrids had more similar microbial communities compared to other families. The finding that mucosal microbial communities are more similar in phylogenetically related fish species exposes an opportunity to develop mackerel as a model for tuna microbiome and parasite research."

"Exploring indigenous employee voice practice: perspectives from Vietnamese public sector organisations Employee Voice; Employment Relations; Workplace This study explores how the implementation of government policy with respect to Indigenous voice practice impacts on the workplace participation of Indigenous employees in Vietnamese public sector organisations. A qualitative case study approach was adopted capturing the perspectives of managers and Indigenous employees in three public sector agencies. The findings showed that, while government policies have led to increased Indigenous workforce participation, there are a range of barriers at the organisational level that limit and undermine workplace participation. These include first, inconsistencies in the interpretation and implementation of these policies at the organisational level due to the reliance on the discretion of individual managers. Second, the lack of awareness and commitment or even underlying racism of non-Indigenous managers which was exacerbated by inconsistency in direct employee voice practices. Third, trade unions played a minor role in integrating Indigenous voice with collective voice. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

"Measuring digital inequality in Australia: The Australian digital inclusion index Digital Divide; Internet Use; Education In the past two decades digital inequality has come to be understood as a complex, evolving and critical issue in Australia, as it has elsewhere. This conceptual shift has generated demand for more complex measurement tools that can capture and combine multiple and graduated indicators of digital inequality. The Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII), developed in 2015 and now including annual data covering the period 2014 to 2018, is a composite index that addresses this demand. This paper describes the development of the ADII, its architecture and the dataset used to populate it. It also provides an overview of the findings of the 2018 edition of the index. The 2018 index reveals that, although on aggregate digital inclusion is improving in Australia, it continues to follow distinct geographic, social and socioeconomic contours. In general, rural and regional Australians, older Australians and Australians with low levels of income, employment, and education are less digitally included than their compatriots. For some of these groups the inclusion gap is widening."

"Evolving governance and contested water reforms in Australia's Murray Darling Basin Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water This paper explores the ways water governance adapts to changing social values and political imperatives by examining the case of water policy reforms in Australia's Murray Darling Basin. Over more than two decades, Australia's water reforms have explicitly aimed to promote ecological sustainability and economic efficiency, attempting to balance pro-market, micro-economic reforms with broader social and sustainability goals. Despite the formality of Australia's intergovernmental agreements, water reforms have been expensive and heavily contested, experiencing many implementation challenges. However, water market reforms have generally been regarded as successful, enabling the reallocation of water for environmental and extractive uses, contributing to flexibility and adaptive capacity. Recognising that discursive contestation is central to policy development, the paper documents the way the reform processes have attempted to broker compromises between three competing policy paradigms-national development, economic rationalism and environmentalism. These inherent tensions resulted in prolonged contests for influence over policy directions long after formal statements of policy intent by Governments. Given that climate change is driving the need for water governance reforms, the paper looks to what lessons can be learnt about the redesigns of meta-governance arrangements, including through structured commitments to independent audits and evaluations that can provide the feedback needed for adaptive governance and policy learning."
"The sociology of compensation inequality in upper-echelon positions: evidence from Australia Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence This paper explores the sociology of gender pay equality in leadership positions. Using a large compensation dataset, we examine the impact of gender pay inequality among directors and executives on firm performance. Based on a triangulation research design, quantitative outcomes are supplemented with semi-structured interviews to study compensation expectations, negotiation skills and gender differences in teamwork on boards of directors. The findings show that remuneration transparency is becoming the norm. However, compensation inequalities still exist and undermine performance. The results indicate that diversity targets or specific policies regarding equality and equity of opportunity are insufficient if they are not supported by a cultural understanding and the application of equitable policies and procedures throughout the organisation."

"Transnational education and an international partnership: A case study of a collaborative articulation program (cap) China; Internationalization Process; Student Mobility The growing internationalisation of education and cross border exchanges have brought along many benefits but, at the same time, given rise to tensions and many challenges. There are various models of partnership of transnational teacher education across borders which include twinning, franchising and campus structuring. The Collaborative Articulation Program (CAP) model is an initiative that emerged from the existing models of transnational education and became a strategy used by the Chinese government in their drive to build workforce capacity. Part of the agenda for economic and educational reforms in China, the utilisation of CAP partnerships with HE institutions, was established by mutual agreement to co-deliver joint programs. In this third section of the book, an in-depth study of a joint partnership of a Chinese and an Australian university is discussed. As there are limited studies with a focus on the model 2 + 2 CAP, the aim of this study is to detail the relationships and the nature of the experience from the point of view of the stakeholders, such as students, academics and policy makers. In this chapter the two plus two joint degree, CAP, and the approach to the dual degree program between the Australian and Chinese universities are described in terms of delivery modes, resources deployed, complexity, and contextual relevance of the curriculum. The sustainability of the CAP model is questioned."

"Innovation responses of Japanese firms to Chinese import competition Misallocation; China; Firm Heterogeneity This paper examines innovation responses of a panel of Japanese firms to the intensified import competition from China in the period 1995â€“2005. We build a comprehensive firm-level dataset linking patents and R&D merged to cross-industry measures of Chinese import competition. Accounting for a simultaneity bias between innovation and importing and the possible heterogeneous effects across firms, we found that patenting has increased in response to an influx of Chinese imports, but it has adversely affected the quality of innovation, measured by forward citations received. These effects are only observed for globally engaged firms, not for firms focusing on the domestic market."
"Towards Sustainable Environmental Quality: Priority Research Questions for the Australasian Region of Oceania Ethinylestradiol; Endocrine Disruptors; Wastewater Treatment Environmental challenges persist across the world, including the Australasian region of Oceania, where biodiversity hotspots and unique ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef are common. These systems are routinely affected by multiple stressors from anthropogenic activities, and increasingly influenced by global megatrends (e.g., the foodâ€“energyâ€“water nexus, demographic transitions to cities) and climate change. Here we report priority research questions from the Global Horizon Scanning Project, which aimed to identify, prioritize, and advance environmental quality research needs from an Australasian perspective, within a global context. We employed a transparent and inclusive process of soliciting key questions from Australasian members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. Following submission of 78 questions, 20 priority research questions were identified during an expert workshop in Nelson, New Zealand. These research questions covered a range of issues of global relevance, including research needed to more closely integrate ecotoxicology and ecology for the protection of ecosystems, increase flexibility for prioritizing chemical substances currently in commerce, understand the impacts of complex mixtures and multiple stressors, and define environmental quality and ecosystem integrity of temporary waters. Some questions have specific relevance to Australasia, particularly the uncertainties associated with using toxicity data from exotic species to protect unique indigenous species. Several related priority questions deal with the theme of how widely international ecotoxicological data and databases can be applied to regional ecosystems. Other timely questions, which focus on improving predictive chemistry and toxicology tools and techniques, will be important to answer several of the priority questions identified here. Another important question raised was how to protect local cultural and social values and maintain indigenous engagement during problem formulation and identification of ecosystem protection goals. Addressing these questions will be challenging, but doing so promises to advance environmental sustainability in Oceania and globally."

"Accelerated carbonation treatment of recycled concrete aggregates using flue gas: A comparative study towards performance improvement Carbonation; Carbon Dioxide; Curing (Nonfood Products) CO2 source is one of the limiting factors for popularizing the accelerated carbonation technology in recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) improvement. In this paper, the feasibility of using flue gas (CO2 content of 20 %) from cement plant as alternative CO2 source to improve RCAs was systematically studied and evaluated. Results showed that the carbonation extent and physical properties of the RCAs treated by flue gas were obviously improved and were comparable to those treated by commercial mixed gas with CO2 content between 20 % and 100 %. Based on the results of thermal gravimetric (TG), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, calcium hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrates in RCAs were significantly transformed into calcium carbonate at the optimal gas flow rate (5 L/min) after 168 h of treatment. The workability, compressive strength and flexural strength of concrete incorporating carbonated RCAs treated by flue gas were comparable with those treated by mixed CO2 gas, but were much better than those of concrete containing non-carbonated RCAs at all the replacement rate. Finally, the environmental impact and economic feasibility using flue gas to improve RCAs were evaluated based on a combined waste recycling system. All indicated that flue gas could be effectively utilized as CO2 source to improve RCAs."

"Tomographic Characterization of a Multifunctional Composite High-Impedance Surface Lamb Waves; Guided Electromagnetic Wave Propagation; Structural Health Monitoring The performance of a multifunctional composite high-impedance surface (HIS) has been evaluated using the coherent Doppler tomography (CDT) and finite-impulse response (FIR) filtering techniques. A combination of embroidery and advanced laser manufacturing processes were used to fabricate the conformable multifunctional glass fiber reenforced polymer HIS. The CDT method was utilized because it enabled the generation of a high-resolution tomographic map of the HIS reflectivity. Tomograms generated at high incidence angles (>80Â° from normal) were used to localize and FIR filter unwanted scattering associated with the ground plane edges and HIS transition regions. The resulting scattered fields from a defect (metallic block positioned in the center of the tomogram) were then used to gain a significantly distinctive insight into the HIS scattering properties. Furthermore, unlike traditional methods for characterizing HISs, the CDT and FIR methods presented herein are applicable to electrically large and conformal HISs."

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Blood Transfusion Services: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Radiological Findings; Clinical Features; COVID-19 Introduction: While SARS-CoV-2's main transmission route is through respiratory droplets, research has found that viral RNA could be detected in blood samples, causing concerns over the safety of blood donations and blood products. This paper therefore aims to systematically search for studies that have addressed their country's lack of donations and analyse the risk of blood transfusion-transmission. As such, it will answer the question ""should blood services focus more on donation vigilance or worry more about the risks of transmission through blood products?""Methods: 38 articles were identified through a systematic review adopting the PRISMA and STROBE guidelines. Meta-analysis was conducted using OpenMeta software. Results: The average decrease in blood donations was found to be 38%, with some regions showing up to 67% decrease. To assess the risk of actual blood transfusion-transmission, three datasets were analysed. Firstly, the viral load in COVID-19 patients was studied and found to have less than 1% detection rate (ARD = -0.831, 95% -0.963, -0.699). Secondly, the prevalence of finding viral RNA in a pool of donations was nearly -1.503 (ARD = -1.538, -1.468). Lastly, recipients who were given blood products of positive donors were found to be -0.911 (ARD 95% = -1.247, -0.575). Discussion/Conclusion: Blood centres should focus more on launching initiatives and policies that would increase their countries' blood supply as the virus has no direct threat to blood safety."
"A comparison of environmental impacts between rainwater harvesting and rain garden scenarios Bioretention Areas; Stormwater Management; Green Infrastructure Rain garden (RG) is a simple alternative to reduce pollutant loads carried through runoff. However, RG construction impacts the environment, where it demands evidence of net benefits generated once commissioned for operation. This study has simulated the reduction of runoff and pollutant loads due to the installation of RGs. Consequently, the reduction of the impacts on the environment was estimated using the LCA method. A comparison was carried out between the scenarios with and without RG with the most feasible (environmentally) rainwater harvesting (RWH) system. Three RG sizes are considered, such as 3, 4, and 6 m2 in dry, average, and wet annual rainfall conditions. The catchment-scale results showed that the runoff generation impacts of the RGs' operation phase were about (24â€“54%), (21â€“49%), (21â€“47%), and (14â€“45%) of the system without RG on eutrophication, human toxicity-carcinogenic, ecotoxicity-freshwater, and ecotoxicity-marine, respectively. However, once fabrication & installation were added, RG had much higher net impacts than without RG, except for eutrophication and ecotoxicity-freshwater. Hence, the net ecotoxicity-freshwater impact was lower for all scenarios except 4 and 6 m2 RG sizes during dry rainfall conditions. The most feasible RWH scenarios (e.g., 2000 & 3000 L tanks) had net impacts of 3â€“81% of the RG systems on global warming, human toxicity-carcinogenic, and ecotoxicity-terrestrial categories. On the other hand, RWH had net impacts of 105â€“200% on ozone depletion and eutrophication and 51â€“119% on the ecotoxicity-freshwater and ecotoxicity-marine of the RG systems."

"HomeSeeker: A visual analytics system of real estate data Transfer Of Learning; Multidimensional Data; Information Visualization In this paper, we present HomeSeeker, an interactive visual analytics system to serve users with different backgrounds of the local real estate market and meet different degrees of user requirements. As a result, HomeSeeker augments existing commercial systems to help users discover hidden patterns, link various location-centered data to the price, as well as explore, filter and compare the properties, in order to easily find their preferred properties. In particular, we make the following contributions: (1) We present a problem abstraction for designing visualizations that help home buyers analyse the real estate data. Specifically, our data abstraction integrates heterogeneous data from different channels into a location-centred integrated real estate dataset. (2) We propose an interactive visual analytic procedure to help less informed users gradually learn about the local real estate market, upon which users exploit this learned knowledge to specify their individual requirements in property seeking. (3) We propose a series of designs to visualize properties/suburbs in different dimensions and in different granularities. We have collected, integrated and cleaned last 10 year's real estate sold records in Australia as well as their location-related education, facility and transportation profiles, to generate a real multi-dimensional data repository, and implemented a system prototype for public access (http://115.146.89.158). At last, we present case studies based on real-world datasets and real scenario to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our system."

"A Trustworthy Privacy Preserving Framework for Machine Learning in Industrial IoT Systems Privacy Preserving; Randomized Response; Differential Privacy Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is revolutionizing many leading industries such as energy, agriculture, mining, transportation, and healthcare. IIoT is a major driving force for Industry 4.0, which heavily utilizes machine learning (ML) to capitalize on the massive interconnection and large volumes of IIoT data. However, ML models that are trained on sensitive data tend to leak privacy to adversarial attacks, limiting its full potential in Industry 4.0. This article introduces a framework named PriModChain that enforces privacy and trustworthiness on IIoT data by amalgamating differential privacy, federated ML, Ethereum blockchain, and smart contracts. The feasibility of PriModChain in terms of privacy, security, reliability, safety, and resilience is evaluated using simulations developed in Python with socket programming on a general-purpose computer. We used Ganache_v2.0.1 local test network for the local experiments and Kovan test network for the public blockchain testing. We verify the proposed security protocol using Scyther_v1.1.3 protocol verifier."

"Environmental management accounting in the Middle East and North Africa region: Significance of resource slack and coercive isomorphism Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is suffering from serious environmental issues, which are caused mainly by industrial and non-financial business activities. Implementing environmental management accounting (EMA) will help businesses manage environmental issues better and improve how they treat the environment. The key motivation for undertaking this study is that earlier research reported a poor level of environmental accounting practices by firms in the MENA region. These studies documented the necessity to develop a better understanding of EMA practices and the factors that influence their employment. Based on the new institutional sociology (NIS) perspective of institutional theory and resource slack theory, this study examines the influence of technological capabilities, environment-focused human resources management (EFHRM) and institutional isomorphism, specifically on the extent to which EMA practices are implemented in non-financial listed firms from eight MENA countries. These countries are Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan and Egypt. A web-based survey approach was utilised; and the data was analysed through structural equation modelling (SEM). The findings indicated an overall poor widespread of the use of EMA practices in the selected firms as perceived by the participants. Also, the findings suggest that technological capabilities, EFHRM and coercive isomorphism positively and significantly influence how EMA practices are implemented. Coercive pressures, technological and human resources are affecting the extent of EMA use in this study's sample, but not to a great extent. Hence, coercive pressures should be maximised by regulatory bodies in the selected MENA countries in order for EMA practices to be widely accepted. Furthermore, governments should facilitate the outsourcing of experts who can help with implementing EMA practices. It means collaborating with non-government partners, such as accounting associations, industry associations, research & consulting firms and educational institutions. These kinds of collaborations can lead to better support for environmental management and EMA, thus instituting the required educational programs and training to enhance employeesâ€™ awareness of EMA practices that include the role of technology."

"Exploring urban population forecasting and spatial distribution modeling with artificial intelligence technology Demography; Censuses; Americans The high precision population forecasting and spatial distribution modeling are very important for the theory and application of population sociology, city planning and Geo-Informatics. However, the two problems need to be solved for providing the high precision population information. One is how to improve the population forecasting precision of small area (e.g., street scale); another is how to improve the spatial resolution of urban population distribution model. To solve the two problems, some new methods are proposed in this contribution. (1) To improve the precision of small area population forecasting, a new method is developed based on the fade factor and the slide window. (2) To improve the spatial resolution of urban population distribution model, a new method is proposed based on the land classification, public facility information and the artificial intelligence technology. For validation of the proposed methods, the real population data of 15 streets in Xicheng district, Beijing, China from 2010 to 2016, the remote sensing images and the public facility data are collected and used. A number of experiments are performed. The results show that the spatial resolution of proposed model reaches 30m*30m and the forecasting precision is better than 5% using the proposed method to forecast the population of 15 streets in Xicheng district in the next four years."

"Organizational Learning from Prescribed Fire Escapes: a Review of Developments Over the Last 10 Years in the USA and Australia Fuel Treatment; Climate Change; Fire Severity Purpose of Review: Prescribed fire escapes continue to challenge most fire and land management agencies and many communities. This article considers the issue from knowledge management (KM) and organizational learning (OL) perspectives. We review organizational initiatives and the literature that have developed over the last 10 years to support learning from escaped prescribed fires, then use this to evaluate current learning practices and identify potential next frontiers for improving performance. Due to the difficulty obtaining statistics for non-federal entities, this review focuses primarily on developments in the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, but also captures reviews from the US Department of Interior, and the State of Victoria, Australia. Recent Findings: The recurring issue of prescribed fire escapes may in part be explained by the increasing challenges and expectations fire and land management agencies and prescribed fire managers face. Agencies are being asked to burn more area and suitably contain prescribed fires with fewer resources. In many jurisdictions, this challenge is heightened by increasingly tough climate conditions, shifting demographics internal and external to their agencies, changing patterns of land use, and requirements to meet increasing fuel reduction targets. A range of interventions has been developed and implemented by state and federal land and fire management agencies to support improved performance through KM and OL. However, prescribed fires continue to escape, often for the same reasons they always have, leading us to ask: is there a next frontier or level for improving performance though learning? Summary: This paper reviews recent developments in KM and OL to develop a model of organizational learning for prescribed fire. We then use this lens to review learning from prescribed burn escapes in Australia and the USA, highlighting the opportunities and challenges that agencies continue to face. Four areas of concentration to further strengthen OL are proposed, namely (i) strengthening the organizational learning culture, (ii) greater use of communities of practice to enhance lesson sharing, (iii) addressing the slow build time for prescribed burning expertise to replace pending retirements, and (iv) improving non-technical skills and human factors training."

"Bringing nature back into cities Urban Biodiversity; Urbanization; Birds Protecting nature is a fundamental aspect of local and Indigenous cultures that has more recently become an urban sustainability goal. The benefits provided by nature to people and other species have sparked an upsurge in research exploring how best to manage existing nature in urban environments. Here we expand this focus by drawing attention to an emerging pathway of research and practice that is engaged with the idea of bringing nature back into cities (BNB). We argue that BNB could be a vital force of the 21st century urban-sustainability agenda. However, the enthusiasm of practitioners and policymakers for incorporating BNB objectives into local and global strategies remains uneven. As interdisciplinary scholars involved with the theory and practice of caring for urban nature, we believe that the time is ripe to present a fresh perspective on seven key areas that can unlock the potential of actions to bring nature back into cities. Specifically, we: (a) argue that the sovereignty of local and Indigenous knowledge-systems be acknowledged and respected; (b) contend that the choice of bringing nature back actions should be driven by inclusive decision-making; (c) discuss advances in ecology that need to be addressed to facilitate the return of nature into cities; (d) outline how the diffusion of innovation theory may assist communication of BNB actions to stakeholders; (e) discuss how built-environment professionals can demonstrate the value of urban infrastructure for BNB; (f) call for longitudinal research to understand, quantify and qualify the benefits of BNB actions and (g) consider solutions needed to address concerns about potential risks and disservices associated with actions to bring nature back into urban environments. Taken together, these perspectives, and the transdisciplinary framework that emerges from them, embody theoretical innovation regarding how to bring nature back into cities and a holistic view of how to make this happen in practice. Bringing nature back into cities has the potential to become an environmentally just and culturally inclusive dimension of the 21st urban sustainability agenda upon which future generations of city-dwellers rely.

"Feasibility Study of Scale-up Options for the Production of Nanocrystalline Cellulose from Australian Rice Hulls RMIT and SunRice have been in recent discussions regarding the opportunity to value-add to rice hulls. One potential high value product identified has been nano-crystalline cellulose (NCC). Nanocrystalline cellulose is a fully biodegradable and biocompatible nano-material; as such it has attracted great attention in biomedical related applications. It has also found increasing applications in the areas of personal care, chemicals, foods, paper, medical science, pharmaceuticals, engineering materials, oil drilling, and biodegradable packaging film as well. Therefore, it is expected that the demand of NCC will continue to increase significantly in the near future.
RMIT has recently completed some preliminary studies on the production of NCC from rice hulls and, now in collaboration with SunRice, wishes to further develop an experimental program to collect and collate information to develop a business case for a pilot plant."

"Cohort profile: The Australian Longitudinal Study of Adults with Autism (ALSAA) Autism Spectrum Disorder; Asperger Syndrome; Coping Behavior Purpose There is a significant knowledge gap regarding the lives of adults on the autism spectrum. Some literature suggests significant health and mental health inequalities for autistic adults, yet there is a lack of comprehensive longitudinal studies exploring risk factors. Further, most research does not include the perspective of autistic adults in its conduct or design. Here, we describe the baseline characteristics and inclusive research approach of a nationwide longitudinal study. Participants The Autism Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism's Australian Longitudinal Study of Adults with Autism (ALSAA) is a questionnaire-based longitudinal study of autistic adults (25+ years old) with follow-up at 2-year intervals. Autistic advisors were involved in each stage of research apart from data analysis. Three questionnaires were developed: self-report, informant report (ie, proxy report) and carers (ie, carer experiences and characteristics). Findings to date An inclusive research protocol was developed and agreed with autistic advisors. Baseline data were collected from 295 autistic adults (M=41.8 years, SD=12.0) including 42 informant responses, 146 comparison participants and 102 carers. The majority of autistic participants (90%) had been diagnosed in adulthood (M=35.3 years, SD=15.1). When compared with controls, autistic adults scored higher on self-report measures of current depression and anxiety. Participant comments informed ongoing data gathering. Participants commented on questionnaire length, difficulty with literal interpretation of forced response items and expressed gratitude for research in this area. Future plans A large comprehensive dataset relating to autistic adults and their carers has been gathered, creating a good platform for longitudinal follow-up repeat surveys and collaborative research. Several outputs are in development, with focus on health service barriers and usage, caregivers, impact of diagnosis in adulthood, further scale validations, longitudinal analyses of loneliness, suicidal ideation, mental illness risk factors and other areas. Baseline data confirm poorer mental health of autistic adults. The ALSAA demonstrates a working approach to inclusive research."

"Defining HIV-1 Reservoirs in the Central Nervous System HIV-1 cannot be eradicated by combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) alone. The major obstacle to eradicating HIV-1 is the ability of intact and replication competent proviral DNA to persist latently in cellular reservoirs. Long-lived memory T cells are the best studied latent HIV reservoir, and virus from this reservoir will rebound when patients stop therapy. In addition to the T cell reservoir, there is considerable evidence demonstrating that HIV can also persist within tissues including the gut, lungs, kidneys, lymph nodes and potentially the central nervous system (CNS). Despite there being a significant and extensive knowledge base regarding HIV infection of the CNS and the development of neurological disorders in HIV infected viremic individuals, there is only a very limited understanding of the mechanisms of persistence in the CNS following viral suppression. Understanding the magnitude of intact and replication competent HIV-1 genomes within the CNS, and the cell types comprising the reservoir is paramount to the design of safe and effective eradication strategies. Our proposal will comprehensively characterise the CNS reservoir of HIV-1 using state-of-the-art novel in situ imaging approaches in clinically relevant human samples. These studies will provide conclusive information regarding the frequency, phenotype and anatomical location of HIV-infected cells and the magnitude of the CNS reservoir in relation to peripheral lymphoid compartments. Further, we will determine the proportion of the reservoir that contains intact genomes and the capacity of the virus to replicate and rebound, potentially leading to reseeding of infection."
"How do women entrepreneurs strategize growth? An investigation using the social feminist theory lens Migrant Workers; Self-Employment; Ethnic Business This paper explores the strategic success factors of fast-growth women entrepreneurs, explicating how their gendered strategies influence their growth paths. Drawing on social feminist theory, our qualitative study posits that a conscious choice of female perspective can be the central principle behind womenâ€™s entrepreneurial behavior and positively associated with growth. Our findings provide a more nuanced understanding of how women entrepreneurs weave together (economic) growth with personal and social outcomes, while shaping their key strategic success factorsâ€“client relationship and branding, organizational values and culture, networking behavior, and leadership and managementâ€“with female attributes and values attained through socialization."

"Educators' experiences and strategies for responding to ecological distress Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Climate Change; Skepticism Research is increasingly identifying the issues of ecological distress, eco-anxiety and climate grief. These painful experiences arise from heightened ecological knowledge and concern, which are commonly considered to be de facto aims of environmental education. Yet little research investigates the issues of climate change anxiety in educational spaces, nor how educators seek to respond to or prevent such emotional experiences. This study surveyed environmental educators in eastern Australia about their experiences and strategies for responding to their learners' ecological distress. Educators reported that their students commonly experienced feeling overwhelmed, hopeless, anxious, angry, sad and frustrated when engaging with ecological crises. Educators' strategies for responding to their learners' needs included encouraging students to engage with their emotions, validating those emotions, supporting students to navigate and respond to those emotions and empowering them to take climate action. Educators felt that supporting their students to face and respond to ecological crises was an extremely challenging task, one which was hindered by time limitations, their own emotional distress, professional expectations, society-wide climate denial and a lack of guidance on what works."

"What Drives Petrol Price Dispersion across Australian Cities? Price Dynamics; Price Dispersion; Asymmetric Pricing Petrol directly impacts the ability of and extent to which households can engage in day-to-day activities and ultimately directly influences the aggregate economic activity. Petrol price increases can lead to major economic disruption, especially among the most vulnerable, such as low-income families. In Australia, petrol prices differ substantially between metropolitan and regional areas, and regional drivers must pay more for purchasing petrol than those in capital cities. This research explored why retail petrol prices vary from one city to another within and between Australian regions. In this study, clustering methods and panel models will be used to identify factors that cause price differences. The findings revealed that a considerable part of the price differences arose from specific characteristics of cities that influence the demand and supply of petrol, thereby causing variations in price decisions. Petrol prices were substantially influenced by wholesale petrol prices, oil prices, petrol and diesel vehicles, population density, station density, and public transport accessibility. These factors are the main determinants that contribute significantly to price variations between Australian cities. The findings provide critical information for economic agents that interact in this market. From a social welfare perspective, government authorities can consider these factors to improve living standards and consumersâ€™ welfare under price pressure in regional cities."

"Digital Solutions for Resilient Cities: A Critical Assessment of Resilience in Smart City Initiatives in Melbourne, Victoria Smart Cities; Big Data; Internet of Things Urban resilience and smart cities have emerged as a critical agenda for urban development in the twenty-first century. The growing emphasis on smart and resilience concepts is mostly due to increasing shocks and stresses related to the environmental, economic, social, and technological pressures which is also exacerbated by the uncertainty associated with rapid urbanisation, climate change, and resource limitations. While digital smart solutions are becoming increasingly critical in addressing these challenges, it is essential to consider its broadest systemic impacts to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not created, and resilience compromised by adopting and using digital technologies in urban systems (Kupers, R., & Foden, M. (2017). Learning for resilience and complex systems thinking. Agenda setting scoping studies summary report. The Resilience Shift.) note â€œno complexity, no resilienceâ€ but conversely, it is also important to recognise that â€œsystems can fail, even if everything works as it is supposed toâ€. The aim of this paper is to investigate if the complexity drawn by introducing smart digital technologies in urban systems enhance resilience or create vulnerabilities? For this purpose, a deep case study analysis is conducted in Melbourne, Australia investigating the extent to which the current smart city initiatives contribute to the urban resilience attributes or have the potential to do so. Melbourne has dubbed as the most livable city in the world in several years and leads the nation as the most innovative city in Australia. Yet, despite its many efforts and relative wealth overall, the city faces risks and stresses that weaken the fabric of the society, which entrench disadvantage and may trigger the shocks of the future. Melbourne is exposed to natural disasters such as extreme heat, bushfires and floods, extremist acts, and of course the pandemics. There is an increasing number of smart city initiatives taking place in Melbourne, however, the extent to which these initiatives are aligned with the overall strategic plan of the city for resilience and sustainability objectives or just ad-hoc projects for testing new exciting technologies, is what we have investigated in this chapter. The significance and innovation of this chapter lie in its systematic examination of the contradictory promises, perils, and tensions of smart city solutions. This will facilitate incorporating resilience thinking in the design of smart city projects -to be optimised alongside traditional criteria like quality, cost, and avoid the potential risks of the smart solutions on city resilience."

"Bank risk in uncertain times: Do credit rationing and revenue diversification matter? Economic Policy Uncertainty; Macroeconomic Variables; China We show that bank risk rises, particularly for larger banks and those with greater interest-sensitive liabilities, during times of economic policy uncertainty through two economic channels: â€œcredit rationingâ€ and â€œrevenue diversification.â€ The credit rationing channel shows that economic policy uncertainty increases aggregate loan spreads, exacerbating both adverse selection and moral hazard problems leading to higher bank risk. The revenue diversification channel suggests that as economic policy uncertainty reduces bank profits from traditional interest-based products, banks diversify into other non-traditional activities, thereby increasing their instability. Overall, our findings highlight the impact of economic policy uncertainty on exacerbating bank risk."
"Attitudinal support for violence against women: What a population-level survey of the Australian community can and cannot tell us Intimate Partner Violence; Violence Against Women; Domestic Violence Violence against women (VAW) is a serious and prevalent problem globally. Societal-level norms, practices and structures are among the factors contributing to it, sometimes referred to collectively as representing â€œcultures of supportâ€ for VAW. Understanding factors contributing to these cultures is important for prevention, but remains the subject of debate. Population-level surveys of attitudes toward VAW are one means to strengthen this understanding. Although there are a number of such surveys internationally, scholarly research based on secondary analysis of data, at least from surveys in high-income countries, is scant. This article reports on new analyses of the Australian National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women survey to explore its potential to further empirical and conceptual understanding of cultures of support for VAW. To facilitate this, a scale to measure attitudes toward VAW was developed post hoc from the survey (the Violence Supportive Attitudes, or VSA-18, Scale). Subsequent analyses investigate the relationship between this scale and relevant demographic factors and a measure of attitudinal support for gender equality (GE). The GE measure, place of birth, employment and occupation, generation, education and sex contribute to variance in the VSA-18 Scale. Findings are discussed in the context of theoretical debates and directions for future research."

"A data-driven analytical roadmap to a sustainable 2030 in South Korea based on optimal renewable microgrids Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems Combined technological, economic, sociological, and environmental (TESE) models can play a unique role in leveraging renewable energies and supporting sustainable development. Yet, a multi-aspect TESE model has never been used in Korea to adapt to climate change through sustainable energy policies. This comprehensive TESE study addresses several sustainability challenges in the Korean energy sector. First, demand electricity is predicted using four deep and stacked neural networks to develop a smart demand-based model. Second, optimal hybrid renewable microgrids (HRMGs) are simulated at 17 sites to evaluate five renewable energy sources in three scenarios. Third, hybrid assessment results are clustered using a K-means algorithm to generate hybrid renewable energy maps for South Korea. Fourth, the TESE model is analyzed with more than 13 variables using a cascading multi-criteria decision-making approach to prorate a budget and develop a prioritized roadmap for a sustainable 2030 in Korea. Fifth, a stochastic linear mathematical model is developed to propose a sustainable energy policy that considers the water-energy-carbon nexus. The results show that a convolutional neural network can efficiently predict sequential demand electricity (R2 = 98.79%), with respective biogas, solar, hydrostatic, wind, and hydrokinetic energy fractions of 45.7%, 34.5%, 14%, 5.78%, and 0.01% under optimal conditions in Korea. The present free market-based policies are recommended to be revised in favor of domestic production of renewable energy facilities if new jobs can be created for more than $7500 each, and the carbon penalty cost can be kept below $83/ton CO2-eq in Korea."

"Global synthesis of conservation studies reveals the importance of small habitat patches for biodiversity Conservation Planning; Reserve Design; Environmental Protection Island biogeography theory posits that species richness increases with island size and decreases with isolation. This logic underpins much conservation policy and regulation, with preference given to conserving large, highly connected areas, and relative ambivalence shown toward protecting small, isolated habitat patches. We undertook a global synthesis of the relationship between the conservation value of habitat patches and their size and isolation, based on 31 systematic conservation planning studies across four continents. We found that small, isolated patches are inordinately important for biodiversity conservation. Our results provide a powerful argument for redressing the neglect of small, isolated habitat patches, for urgently prioritizing their restoration, and for avoiding simplistic application of island biogeography theory in conservation decisions."

"Printing approaches to inorganic semiconductor photocatalyst fabrication Microreactor; Continuous Flow; Batch Process Printing approaches to inorganic semiconductor photocatalyst fabrication potentially offer a simplified path to realising designer photocatalytic systems tailored to applications including water and air remediation, chemical synthesis, and renewable energy. Monoliths with controlled geometries, self-supporting foams, and microreactors, optimised for mass and photon transfer, unlock opportunities for improved photocatalytic efficiencies with better utilisation of low-abundance elements and energy resources. From a materials perspective, minimising material wastage through simplified single (or few) step fabrication processes is attractive for commercial exploitation. This review discusses conventional and emerging printing technologies and their application to photocatalytic materials and systems, highlighting key achievements and remaining knowledge gaps and challenges. Inkjet and extrusion printing are promising candidates for the fabrication of 3D patterned photocatalytic systems, although formulation aspects require further development. Printed photocatalytic foams are particularly interesting for the one-step fabrication of self-supporting photocatalysts. Further work is necessary to better understand and measure mass and photon transfer in complex 3D printed structures, wherein computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling may play an important role."

"Palm oil biomass global supply chain: Environmental emissions vs. technology development of maritime transportation Biomass; Supply Chain Design; Biomass Power To accomplish the climate-neutrality objective by 2050, it is necessary to increase the share of renewable energy sources globally. A significant portion of this burden should be carried by palm oil biomass. However, the palm oil biomass supply may not be large enough to satisfy the rising demand worldwide. International trade and maritime transportation networks may play a significant role in satisfying the objectives defined for biomass renewable energy worldwide. In this context, seaports play a major part in developing palm oil global biomass supply chains (GBSC). This study aims to fill the research gap by investigating the effects of ship technology developments (capacity and size), shipment distance, and mass flow of the palm oil GBSC on environmental emissions. To achieve this goal, a novel dynamic simulation model is developed and tested on two leading palm oil suppliers: Malaysia and Indonesia. The results show to what extent container ship technologies such as size and capacity would affect the environmental emissions in the next 30 years."

"Gender diversity on corporate boards, firm performance, and risk-taking: New evidence from Spain Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence Spain was the first European country to pass a â€Gender Equality Actâ€ to improve gender balance on corporate boards. Motivated by this vital development in Spanish law, we examine whether and how women directors play a role in influencing firm risk-taking and performance. We use 805 firm-year observations from 165 unique firms for 2013â€“2018. We find that firms with higher board gender diversity experience better accounting-based firm performance but lower market-based firm performance. Notably, our results show that firms with more female directors take higher risks, which puts a new insight into the long-standing tale that female directors are risk averse. Our results are robust with alternative measures of board gender diversity, performance and risk measures, alternative model specifications, and the two-step system GMM approach to address possible endogeneity. Our study context is, however, limited to Spain and does not account for female directorsâ€™ demographic and professional attributes due to the unavailability of relevant data. Despite these limitations, our research has important practical implications for policy and practice to enact a more gender-diverse board for better firm performance and risk management."
"Interaction and Coupling Mechanism between Recessive Land Use Transition and Food Security: A Case Study of the Yellow River Basin in China Rural Settlements; Land Consolidation; China The Yellow River Basin (YRB) plays an important role in Chinaâ€™s socioeconomic development and ecological security. From the perspective of recessive land use transition (RLUT), exploring the watershed food security (FS) coordination mechanism is of strategic significance to territorial space optimization and high-quality development. To this end, a coordinated evaluation system was built for analyzing the coupling coordination degree (CCD), spatiotemporal evolution characteristics, and driving mechanism between RLUT and FS of 74 cities in the YRB from 2003 to 2018, using methods such as the coupling coordination degree model, spatial autocorrelation analysis, and the geo-detector model. The results are as follows: (1) Spatial imbalance of RLUT and FS in the YRB is significant. RLUT has significant differences between east and west, and FS has significant differences between north and south. (2) From 2003 to 2018, the CCD between RLUT and FS increased from 0.6028 to 0.6148, maintaining a steady upward trend, and the cold and hot characteristics of spatial agglomeration are significant. (3) The CCD between RLUT and FS depends on population density, average annual temperature, and average elevation. The driving effect of natural factors is higher than the socioeconomic factors on the total basin scale, but the opposite is true on the sub-basin scale. Clarifying the spatiotemporal pattern, characteristics, and mechanism of the coupling and the coordination of RLUT and FS can provide a scientific basis for territorial space planning."
"Reflections on integrated research from community engagement in peatland restoration Indonesia; Swamp Forest; Biomass Burning Community engagement and integrated research are key approaches to solving complex socio-ecological challenges. This paper describes the experience of bringing together a team of natural and social scientists from Australia and Indonesia in the â€˜Gambut Kitaâ€™ (translated as â€˜Our Peatâ€™) project. Gambut Kita aims to produce new knowledge and support efforts to successfully, and equitably, restore Indonesiaâ€™s tropical peatlands and ensure that livelihoods can be maintained on restored (rewetted) landscapes. The paper focuses on experiences of using community engagement for integrated research. It discusses three community engagement approaches used in the projectâ€”resilience, adaptation pathways and transformation approach (RAPTA), participatory rural appraisal (PRA), and community-led analysis and planning (CLAP). It also describes the qualitative analysis of 14 interviews with the project team of lessons learned in community engagement for integrated research. â€˜Criteria for successâ€™ from the literature on international development projects is used to assess progress. The findings highlight the specific complexities of working across countries and cultures. Successful community engagement is not so much about the â€˜toolâ€™ but about the trust, agency, and support to change. The tools do, however, have different strengths. PRA and CLAP can build deep community understanding and relationships. RAPTA has strengths in framing visions and pathways to the future, systems thinking, anticipatory learning, and taking a cross-scale systems view which is required to solve many of the problems manifesting at local or community scales. Similarly, success in integrated research is not just about individuals, but structures (e.g. explicit process) and infrastructure (e.g. access to technology). These findings suggest that integrated research needs special considerations in terms of design, and these relate across scales to individual researchers as well as teams, leaders and organisations. Integrated research projects need careful, inclusive, iterative management with a lot of interaction to learn from each other, build a common vision, achieve clarity of roles, and share emerging findings."
"Transformable parallel-serial manipulator for robotic machining Machine Tool; Machining; Chatter Robotic manipulators have been conventionally used for position-controlled tasks such as pick-and-place, spray painting and arc welding, where the tools do not experience contact forces from external objects. In recent years, however, there is an increasing interest in using robotic manipulators to perform machining work, for e.g. drilling, polishing, deburring and milling. This is due to the greater dexterity of robots as compared to that of CNC machines (6 axes vs. 3 or 5 axes), as well as the lower cost of industrial manipulators. Nevertheless, in such machining applications, the object exerts external forces onto the tools and thus onto the robots, and robots would generally deflect because of their low joint and link stiffness. This deflection prevents the tools from cutting, drilling or milling the objects into the correct depth, and therefore the dimension of the machined object would not be accurate. In this paper, a novel design of robotic manipulator is proposed, which combines the advantages of both parallel and serial robots, and is suitable for machining applications. The manipulator acts as a stiff parallel manipulator when carrying out machining tasks, but transforms into a serial articulated manipulator when maneuvering through a large area. Experimental results show that the proposed manipulator has a higher stiffness than a serial manipulator of the same size, and that it outperforms conventional serial robots in carrying out machining work."

While traditional leather and its alternatives are sourced from animals and synthetic polymers, these renewable sustainable leather substitutes are obtained through the upcycling of low-cost agricultural and forestry by-products into chitinous polymers and other polysaccharides using a natural and carbon-neutral biological fungal growth process. Following physical and chemical treatment, these sheets of fungal biomass visually resemble leather and exhibit comparable material and tactile properties."
"Potential of Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis salina for nutrient and organic matter removal from municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) poses health and environmental risks on its disposal as it contains nutrients and harmful organic compounds at elevated concentrations. This study compared a freshwater microalga Chlorella vulgaris and a marine microalga Nannochloropsis salina in suspended and alginate-immobilised cultures for batch and semi-continuous treatment of the ROC. The immobilised algae gave comparable nutrient removal rates to the suspended cells, demonstrating immobilisation had no apparent negative impact on the photosynthetic activity of microalgae. Semi-continuous algal treatment illustrated that the microalgae could remove significant amounts of nutrients (> 50% and > 80% for TN and TP, respectively), predominantly through algal uptake (> 90%), within a short period (48 h) and generate 335â€“360 mg DCW L-1 d-1 of algal biomass. The treatment also removed a significant amount of organic matter (12.7â€“13.3 mg DOC L-1 d-1), primarily (> 65%) through the biotic pathway."
"Will happiness improve the psychological integration of migrant workers? Subjective Well-Being; Happiness; Life Satisfaction Happiness is a major factor that influences peopleâ€™s perceptions and behavior. Two-stage least squares regression was applied to investigate the effect of happiness on the psychological integration of migrant workers in China. The data for a total of 1625 individuals were obtained from the 2014 China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS). This study describes happiness from three main aspects: happiness, life satisfaction, and economic satisfaction. The psychological integration includes two dimensions of settlement willingness, and trust level; these have gone through dimension-reduced processing by using the weighted average method. The empirical evidence shows, first, that happiness has a significantly positive effect on the psychological integration of migrant workers and second, that the sense of life satisfaction in particular plays a more significant role. The acceleration of the social and political integration in migrant workers will enhance their psychological integration. Additionally, social, cultural and economic integration is found to influence migrant workersâ€™ psychological integration by promoting happiness. Happiness between different generations of migrant workers was found to have a noticeably positive impact on their psychological integration; however, the happiness of the younger migrant workers was more perceivable than that of the other generations. Preferential policies should therefore be provided to improve the happiness of migrant workers."

"Assessing the effectiveness for achieving policy objectives of land consolidation in china: Evidence from project practices in jiangsu province from 2001 to 2017 Land Consolidation; Agriculture; Cadastres Land consolidation (LC) is an important measure taken to increase the quantity and productivity of farmland while reducing land fragmentation and ensuring food security. However, long-term land consolidation project (LCP) practices are rarely analyzed to assess the effectiveness for achieving current policy objectives of LC in China. Taking the practices of LCPs in Jiangsu Province from 2001 to 2017 as a case study, we used the spatial self-related analysis, the consistency analysis, and the redundant analysis (RDA), and found that the construction scale and the investment amount of LC in Jiangsu Province displayed varying trends, and that the newly increased farmland rate is clearly divided into three stages and gradually decreases. The newly increased farmland area, the investment funds, and reserved land resources for farmlands are not spatially synchronized in Jiangsu Province. Only the positive relationship between the LC rate and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) growth rate continue to rise. The earlier stage of land consolidation projects (LCPs)â€™s practices is mainly affected by natural and social factors, and the late stage is mainly affected by economic and strategic factors. Finally, a new implementation scheme framework of LC planning has been proposed. This framework provides reference for top-level design, planning, and management of LC policies at the national level in China and other developing countries."

"Remote Sensing of Riparian Vegetation Condition The objective of the project is to attempt to use remote sensing to classify riparian vegetation condition across Melbourne Water's region and across time. The project will cover all riparian areas (24,000 km) throughout Melbourne Water's region. Melbourne Water uses a categorical system of rating riparian vegetation condition, ranging from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Melbourne Water needs to report to our stakeholders, with regard to our progress with implementing the Healthy Waterways Strategy in 2022 and 2026 showing the current riparian vegetation condition and the vegetation condition in comparison to 2018. This is of particular importance in high quality (e.g level 4 and 5) riparian vegetation areas. The focus of year 1 of this research project is to ascertain whether it is likely to be possible to build a model to assess vegetation condition across Melbourne Water's entire waterway network and across time."

"DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF RISKS ON SERVICE-ORIENTED SUPPLY CHAIN: A COVID-19 PANDEMIC PERSPECTIVE Disruption; Supply Chain Disruptions; Dual Sourcing Purpose - A solid service-oriented foundation is required to make supply chain management a competitive advantage, especially in this Covid-19 pandemic. A well-established service-oriented supply chain becomes more adaptable to changing client expectations. This study aims at analysing the direct and indirect impact of risks on the service-oriented supply chain from a pandemic perspective. Design/methodology/approach - The Q-sort method is applied with the participation of nine top-level managers to initially review the reliability, validity, and unidimensionality of research concepts. Then a questionnaire containing these measuring variables is developed to obtain the opinions of those who are experienced in logistics and supply chain management. These empirical data are analysed based on Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to evaluate direct and indirect effects of risks on supply chain performance. Findings - The risk is inherent in service-oriented supply chains, affecting both direct and indirect performance. The proposed risk model explains 33.6 percent of Supplier performance, 46.4 percent of Operational performance, 47.1 percent of Customer satisfaction, and 46.5 percent of Finance variation. We found that service-oriented supply chains effectively monitor demand risk. External risk has the smallest impact on supply chain performance measures, whereas demand risk has the smallest effect. That a service-oriented supply chain is focused on meeting customer demand and managing demand-related risks is reinforced by these findings. Research limitations/implications - In the literature on supply chain risk management, resilience studies and disruption management receive less attention than studies on risk assessment and risk mitigation (Katsaliaki et al., 2021). Future supply chain risk management research should differentiate between risk-as an event and/or risk-as a process since they have different periodic effects on response management and resilience. Originality/value - This is a pioneering study looking at the risk side of service-oriented supply chain. The data using in this research is from a large-scale survey supported by Japanese Government to promote ASEAN sustainable socio-economic development. This dataset collected during the Covid-19 pandemic to validate our models is an interesting and topical point of this study."

"Governing urban greening at a metropolitan scale: an analysis of the Living Melbourne strategy Urban Biodiversity; Urbanization; Birds As Australian cities face challenges of increased size, density and a range of environmental issues, compounded by climate change impacts, integration of greening is receiving increased attention. Greening, in the form of parks, gardens, waterways, water-sensitive designs and green roofs, contributes to liveability, sustainability and resilience, and habitat for non-human species. Local governments are responsible for the day-to-day management of much of Australiaâ€™s urban public spaces and are developing strategies for these areas. However, local-scale planning risks piecemeal, uncoordinated and ineffective approaches, particularly for biophysical systems that have little relationship with municipal boundaries. How can a metropolitan-scale approach be applied to green space planning and governance? This paper presents a case study of Living Melbourne metropolitan urban forest strategy, developed by Nature Conservancy and Resilient Melbourne. Resilient Melbourne brings together Melbourneâ€™s 32 local governments to plan and advocate at the metropolitan scale. While the Living Melbourne strategy provides a metropolitan-scale approach, questions of governance, including how the strategy will be implemented and how local context is understood, are highlighted. Further, in developing a metropolitan-scale approach, how are the voices of local communities included? The paper analyses who is governing Melbourneâ€™s urban greening, and the benefits and risks of a metropolitan-scale approach."

"Energy poverty and retirement income sources in Australia Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort In many countries population ageing will increase the share of retirees in the coming years. Energy poverty is a particular problem for older people (due to fixed and often relatively low incomes and the need for additional energy due to underlying health conditions). This can have cost implications for the healthcare sector if the health of older people deteriorates due to energy poverty. The burden of population ageing and the increasing dependency ratio has meant the government is moving towards individuals funding their own retirement via compulsory superannuation schemes. Our study is based in Australia where there is a difference in retirement income sources between publicly funded Age Pensioners, Part-pensioners and Self-Funded Retirees leading to differences in energy poverty beyond income effects. Using 15 annual waves of the HILDA survey from 2005 to 2019, this study investigates drivers of energy poverty inequalities among retirees. Our main finding is that Age Pensioners are the worst off and Self-Funded Retirees the best off on a Low Incomeâ€“High Cost measure of energy poverty and on a subjective indicator of inability to heat the home. Therefore, not all retirees have the same probability of experiencing energy poverty. However, wealth, assets, social connections and good health are significant mediators that soften the impact of subjective concerns regarding energy bills for retirees. Government-funded pensions are a safety net and need to be sufficient in times of energy price inflation. Moreover, we need to reduce the gap between state-funded pensions and self-funding arrangements to ensure equity in elderly populations."

"Innate immune responses to malaria-infected erythrocytes in pregnant women: Effects of gravidity, malaria infection, and geographic location Malaria; Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1; Plasmodium Falciparum Background: Malaria in pregnancy causes maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, and maternal innate immune responses are implicated in pathogenesis of these complications. The effects of malaria exposure and obstetric and demographic factors on the early maternal immune response are poorly understood. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses to Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes and phytohemagglutinin were compared between pregnant women from Papua New Guinea (malaria-exposed) with and without current malaria infection and from Australia (unexposed). Elicited levels of inflammatory cytokines at 48 h and 24 h (interferon Î³, IFN-Î³ only) and the cellular sources of IFN-Î³ were analysed. Results: Among Papua New Guinean women, microscopic malaria at enrolment did not alter peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses. Compared to samples from Australia, cells from Papua New Guinean women secreted more inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factorÎ±, interleukin 1Î², interleukin 6 and IFN-Î³; p<0.001 for all assays, and more natural killer cells produced IFN-Î³ in response to infected erythrocytes and phytohemagglutinin. In both populations, cytokine responses were not affected by gravidity, except that in the Papua New Guinean cohort multigravid women had higher IFN-Î³ secretion at 24 h (p = 0.029) and an increased proportion of IFN-Î³+ VÎ´2 Î³Î´ T cells (p = 0.003). Cytokine levels elicited by a pregnancy malaria-specific CSA binding parasite line, CS2, were broadly similar to those elicited by CD36-binding line P6A1. Conclusions: Geographic location and, to some extent, gravidity influence maternal innate immunity to malaria."
"On the relationship between the circumference of rubber trees and L-band waves Scattering; Synthetic Aperture Radar; RADARSAT Despite substantial research conducted within the forestry domain, detailed assessments to monitor plantations and support their sustainable management have been understudied. This article attempts to fill this gap through coupling fully polarimetric L-band data and contemporary data mining methods for the estimation of tree circumference as: (1) a primary dataset for biomass accumulation studies; and, (2) critical information for operational management in rubber plantations. We used two rubber plantation sites in Subang (West Java) and Jember (East Java), Indonesia, to evaluate the capability of L-band radar data. Although polarimetric features derived from polarimetric decomposition theorems have been advocated by others, we show that backscatter coefficients, especially HV polarization, remain an important dataset for this research domain. Using Subang data to build the model, we found that modern machine learning methods do not always deliver the best performance. It appears that the data being ingested plays a significant role in obtaining a good model, hence careful selection of datasets from multiple forms of polarimetric SAR data needs to be further considered. The highest coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.79) was achieved by Yamaguchi decomposition features with the aid of partial least squares regression. Nonetheless, we note that the R2 gap was insignificant to the backscatter coefficient when random forests regression was used (R2 = 0.78). Overall, only the backscatter coefficient dataset delivered fairly consistent results with any regression model, with the average R2 being about 0.67. When tuning parameters were not assessed, random forests consistently outweighed support vector regressions in all forms of datasets. The latter generated a substantial increase in R2 when a linear kernel was used instead of the popular radial basis function. The issue of transferability of the model is also addressed in this article. It appears that similarity of terrain characteristics substantially influences the modelâ€™s performance. Models developed in Subang, which has gentle slopes, seem valid only in plantations with similar terrain. Validation attempts in very flat terrain within two plantation sectors in Jember delivered a poor result, although they have similar elevations to the Subang site. In contrast, validation in a plantation sector with similar, gently sloping terrain achieved an R2 of about 0.6 using some datasets."

"Personality and pay: Do gender gaps in confidence explain gender gaps in wages? Locus of Control; Labour Market; Personality Traits This study explores whether gender patterns in personality traits contribute to the gender gap in hourly wage rates, focusing on traits that reflect an individual's confidence to take on a challenge. To capture confidence, we use a psychological measurement known as Achievement Motivation, which is dually comprised of 'hope for success' and 'fear of failure'. This personality dimension is examined in addition to the Big Five personality traits and Locus of Control (LOC). Using 2013 wage data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, our Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition model reveals that men's stronger hope for success, lower fear of failure and lower agreeableness contribute to the gender wage gap, while women's higher level of conscientiousness is the only trait that serves to narrow it."

"Conceptualizing post-covid-19 malaysia’s tourism recovery: An auto-regressive neural network analysis Tourist; Destination Image; Risk Perception The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) has significantly affected the tourism industry. Tourist destinations have adopted emergency measures and restrictions that have affected the mobility of individuals around the world. This study aims to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism industry in Malaysia and its overall economic performance. This research used an extensive set of statistical tests, including a newly constructed AutoRegressive Neural Network-ADF (ARNN-ADF) test, to determine if foreign visitor arrivals from 10 main source markets in Malaysia will revert to normal. Secondary data from various government published sources were used in this conceptual methodology technique for this study. Based on the research results and exploratory research of the literature, we listed in a synthesizing manner several measures to ensure the resilience of the tourism sector during the COVID-19 pandemic period. This research makes a significant contribution to the literature in terms of validating a new framework that emphasizes the effects of tourists that are largely transitory. In conclusion, this conceptual study will further help the authorities to take precautions and the best policy to be implemented in the future."

"Connecting survivors to therapeutic support and criminal justice through informal reporting options: an analysis of sexual violence reports made to a digital reporting tool in Australia Sexual Assault; Rape; Victims This article analyses the content of 483 reports of sexual violence, including rape, sexual assault, child sexual abuse and various forms of sexual harassment, made to a digital reporting tool (DRT) developed by a rape crisis centre in Melbourne, Australia. These written digital reports were made in a confidential and informal capacity, with all de-identified reports distributed to relevant policing jurisdictions to support intelligence gathering. Based on an analysis of the de-identified reports, this article suggests the DRT functioned as an important gateway in connecting survivors with appropriate therapeutic support when disclosing sexual violence and had a demonstrable capacity to provide the police with information for intelligence gathering. There was also scope for survivors to make formal reports should they wish to do so. However, further research with police, sexual violence support services and survivors is needed to develop a full understanding of the potential of informal sexual violence reporting options."

"Government efforts and roadmaps for building information modeling implementation: lessons from Singapore, the UK and the US Information Modeling; Facilities Management; Construction Industry Purpose: The government plays a critical role in driving building information modeling (BIM) implementation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the government efforts for driving BIM implementation in three benchmark countries, namely, Singapore, the UK and the US, so as to develop appropriate roadmaps for increasing BIM implementations in other countries. Design/methodology/approach: This study performs a review on the government efforts and roles in BIM implementation in three benchmark countries, namely, Singapore, the UK and the US. Findings: Through cross comparison with existing literature, it is found that Singapore and the UK adopt a government-driven approach and a phase-by-phase development pattern is observed. The first phase focuses on the building sector to rapidly increase the use of BIM and the government generally plays the role of an initiator. In the second phase, BIM is expanded to other implementation areas, e.g. smart city. The importance of the initiator role decreases and more attention is paid to supporting roles such as researcher, educator and regulator. In contrast, an industry-driven approach is adopted in the US. The main role of the government is that of a regulator, with research institutions actively supporting the BIM implementation. Research limitations/implications: General roadmaps of the two mandating approaches are presented. The results can provide a useful reference for countries and regions that intend to develop roadmaps to increase their BIM maturity level and enhance readiness to accept and implement BIM. Originality/value: This study is one of the first studies that investigate the step-by-step roadmaps for implementing BIM from the perspective of changing government roles."

"Immersive cartography and post-qualitative inquiry: A speculative adventure in research-creation Education; Posthuman; Materialist Immersive Cartography and Post-Qualitative Inquiry introduces immersive cartography as a transdisciplinary approach to social inquiry in an age of climate change and technological transformation. Drawing together innovative theories and practices from the environmental arts, process philosophy, education studies, and posthumanism, the book frames immersive cartography as a speculative adventure that gradually transformed the physical and conceptual architectures of a university environment. The philosophical works of Alfred North Whitehead, Gilles Deleuze, and Felix Guattari are touchstones throughout the book, seeding the development of concepts that re-imagine the university through a more-than-human ecology of experience. Illustrated by detailed examples from Rousell's artistic interventions and pedagogical experiments in university learning environments, the book offers new conceptual and practical tools for navigating the ontological turn across the social sciences, arts, and humanities. Rousell's wide-ranging and detailed analysis of pedagogical encounters resituates learning as an affective and environmentally distributed process, proposing a ""trans-qualitative"" ethics and aesthetics of inquiry that is orientated toward processual relations and events. As a foothold for a new generation of scholarship in the social sciences, this book opens new directions for research across the fields of post-qualitative inquiry, art and aesthetics, critical university studies, affect theory, and the posthumanities."

"Institutional betrayal and sexual harassment in STEM institutions: evidence from science and technology universities of Ethiopia Sexual Harassment; Workplace; Sexism In this paper, we examine the experiences of female students and academics to understand the factors that underpin the persistence of sexual harassment in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) institutions. We draw on data from interviews and focus group discussions with female students and academics who participated in a study that focuses on gender inequality in science and technology universities in Ethiopia. Drawing on the concept of institutional betrayal, we argue that the high prevalence of sexual harassment in these universities is perpetuated by institutional actions and inactions through which universities fail to proactively prevent and effectively respond to sexual harassment. We suggest efforts to tackle sexual harassment need to focus on proactive and preventive measures that involve revisiting institutional policies and structures. We further suggest that grievance procedures need to be accessible, responsive, trustworthy and supportive."

"Host cell kinome as a target for the treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection SARS-CoV-2 is a major public health challenge. There are no effective treatments and the impact on the public health systems, including in all Australian states, is unprecedented in living memory.
Viruses rely on host cell signalling pathways for their replication. We will identify key host cell signalling proteins activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection and validate their potential as targets for curative drugs. This project will establish synergistic cooperation between two Victorian research institutions with complementary capabilities/expertise: RMIT University (kinomics of infectious systems) and Melbourne Health/Doherty Institute (SARS-CoV-2 cell and molecular biology).
Our innovative approach to prevent viral replication by inhibiting human signalling enzymes opens a new avenue in anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery, based on untapped targets that will offer low propensity for resistance. This strategy overcomes two major problems that impairs anti-infective drug development:
(i) Drug resistance. Targeting human enzymes deprives the virus of the fastest mechanism for drug resistance, namely the selection of mutated resistant targets.
(ii) Targeting host-cell kinases opens the well-funded cancer drug discovery pipeline to antiviral drug development. Inhibitors that are already approved for use in humans can be rapidly progressed to clinical trails and repurposed as a treatment for SARs-CoV-2 infection."
"From Descriptive to Accurate Horseshoe Crab Size Variations in Wild Populations Horseshoe Crabs; Tachypleus Tridentatus; Carcinoscorpius Horseshoe crabs have survived until Holocene, but their persistence beyond the Anthropocene is challenged by drastic environment changes that entail impoverishments and the resultant unusual growth sizes. Previously, allometry via morphometric ratio was introduced to classify horseshoe crabs into normal-abnormal growth. However, the descriptive size and weight analysis indicated a considerable portion of Tachypleus gigas with normal allometry. This error was caused by the median sorting of values. Therefore, the same data was treated with correlation before generating a linear equation. By being sexual dimorphs, these arthropods actually have gender-specific morphology indicators which could generate a functional allometry. Since the assessed arthropods were mature, the 19 % yield of smaller female T. gigas was possibly due to degradation effects from poor diets or stress. Yet, for this population, an added risk was female-only harvest. Perhaps, close sizing to male counterparts could be perceived a survival strategy by the female T. gigas. More evidence is needed to strengthen this opinion but for now, this assessment method is novel for accurate allometry assessments in the species with sexual dimorphism. Overall, capture fisheries could have negative impacts and when made severe by sex-specific harvest, the unaccounted practices could collapse sustaining populations."
"Benevolent and hostile sexism differentially predicted by facets of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation Social Dominance Orientation; Authoritarianism; Political Attitudes Despite progress towards equality on many fronts, sexism remains a problem. If sexism is to be combatted, an understanding of the attitudes underlying its various expressions is required. Previous research has strongly linked sexism to right-wing authoritarianism (a preference for collective security) and social dominance orientation (a preference for group-based hierarchy). Both are often considered unitary constructs, however recent attention to their facets has revealed finer details. This study breaks ground by utilising these facets to predict benevolent sexism (paternalistic attitudes towards women) and hostile sexism (antipathy towards women) in an Australian sample (N = 229). Both sexism variables were significantly predicted by two of the five attitude facets. For benevolent sexism, these were traditionalism and dominance, and for hostile sexism, they were conservatism and anti-egalitarianism. Hostile sexism was also predicted by gender. These findings add to the theoretical understanding of ambivalent sexism, have implications for addressing sexism in society, and support calls for future research to utilise the facets of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation."
"Examining the use of local government rate rebates for encouraging conservation in rapidly developing peri-urban areas The natural heritage values of peri-urban areas are under increasing threat from urban encroachment and development. Some private landholders elect to protect natural values on their land by entering into voluntary permanent protection agreements (covenants) with land trusts and government agencies, foregoing their rights to development and helping to retain the natural values of peri-urban areas. Preliminary discussions with industry (land trusts) and landholders have indicated that some local governments are highly supportive of these agreements, providing rebates and discounts on council rates for participating landholders, as a reward for their conservation commitment and an incentive for other landholders to sign up to a conservation covenant. Yet, other councils provide little or no support in terms of rate rebates. Why this discrepancy exists is currently unclear. "
"Urban forest governance and decision-making: A systematic review and synthesis of the perspectives of municipal managers Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Empirical research on the views of municipal managers can provide insights into urban forest governance and decision-making. However, current research is fragmented across a diversity of case studies using a variety of methods. To address this issue, we undertook a systematic review and synthesis of empirical studies based on the views of municipal managers. We extracted information on the concerns, priorities, factors, and actors that influence municipal manager decision-making using a governance framework to extract ideas on the discourses, actors, rules, and resources that influence their decision-making. Out of >1400 articles found in searches, only 60 were relevant empirical studies, with 32 of them based in the US. Most studies elicited views from managers using pre-determined surveys/questionnaires. This literature is focused heavily on themes of resources, such as budgets and personnel, as important influences in program performance and urban forest success. Themes related to coordination of actors, such as the coordination of departmental units, were also frequently mentioned but were not explicitly associated with program performance or urban forest success. Future research aimed at gaining insights on urban forest governance and decision-making from the perspective of municipal managers will benefit from distinguishing operational capacities (i.e., budgets, personnel) from management processes (i.e., coordination), and focus on how municipal managers understand, facilitate, and find support in management processes. This will reveal how they implement co-governance and collaborative decision-making. Future research could better extend the knowledge base of existing studies by establishing clear governance frameworks and methods based on the views of managers."

"Fast analysis of multiple haloacetic acids and nitrosamines in recycled and environmental waters using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with positive-negative switching and multiple reaction monitoring Disinfection; Haloacetic Acids; Chlorodibromomethane Disinfection by-products, such as haloacetic acids and nitrosamines, are toxic compounds that commonly occur in chemically treated water. They are formed through reactions between chemical disinfectants and both natural and anthropic organic matter. Levels of disinfection by-products in drinking water are regulated worldwide due to their known health effects, making their continued, fast and accurate analysis very important. Monitoring is particularly significant in areas that practise augmentation of potable water with recycled sources such as Namibia and Singapore. Disinfection by-products come in many forms and the analysis of different groups is typically undertaken separately, each requiring different extraction and separation techniques. Both gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography may be used and, in both cases, USA EPA and ISO methods exist in addition to methods published in scientific journals. In this study a new method is presented that utilises liquid chromatography hyphenated triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with positive-negative switching within a single run. This approach allows for the analysis of 11 compounds, (5 haloacetic acids and 6 nitrosamines), within 6 minutes. Limits of detection were 0.05-0.1 parts per billion (Î¼g L-1). The method significantly speeds up the analysis time for disinfection by-products, removes the need for extraction and preconcentration, and may have benefits for the water and environmental industries amongst others."

We propose a statistical algorithm for long-term prediction of an extinction event in the paradigmatic predatorâ€“prey model. The algorithm is based on noisy and sporadic observations of the Lotkaâ€“Volterra (LV) system at the early stages of its evolution, when the system is still very far from extinction. There are two stages in the algorithm: first, the unknown parameters (reaction rates) of the LV system are estimated using the Approximate Bayesian Computation method; then an analytical expression for the time-scale of extinction (which involves the estimated parameters) is applied to compute the probability density function of extinction time. The proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations for the case of a stochastic LV system specified by the birthâ€“death rate equations. The algorithm can be seen as an initial step in the quest for long-term prediction of rare â€œcatastrophicâ€ events in complex stochastic dynamic systems (epidemics, host-parasite dynamics, enzyme kinetics, dynamic trading, etc.)."

"Dual stage control of a servo system consisting of a piezoelectric actuator and a linear motor for electrical discharge machining Electric Discharge Machining; Wire; Tool Wear Gap width is the most important factor that affects the stability of the electrical discharge machining (EDM) process, material removal rate and surface finish of the workpiece. This research is to develop a new hybrid positioning system which consists of a linear servo motor and a piezoelectric actuator (PZT) for high efficiency EDM processes. In this new system, the servo motor provides the macro feeding for the workpiece while the PZT feeds the workpiece in micro scale at high frequency. To reduce the delay caused by separate movements of the linear motor and PZT, a new control algorithm was developed to synchronize the movements of both the motor and PZT. Cutting experiment shows that an increase in MRR of 1.5 times was achieved by using the proposed algorithm."

"Substrate-to-inoculum ratio drives solid-state anaerobic digestion of unamended grape marc and cheese whey Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production Inoculation dose is a key operational parameter for the solid-state anaerobic digestion (SSAD) of lignocellulosic biomass, maximum methane recovery, and stable digester performance. The novelty of this study was the co-digestion of unamended full-strength grape marc and cheese whey for peak methane extraction at variable inoculation levels. An acclimatised digestate from a preceding anaerobic treatment was used as a downstream inoculum. The impact of inoculum size (wet weight) was evaluated at 0/10, 5/5, 7/3 and 9/1 substrate-to-inoculum (S/I) ratios, corresponding to an initial concentration of 20-30% total solids (TS) in digesters over 58 days at 45Â°C. The optimal 7/3 S/I produced the highest cumulative methane yield, 6.45 L CH4 kg-1 VS, coinciding with the lowest initial salinity at 11%; the highest volumetric methane productivity rate of 0.289Â±0.044 L CH4 LWork -1 d-1; the highest average COD/N ratio of 9.88; the highest final pH of 9.13, and a maximum 15.07% elemental carbon removal; for a lag time of 9.4 days. This study identified an optimal inoculation dose and opens up an avenue for the direct co-digestion of grape marc and cheese whey without requirements for substrate pretreatment, thus improving the overall bioenergy profile of the winery and dairy joint resource recovery operations."
"Treatment of wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate using alginate-immobilised microalgae: Integrated impact of solution conditions on algal bead performance Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Alginate can be used for entrapment of microalgal cells in gel beads to achieve high-rate treatment of wastewater and can overcome the difficulties of cell separation that would occur in suspended microalgae treatment systems. The potential for alginate beads to disintegrate in the presence of high ion concentrations could limit the use of alginate entrapment for treating municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC). The combined effect of the pH, alkalinity, and salinity of the ROC that impact the physical stability, chemical characteristics, biomass production, and nutrient removal performance of alginate-entrapped Chlorella vulgaris for treating the ROC was investigated. Water adsorption resulting from the loss of calcium from the alginate matrix was the initiating cause of reduction of the algal bead stability. The combination of alkalinity >400 mg/L and pH â‰¥9.5 led to a >65% reduction in compressive strength and thus disintegration of beads during ROC treatment. However, alginate beads of C. vulgaris were sufficiently stable and were capable of nutrient remediation (up to 100% TP and 85% TN per treatment cycle of 48 h over a 10-day period) and biomass production (up to 340 mg/L/d) when salinity, pH, and alkalinity levels were <8 g TDS/L, 7â€“9.5, and <400 mg/L, respectively. Empirical models that were developed and validated could enable the prediction of the performance of the algal beads for various ROC compositions. This study enhances the insight and decision-making regarding the feasibility of the alginate-immobilised microalgal system for treating municipal wastewater ROC streams."

"How do development actors do “ICT for development”? A strategy-as-practice perspective on emerging practices in Ghanaian agriculture Cell Phone Use; Market Information; Agriculture This paper examines how development actors within the Ghanaian agricultural sector enact information and communication technology (ICT) in their day-to-day outreach practices with smallholder farmers. We draw on an in-depth qualitative case study, informed by the theoretical perspective of â€œstrategy-as-practiceâ€ to answer the research question: â€œwhat ICT-mediated strategic practices are used by development actors in the Ghanaian agriculture sector?â€ The research findings reveal that (1) the activities of development actors are meshed within a network of interdependencies; (2) the enacted strategic practices reflect the trade-off between novelty of content and novelty of the technologies used to deliver it; and lastly, (3) the praxis of development actors for doing ICT for development consists of hybrid strategies, combining bottom-up approaches consistent with farmers' indigenous smallholder logic, with top-down imperatives framing agriculture â€œas a businessâ€ and nurturing value-chain integration. Consequently, our research points to the impact of ICT initiatives as step-wise and attained over the long term, rather than disruptive and attained in the immediate term."

"City Engine Project Urban infrastructure and systems (for example energy, transportation, telecommunications and water) are highly interdependent on each other to operate. Climate change and extreme weather events such as flash flooding, heatwaves, drought and bushfires are generating far-reaching flow-on effects across these systems. Many of these systems are privately owned and there is not a coordinated approach to mitigating the impacts of climate change on these systems. Identifying the interdependencies is the first step to bringing together government and private agencies to have an integrated approach to adaptation strategies.

Through this work, the City of Melbourne and its stakeholders will develop a better understanding of Melbourne’s urban system vulnerabilities, and develop improved methodologies for mapping urban system interdependencies.
Professor Rickards will work with City of Melbourne and its partners to lead this work."

"The effect of maritime knowledge clusters on maritime firms’ performance: An organizational learning perspective Alliance Portfolios; Firm; Open Innovation Maritime Knowledge Clusters are known to facilitate regional economic growth. Nevertheless, few studies have been conducted to examine their impact on maritime firmsâ€™ performance. Drawing on organizational learning theory, this study investigates the effect of maritime knowledge clusters on the constituent maritime firmsâ€™ performance. A conceptual model was proposed and examined using survey data collected from shipping professionals in Singapore. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were employed as the data analysis approach. The results show that the positive relationship between maritime knowledge clusters and maritime firmsâ€™ performance is fully mediated by the firmsâ€™ social capital and absorptive capacity in a sequential manner. This indicates that maritime firms should focus on strengthening not only their social capital but also absorptive capacity so as to fully enjoy the benefits brought about by maritime knowledge clusters. In addition, regulators should endeavor to develop global linkage, global systemic mechanisms and local knowledge clusters to facilitate organizational learning of the constituent maritime firms."
"Professionalisation and the spectacle of nature: Understanding changes in the visual imaginaries of private protected area organisations in Australia Payments For Ecosystem Services; Payment; China Imaginaries of protected areas as state-based fortresses have been challenged by expansion of the global nature conservation estate on non-government lands, notably in contexts such as Australia where neoliberal reform has been strong. Little is known about the implications of this change for the meanings, purposes and practices of nature conservation. Images are central to public understandings of nature conservation. We thus investigate the visual communication of environmental non-government organisations (ENGOs) involved in private protected areas in Australia, with particular focus on Bush Heritage Australia (BHA). We employ a three-part design encompassing quantitative and qualitative methods to study the visual imaginaries underlying nature conservation in BHA's magazines and the web homepages of it and four other ENGOs over 2004â€“2020. We find that visual imaginaries changed across time, as ENGOs went through an organisational process of professionalisation comprising three dynamics: legitimising, marketising, and differentiating. An imaginary of dedicated Western volunteer groups protecting scenic wilderness was replaced by the spectacle of uplifting and intimate individual encounters with native nature. Amenable to working within rather than transforming dominant political-economic structures, the new imaginary empowers professional ENGOs and their partners as primary carers of nature. It advertises a mediated access to spectacular nature that promises positive emotions and redemption for environmental wrongs to financial supporters of ENGOs. These findings reveal the role of non-government actors under neoliberal conditions in the use of visual representations to shift the meanings, purposes and practices of nature conservation."

"Measuring the inequality of accessible trams in Melbourne Public Transport; Accessibility; Transit In Melbourne, public policy has recently been enacted to improve access to the tram service with an emphasis upon people with a disability. Achieving that objective requires two elements. One is a low-floor tram and two is an elevated tram stop platform that facilitates boarding the tram. Currently the fleet of trams in Melbourne is made up of high-floor and low-floor designs, thus accessible services are unevenly distributed. In addition, construction of new tram stop platforms has been uneven. This suggests a form of inequality in accessible tram services for the disabled. Several studies of transport services have addressed this issue using the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve calculations as seen in studies of disadvantaged groups such as the elderly. This research utilizes those approaches to estimate the current access of the disabled population to trams services in Melbourne. The approach compares the geography of the total and accessible tram services with the geography of the total and disabled population using the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve. The results show that there is inequality in the accessible trams amongst people with a disability in Melbourne (Gini = 0.66) as 70% of the disabled population has access to only 22% of the accessible tram supply. In comparison, considering the total tram supply and the entire population, (Gini = 0.48) 70% of the population shares 40% of the tram supply. Hence, at this stage the provision of accessible tram services for people with a disability falls well below that of the general population. These results provide an insight into the current tram service inequality and can be used as a reference for future tram system investment. Further, the approach could be used to increase awareness of this matter and encourage an inclusive and sustainable public transport planning and development in both local and global contexts."

"Competition and choice as a guiding principal for housing service reforms: The views of Australian housing professionals Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Amongst the claims often made to justify contemporary housing reforms in Australia is that extending choice and opening services to competition will lead to improved outcomes for tenants and encourage service agencies to become more efficient. This paper considers the veracity of â€˜choiceâ€™ and â€˜competitionâ€™ based reforms by drawing on international examples and the views of practitioners working in the Australian housing sector. Situating Australian reforms in an international context it explores why some practitioners have misgivings about policies that seek to advance â€˜choiceâ€™ as the guiding principal for housing reform. The key arguments are first: that interventions to extend individual choice are likely to have only limited traction when organizations are struggling to operate with limited resources and second: households on low incomes often struggle to take up the choices that are made available through these service reforms. In the conclusion, it is suggested that the current Australian housing agenda to extend competition and choice is best situated within the wider setting of neoliberal policymaking. Though both concepts might appeal to those advocating consumer rights, their deployment serves to conceal a broader political agenda â€“ to restructure welfare provision in ways that advantage the commercial sector."
"Teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs, attitudes and concerns about implementing inclusive education in Ghana Inclusive Education; Special Educational Needs; Psychological Practice This study explored teacher self-efficacy, attitudes and concerns about implementing inclusive education in Ghana, using a four-part survey questionnaire comprising Teachersâ€™ Background Information, Self-Efficacy About Inclusive Education, Attitudes Toward Inclusive Education and Concerns About Inclusive Education. Data obtained from 134 primary school teachers in two regions were analysed using Descriptive statistics, t-Tests, ANOVA and Correlation procedures. The results indicate that Ghanaian teachers in the study have concerns about inclusive education, less positive attitudes and also have moderate levels of self-efficacy about implementing inclusive education. These findings have implications for sustaining inclusive education and are discussed in relation to contextual variables and student demands."
"Using the capability approach to evaluate energy vulnerability policies and initiatives in Victoria, Australia Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Energy vulnerability is a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-specific phenomenon that poses a challenge for equity in energy transition policies. The Capability Approach (CA) is a normative framework focused on peopleâ€™s opportunities and freedoms, used to address dimensions of social justice. Whereas the CA has been used to assess and measure conditions of poverty, exclusion and inequality, its application to evaluate policies is rare. Building on work that establishes being able to heat the home adequately as a secondary capability towards being able to lead a healthy life, this narrative review maps the conditions and processes that shape this secondary capability in Victoria, Australia. It also evaluates local policies and initiatives aimed at addressing energy vulnerability. The map identifies structural, geographical and cultural phenomena and feed-back loops and exposes a hierarchy of capabilities for vulnerable households that need to be satisfied. The policy review finds that current efforts focus on mitigating inequalities in resources with little evidence for outcomes in security or transformative agency. Future initiatives may give more attention to the satisfaction of the tertiary capability of being able to live in an energy efficient dwelling, customise solutions to the multitude and range of conditions and acknowledge the need of warmth throughout the home."

"Implementation of recycling cigarette butts in lightweight bricks and a proposal for ending the littering of cigarette butts in our cities Tobacco; Smoking; Leachates Our cities, parks, beaches, and oceans have been contaminated for many years with millions of tonnes of unsightly and toxic cigarette butts (CBs). This study presents and discusses some of the results of an ongoing study on recycling in fired-clay bricks. Energy savings: the energy value of CBs with remnant tobacco was found to be 16.5 MJ/kg. If just 2.5% of all bricks produced annually worldwide included 1% CB content, all of the CBs currently produced could be recycled in bricks, and it is estimated that global firing energy consumption could be reduced by approximately 20 billion MJ (megajoules). This approximately equates to the power used by one million homes in Victoria, Australia, every year. Bacteriological study: CBs were investigated for the presence of ten common bacteria in two pilot studies. Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected in fresh used CB samples, and Listeria spp. were detected in old used CB samples. All of the CB samples except the dried sample had significant counts of Bacillus spp. Some species of the detected bacteria in this study are pathogenic. Further confirmation and comprehensive microbiological study are needed in this area. The contact of naphthalene balls with CBs had a significant disinfecting effect on Bacillus spp. The implementation procedure for recycling CBs in bricks, odour from Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions in CBs, sterilization methods, CB collection systems, and safety instructions were investigated, and they are discussed. Proposal: when considering the combined risks from many highly toxic chemicals and possible pathogens in cigarette butts, it is proposed that littering of this waste anywhere in cities and the environment be strictly prohibited and that offenders be heavily fined."

"Investigating the learning process in job search: A longitudinal study Information Behaviour; Information Retrieval; Web Search We investigated the learning process in search by conducting a log-based study involving registered job seekers of a commercial job search engine. The analysis shows that job search is a complex task: seekers usually submit multiple queries over sessions that can last days or even weeks. We find that querying, clicking, and job application rates change over time: job seekers tend to use more filters and a less diverse set of query terms. In terms of click and application behavior, we observed a significant decrease in click rate and query term diversity, as well as an increase in application rates. These trends are found to largely match information seeking models of learning in a complex search task. However, common behaviors are observed in the logs that suggest the existing models may not be sufficient to describe all of the users' learning and seeking processes."
"Reconnecting with Food through Dining Play Household Energy; Energy; Smart Meters While the food production and processing are known to cause major environmental pollution, we as consumers have little awareness of the underlying processes that bring food from farm to plate. This lack of awareness influences our food related decisions and we end up following non-sustainable food practices. To create awareness on food related issues, we present two playful dining experiences: (1) Caesar on a Skewer that presents the hidden data about water consumption levels for different foods through a Caesar salad, and (2) Chopstick Parfait that visualizes the hidden data related to the food distribution channels through the Parfait dessert. We simulated the dining environment to evaluate these dining experiences. We present findings related to both dining play interactions and edible visualizations. To guide future technological development around food related issues, we discuss the implications of our work around three themes: food arrangement, playful discomforts and delayed feedback. Through this work, we aim to advocate and inspire the use of food for designing multi-sensorial serious play."

"Growth of rGO nanostructures via facile wick and oil flame synthesis for environmental remediation Water; Hydrophobicity; Aerogels Oil spills into ocean or coastal waters can result in significant damage to the environment via pollution of aquatic ecosystems. Absorbents based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) foams have the capacity to remove minor or major oil spills. However, conventional chemical synthesis of rGO often uses petrochemical precursors, potentially harmful chemicals, and requires special processing conditions that are expensive to maintain. In this work, an alternative cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach suitable for large-scale production of high-quality rGO directly from used cooking sunflower oil is discussed. Thus, produced flaky graphene structures are effective in absorbing used commercial sunflower oil and engine oil, via monolayer physisorption in the case of used sunflower and engine oils facilitated by van der Waals forces, Ï€â€“Ï€ stacking and hydrophobic interactions, Ï€-cation (H+) stacking and radical scavenging activities. From adsorption kinetic models, first-order kinetics provides a better fit for used sunflower oil adsorption (R2 = 0.9919) and second-order kinetics provides a better fit for engine oil adsorption (R2 = 0.9823). From intra-particle diffusion model, R2 for USO is 0.9788 and EO is 0.9851, which indicates that both used sunflower and engine oils adsorption processes follow an intra-particle diffusion mechanism. This study confirms that waste-derived rGO could be used for environmental remediation."

"The influence of overseas study and work experience on corporate environmental disclosures: evidence from Vietnam Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: Drawing from Upper-Echelons Theory (UET), this paper aims to examine whether an increasing number of board members studying and working overseas, especially in Anglo countries, provides some impetus for increased corporate environmental disclosures (CED) in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: This study used quantitative data collection and analysis. The data collection involved a content analysis of annual, sustainability and integrated reports to capture the quality and quantity of CED. The authors subsequently developed ordered probit models to quantitatively test the hypotheses. Findings: The authors find that board members studying in Anglo countries positively impact firmsâ€™ levels of CED in emerging economies. However, overseas work experience is found to be an insignificant explanatory variable. Further, the findings suggest that, in Vietnam, Chairs appear to be more influential than chief executive officers in affecting CED levels. Practical implications: Despite the positive influence of overseas study, the authors find overall levels of CED in Vietnam remain relatively low. This suggests the necessity of dialogue about potential reform in CED policies, which could involve the introduction of mandatory reporting requirements. In addition, to enhance sustainability disclosures, shareholders should appoint board members who possess international qualifications. Originality/value: This study adds to the literature exploring the impacts of Anglo cultural traits of board members on CED levels, within an economy transitioning from a communist ideology to a market-oriented system context. The connection between international study and cultural norms, beliefs and traditions in these countries and their positive influence on directorsâ€™ values and attitudes towards CED have not yet been studied. The study also extends UET by examining the potential positive influence of different national contexts on board membersâ€™ education levels."

"Localisation of the Sustainable Development Goals in an emerging nation Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), agreed to by all member countries of the United Nations, require urgent action on the world's most pressing problems. Success requires bottom-up participation of local stakeholders. This case study of Timor-Lesteâ€”a fledgling, fossil fuel-supported economyâ€”maps the awareness and commitment of grassroots stakeholders to the SDGs and the roadblocks to localisation. Guiding this paper is Habermasâ€™ view of societal evolution and communicative action, which aids analysing the socio-political and structural dynamics affecting SDGs localisation in a developing nation. This study reveals stakeholder inability to articulate a clear vision for the SDGs, lack of human capital and funds, a weak public-administrative system, strong socio-political nuances, and poor governance infrastructure to support multi-stakeholder relationships. This paper provides insights for developing a more nuanced and robust public intervention to support local stakeholders that will enable knowledge, cultural and communication transformations required for successful SDGs localisation."

"Responsible use of technology to combat cyberbullying among young people Cyberbullying; Crime Victims; Workplace Bullying Cyberbullying has become a major challenge for authorities, parents, guardians and schools in particular, especially in the era of the digital world. This paper reviews available empirical research to examine the issues such as the responsible use of technology amongst young people, parents and schools responsibility to protect against Cyberbullying. The analysis revealed that the responsible use of technology provides better practices to encourage comparisons because of these new digital technologies. Parents and educators are the key to Cyber ethics, therefore teaching the responsible use of technology whilst focusing on Cyber ethics at the start of young people's exposure to technology use may be an excellent strategy to reduce the growth and impact of Cyberbullying. The paper will also review good practices for young people, school communities and parents to prevent and manage Cyberbullying and unethical behaviours online. These claims are examined using current literature to ensure a better understanding of responsible use of technology and understanding of Cyberbullying in order to support young people to combat this immerging societal challenge."

"Inclusion and work: Addressing the global challenges for youth employment Young; Youth Labour Market; School-To-Work Transition Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to outline the key global challenges relating to youth employment and consider some ways that they may be addressed to allow their inclusion in the contemporary workplace. Also, the paper provides a brief introduction and rationale for the other five articles comprising this special issue volume. Design/methodology/approach - The approach concerns a review of the relevant literature and reports on the topic. Findings - The challenges outlined in this paper and the others in this special issue volume emphasise the need for much more work to be done to address the current global challenges relating to youth unemployment. It points to: the difficulties many young workers face in taking the first step towards gaining employment; the need for stakeholder collaboration towards future policy investment as well as strategy implementation and integration. Originality/value - To date, much of the research that has been conducted on the challenges of youth employment and inclusion appears to have focussed on Europe and the USA. This special issue volume includes countries that have been less researched to date: Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mauritius, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, thus adding to current understanding of the topic in those contexts."

"Development of intestinal bioavailability prediction (IBP) and phytochemical relative antioxidant potential prediction (PRAPP) models for optimizing functional food value of Cannabis sativa (hemp) Strength Training; Athletes; Antioxidant Oxidative stress and inflammation (OSI) occurs naturally during many biological processes including digestion, metabolism, and exercise. While small, transient amounts of OSI are considered normal, unregulated, or chronic OSI can damage the vascular-circulatory system, which can result in chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), atherosclerosis, and cancer. Antioxidant phytochemicals have the capacity to mitigate OSI through radical scavenging activity or the induction of endogenous mechanisms, but to achieve optimal reductions in OSI, the timing of antioxidant effects must occur during the onset of OSIâ€“a concept known as â€˜bio-matching.â€™ Additionally, the bioavailability and antioxidant capacity of active phytochemicals should be accounted for during pharmacokinetic assessments to guide bio-matching. Herein two quantitative structureâ€“activity relationship (QSAR) predictive models are presented: the intestinal absorption prediction (IBP) model for predicting compound bioavailability (r2 = 0.93), and the phytochemical relative antioxidant potential prediction (PRAPP) model for predicting antioxidant capacity (r2 = 0.89). Application of these models to a characterized hemp meal phytochemical profile, along with established models for predicting Tmax and TÂ½, generated a composite antioxidant fingerprint, which predicted a peak in antioxidant activity 36 min after ingestion in liquid form. Accordingly, hemp meal-based protein powders (a common exercise supplement) should be consumed 26 min prior to completion of exercise to achieve bio-matching with the onset of exercise-induced OSI 10 min after exercise. The IBP and PRAPP models presented herein could be useful tools in understanding phytochemical complex antioxidant pharmacodynamics and in optimizing the consumption of hemp meal and other functional foods to achieve bio-matching of composite antioxidant activity with OSI profiles.

"Innovative Biosolid reuse technologies for post mining restoration Soil nitrogen content (SNC) is an important indicator which strongly correlates with the crop yield and greenhouse gas emissions. The effective monitoring of SNC can also minimise over-fertilization which is a ubiquitous problem in Australia and China. So far the measurements are mainly based on optical, radiometric and electrochemical platforms. However, these technologies are yet capable of applied widely in farmland due to their relatively high cost and non-continuous measurement nature. 
The correlation between nitrogen fertilizers and nitrous oxide gas emission provides a strong base to use low-cost gas sensor networks for monitoring SNC in a real-time and online manner. This project will involve the collaboration between RMIT University (Australia) and Intelirri Technology Co., Ltd., (China) to apply the patented nitrous oxide physisorption gas sensor technology (RMIT) into the smart wireless agriculture platform (Intelirri Technology) to develop the world?s first real-time and online SNC monitoring system. This project will align with the ?Food and agribusiness? priority area and expect to be last for two years. Researchers from RMIT will travel to Beijing to meet with delegates from Intelirri Technology for discussing the feasibility study and business plan. Intelirri Technology will not only provide their patented technologies but also the company-owned farms to assist the system development and evaluation.

"Blockchain and the evolution of institutional technologies: Implications for innovation policy Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things For the past century economists have proposed a suite of theories relating to industrial dynamics, technological change and innovation. There has been an implication in these models that the institutional environment is stable. However, a new class of institutional technologiesâ€”most notably blockchain technologyâ€”lower the cost of institutional entrepreneurship along these margins, propelling a process of institutional evolution. This presents a new type of innovation process, applicable to the formation and development of institutions for economic governance and coordination. This paper develops a replicator dynamic model of institutional innovation and proposes some implications of this innovation for innovation policy. Given the influence of public policies on transaction costs and associated institutional choices, it is indicated that policy settings conductive to the adoption and use of blockchain technology would elicit entrepreneurial experiments in institutional forms harnessing new coordinative possibilities in economic exchange. Conceptualisation of blockchain-related public policy an innovation policy in its own right has significant implications for the operation and understanding of open innovation systems in a globalised context."

"Suitability Assessment of Marble, Glass Powders and Poly-Propylene Fibers for Improvement of Siwalik Clay Compressive Strength; Atterberg Limit; Polypropylene Fiber Raising of the Mangla Dam in Pakistan submerged about 15,780 acres of land, resulting in the relocation of 8020 inhabitants to a newly developed town named New City. The new site, consisting of 1300 acres, is in the sub-tropical zone and comprises badland topography. The parent soils (Siwalik clay) pose infrastructure serviceability issues, causing immense loss to property. The study aims to improve the properties of Siwalik clay (base soil) using industrial wastes like marble and glass powders (5 to 20%) and polypropylene fibers (0.25 to 1.25%) as modifiers. Laboratory tests including grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, standard Proctor compaction, unconfined compression, indirect tensile strength, swell potential, and California bearing ratio were conducted on the control and modified clay samples. The results showed that unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and swelling strains (SS) were increased by 43% and 8% at 1.57 kPa pressure with 15% replacement of marble powder. However, the addition of the 20% glass powder and 0.5% polypropylene fibers not only improved UCS by 110% and 39%, but also reduced SS by 27% and 86%, respectively. The capital construction cost of 1 km long road with modified subgrade using 15% glass powder was reduced by 16% whereas it increased for marble powder and polypropylene fibers by 22% and 17%, respectively. All modifiers had very low hazard to adjoining aqueous environment. Conclusively, glass powder and polypropylene fibers can be used as environmentally-friendly soil improvement modifiers, leading towards sustainable solutions of the serviceability problems."
"Synergetic influence of F-MWCNTS on polyvinylpyrrolidone sodium alginate composite membrane for reverse osmosis Polyethersulfone; Membrane; Ultrafiltration In this study, novel composite membrane of functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (F-MWCNTs) polyvinyl pyrrolidine (PVP) and sodium alginate (Na-Alg) with unique characteristics were synthesized for the application of reverse osmosis (RO) desalination. The MWCNTs in different amounts were systematically and uniformly dispersed in PVP/Na-Alg polymer matrix during the synthesis of membranes by dissolution casting method. The effect of F-MWCNTs content in the performance of the composite membrane was investigated for RO desalination process compared to PVP/Na-Alg blended membrane. The spectral studies were carried out by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (chemical bonding) and scanning electron microscopy (surface morphology). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of membranes also recommended that composite membrane with the highest content of F-MWCNT has more excellent thermal stability compared to PVP/Na-Alg blended membrane and other modified membrane samples. The most striking experimental results show that the incorporation of F-MWCNTs improved the general RO performance of the composite membranes. The modified composite membrane surface became rough as compared to the PVP/Na-Alg blend membrane surface. The PVP/Na-Alg blended membrane shows a maximum permeation flux of 5.5 L/m2h and high-water content. This experimental analysis also presented that tethered F-MWCNTs/PVP/Na-Alg polymer matrix membrane, with stronger F-MWCNTs/polymer matrix interactions, enhanced the composite membrane's salt rejection performance by 85.4% for the highest content of F-MWCNTs. Therefore, it can be concluded that all the membrane samples presented excellent capacity to resist the growth of gram-negative E. coli bacteria."
"Root Cause Analysis of Traffic Anomalies Using Uneven Diffusion Model Taxis; Passengers; Lack Detection and analysis of traffic anomalies are important for the development of intelligent transportation systems. In particular, the root causes of traffic anomalies in road networks as well as their propagation and influence to the surrounding areas are highly meaningful. The root cause analysis of traffic anomalies aims to identify those road segments, where the traffic anomalies are detected by the traffic statuses significantly deviating from the usual condition and are originated due to incidents occurring in those roads such as traffic accidents or social events. The existing methods for traffic anomaly root cause analysis detect all traffic anomalies first and then apply, implicitly or explicitly, specified causal propagation rules to infer the root cause. However, these methods require reliable detection techniques to accurately identify all traffic anomalies and extensive domain knowledge of city traffic to specify plausible causal propagation rules in road networks. In contrast, this paper proposes an innovative and integrated root cause analysis method. The proposed method is featured by 1) defining a visible outlier index as the probabilistic indicator of traffic anomalies/disturbances and 2) automatically learning spatiotemporal causal relationship from historical data to build an uneven diffusion model for root cause analysis. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method have been demonstrated by experiments conducted on a trajectory dataset with 2.5 billion location records of 27 266 taxies in Shenzhen city."

"Impact of rheological properties of substrate on anaerobic digestion and digestate dewaterability: New insights through rheological and physico-chemical interaction Activated Sludge; Biofilm Matrix; Sewage Mesophilic batch anaerobic digesters fed by different substrates were set up to identify the role of substrate rheology in anaerobic digestion performance while operating below the toxic level. Five substrates of different rheological behaviour but at the same amount of organic matters were prepared by addition of different amount of an inert material (0, 0.03, 0.07, 0.11, and 0.20 g) per g of waste activated sludge (WAS). To gain a comprehensive insight, the interactive relationship between substrate rheology, physico-chemical properties and biogas production as well as digestate dewaterability was investigated. The results proved that better access of microorganisms to organic matters improved the digester performance and led to 19.29% and 12.5% increase in biogas yield and VS removal efficiency, respectively. Moreover, the statistical analysis showed that consistency index and loss modulus of sludge could be employed as promising indications for biogas yield while yield stress could predict dewaterability of digestate as far as the other physico-chemical properties remained unchanged. During digestion measurement of consistency index and loss modulus of digestate could be performed as a reliable tool to monitor biogas production."
"Patriarchal marketing and the symbolic annihilation of women Football; Masculinity; Sports In this commentary, I introduce the concept of patriarchal marketing in examining the persistence of gender inequality in marketing and consumer culture. I define patriarchal marketing as marketing that operates in accordance with a male-dominated power structure, in turn dominating, oppressing and exploiting women. I name this as a problem that produces the symbolic annihilation of women. In turn, this has three effects: trivialisation of the complexities of womenâ€™s lives, omission of those outside of the hegemonic feminine ideal and condemnation of womenâ€™s corporeality. I propose that the adoption of a feminist standpoint can challenge the oppressive power structures of patriarchal marketing that symbolically annihilate women."

"Labour and regional transition: sex-segregation, the absence of gender and the valorisation of masculinised employment in Gippsland, Australia Gender Mainstreaming; Feminism; European Union This paper explores the place of gender in relation to labour and transition in regional development. A â€˜gendered lensâ€™ is applied to planning documents relating to the region of Gippsland, Australia. While previous research highlights the importance of accounting for gender in regional development, gendered analyses outside Europe are scarce. We argue that an apparent gender neutrality in planning documents in effect privileges masculinised elements of the economy. It means that current approaches to regional development, at best, reproduce the gendered status quo and, at worst, further re-entrench gender inequality in the region, with consequences for regional labour policy. Our findings have flow on effects for gender relations, and specifically for women, and economic policy in regions undergoing transition in Gippsland. We conclude that any regional policy that does not account for gendered realities and the lived experiences of women, ultimately fails the region."

"Minimizing Non-selective Nanowrinkles of Reduced Graphene Oxide Laminar Membranes for Enhanced NaCl Rejection Graphene Oxide; Nanofiltration Membranes; Graphite Reduced graphene oxide membranes (rGOMs) have been intensively studied for desalination and molecular sieving applications, benefiting from their selective and stable two-dimensional (2D) nanochannels. However, their performance is usually over-rated because of the limited understanding of nanowrinkles. In this study, we tuned 2D nanochannels and nanowrinkles in rGOMs to improve their performance and revealed the underlying role of nanowrinkles for water and salt separation. A good trade-off between water permeance (1.05 LMH/bar) and NaCl rejection (83%) was obtained in rGOMs thermally treated in air (Air-rGO), compared with their counterparts synthesized via thermal treatment in vacuum (Va-rGO) and HI vapor reduction (HI-rGO). Instead of the narrow and impermeable 2D nanochannels in Va-rGO and HI-rGO, 5-10 nm-sized nanowrinkles were evident to transport water and salts without selectivity, leading to the low water permeance and NaCl rejection. For Air-rGO membranes, however, the smaller and fewer nanowrinkles retarded the NaCl transfer and the slightly narrowed 2D nanochannels maintained the fast water flow, contributing to the high NaCl rejection and water permeance, respectively. This study provides new insights into the mass transport mechanism in nanowrinkles of rGOMs and advances the design of 2D membranes for desalination, molecular/ionic sieving, and other environmental applications."

"“It just fits my needs better”: Autistic students and parents’ experiences of learning from home during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic Autism; Children with Developmental Disabilities; Caregivers Background and aims: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to people's lives, especially for families, whose children have been taken out of schools during lockdown restrictions and required to learn from home. Little is known, however, about the perceived impact of the lockdown restrictions on the educational experiences of autistic children and young people â€“ a group whose conventional schooling experiences are already often challenging. In this study, we sought to (1) understand these experiences from the perspectives of autistic young people and their parents, and (2) identify the underlying sources of positive experiences at this challenging time, in order to inform the ways in which autistic children might flourish at school in more normal times. Methods: Ninety-one Australian participants, including 16 autistic young people aged 12â€“18 years, 32 autistic parents and 43 non-autistic parents of autistic young people aged 3â€“18 years, took part in semi-structured interviews about their experiences of life during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The interviews were subjected to reflexive, thematic analysis to identify themes and subthemes for each research question. Results: Overall, our participants initially found the transition to learning from home extremely challenging, with parents reporting that the support received from schools was far from adequate. After that initial period of transition, however, many autistic children reported flourishing at home both educationally and personally. For these children and families, we identified three key ingredients essential to this flourishing, including: (i) the importance of connected, trusting relationships (â€˜peopleâ€™); (ii) the sensory and social safety of home (â€˜placeâ€™); and (iii) the flexibility to pace and structure learning to suit the individual child (â€˜timeâ€™). Conclusions: While the initial COVID-19 lockdown presented many challenges to children learning at home, there were aspects of this otherwise-unsettling situation that enabled children to thrive and from which we can learn for the future. Implications: These findings have important implications for understanding how and when autistic children might thrive in institutional educational settings once the pandemic subsides, focusing on the relationships between teachers and students, the nature of the physical learning environment and the need for greater flexibility in planning the school day."

"Variation in leaf area density drives the rainfall storage capacity of individual urban tree species Stemflow; Interception; Throughfall A rapid rise of urban population is making cities denser. Consequently, the proportion of impervious surface cover has enlarged, increasing the amount and speed of run-off reaching urban catchment areas, which may cause flash flooding. Trees play a key role to reduce run-off in the city, as they intercept rainfall and store part of it on their leaves and branches, reducing the amount and speed of water running onto impervious surfaces. Storage capacity will depend on the rainfall event, the climate conditions and tree characteristics and canopy density. These canopy characteristics vary greatly among different species and their phenology. Furthermore, these canopy characteristics can vary greatly among individual trees of the same age, size, and species. This study tested how canopy density and leaf characteristics of three different tree species affect storage capacity under simulated rainfall conditions. Three species were selected (Ulmus procera, Platanus Ã— acerifolia, and Corymbia maculata), each being of the same height and similar canopy dimensions. Storage capacity was measured using a mass balance approach during a 15-min indoor, simulated rainfall event (2.5 mm/hr). Canopy metrics were estimated using a terrestrial laser scanner. Canopy surface area was measured through destructive harvest and leaf/twig/branch scanning. To investigate variations in the canopy leaf density, leaves were systematically removed to create four treatments: full, half, quarter, and woody. Canopy storage capacity was well correlated to plant surface area (m2), plant area index (m2/m2), and plant area density (m2/m3). All analyses indicated U. procera as the most efficient species for storing rainfall water within a canopy of equal volume or area index. Results reveal the complexity of evaluating interception of rainfall by tree canopies. This study contributes to the discipline and practice by distinguishing how variation in the leaf density is important to consider when selecting urban tree species to be planted."

"Aryl urea substituted fatty acids: A new class of protonophoric mitochondrial uncoupler that utilises a synthetic anion transporter Anions; Lipid Bilayer; Prodigiosin Respiring mitochondria establish a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) that is used to generate ATP. Protein-independent mitochondrial uncouplers collapse the proton gradient and disrupt ATP production by shuttling protons back across the MIM in a protonophoric cycle. Continued cycling relies on the formation of MIM-permeable anionic species that can return to the intermembrane space after deprotonation in the mitochondrial matrix. Previously described protonophores contain acidic groups that are part of delocalised p-systems that provide large surfaces for charge delocalisation and facilitate anion permeation across the MIM. Here we present a new class of protonophoric uncoupler based on aryl-urea substituted fatty acids in which an acidic group and a p-system are separated by a long alkyl chain. The aryl-urea group in these molecules acts as a synthetic anion receptor that forms intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the fatty acid carboxylate after deprotonation. Dispersal of the negative charge across the aryl-urea system produces lipophilic dimeric complexes that can permeate the MIM and facilitate repeated cycling. Substitution of the aryl-urea group with lipophilic electron withdrawing groups is critical to complex lipophilicity and uncoupling activity. The aryl-urea substituted fatty acids represent the first biological example of mitochondrial uncoupling mediated by the interaction of a fatty acid and an anion receptor moiety, via self-assembly."
"Opportunity, ideal or distraction? Exploring stakeholder perceptions of tackling energy poverty and vulnerability among older Australians Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Energy vulnerability intersects with housing, social and health issues, yet current siloed approaches and piece-meal energy assistance initiatives are often leaving â€˜hard to reachâ€™ older householders behind. Cross-disciplinary strategies promise better identification of vulnerable people, sustained relief and scalable solutions, yet such innovative approaches are still rare. Using the Australian in-home aged care services as a case study, this research explored how stakeholders perceived the idea of integrating energy assistance with health services for people aged 65 and over. Understanding the views of potential advocates and adopters may guide the development, design and implementation of such an innovation. This study engaged front-line workers, executives and policy makers across organisations aiming at carbon emission reduction, equity and health. Climate action stakeholders and in-home aged care services staff recognised synergies across their programmes and welcomed the idea as an opportunity to address hidden energy poverty. Equity stakeholders perceived it as an ideal and doubted that its aspirations were likely to be fully realised given the priorities of vulnerable, older people. An aged care services industry representative, however, saw this proposition as a distraction from dealing with the broader challenges of an ageing population. These insights highlight the need to co-design such an initiative. The engagement of health policy makers is critical but challenging. Further research is needed to align energy assistance with the needs and circumstances of in-home aged care services clients and to develop solutions for older renters."
"Using the capability approach to evaluate energy vulnerability policies and initiatives in Victoria, Australia Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Energy vulnerability is a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-specific phenomenon that poses a challenge for equity in energy transition policies. The Capability Approach (CA) is a normative framework focused on peopleâ€™s opportunities and freedoms, used to address dimensions of social justice. Whereas the CA has been used to assess and measure conditions of poverty, exclusion and inequality, its application to evaluate policies is rare. Building on work that establishes being able to heat the home adequately as a secondary capability towards being able to lead a healthy life, this narrative review maps the conditions and processes that shape this secondary capability in Victoria, Australia. It also evaluates local policies and initiatives aimed at addressing energy vulnerability. The map identifies structural, geographical and cultural phenomena and feed-back loops and exposes a hierarchy of capabilities for vulnerable households that need to be satisfied. The policy review finds that current efforts focus on mitigating inequalities in resources with little evidence for outcomes in security or transformative agency. Future initiatives may give more attention to the satisfaction of the tertiary capability of being able to live in an energy efficient dwelling, customise solutions to the multitude and range of conditions and acknowledge the need of warmth throughout the home."

"Infrastructure-independent indoor localization and navigation Dead Reckoning; Navigation; Inertial Navigation In the absence of any global positioning infrastructure for indoor environments, research on supporting human indoor localization and navigation trails decades behind research on outdoor localization and navigation. The major barrier to broader progress has been the dependency of indoor positioning on environment-specific infrastructure and resulting tailored technical solutions. Combined with the fragmentation and compartmentalization of indoor environments, this poses significant challenges to widespread adoption of indoor location-based services. This article puts aside all approaches of infrastructure-based support for human indoor localization and navigation and instead reviews technical concepts that are independent of sensors embedded in the environment. The reviewed concepts rely on a mobile computing platform with sensing capability and a human interaction interface (â€œsmartphoneâ€). This platform may or may not carry a stored map of the environment, but does not require in situ internet access. In this regard, the presented approaches are more challenging than any localization and navigation solutions specific to a particular, infrastructure-equipped indoor space, since they are not adapted to local context, and they may lack some of the accuracy achievable with those tailored solutions. However, only these approaches have the potential to be universally applicable."

"Least-square variance-covariance component estimation method based on the equivalent conditional adjustment model Least-Squares Analysis; Block Structure; Best Linear Unbiased Estimator A VCE method termed the least-square variance-covariance component estimation method based on the equivalent conditional misclosure (LSV-ECM) is developed. Three steps are involved. First, the equivalent conditional misclosure is extracted using the projection matrix in the equivalent conditional adjustment model, of which the quadratic equations are established for variance-covariance component estimation. The quadratic equations in the form of matrix are then transformed to the linearized Gauss-Markov form using the half-vectorization operator. A simplified and generalized LSV-ECM method is derived using the least-square principle with an unbiased and optimal estimation.Furthermore, the equivalence between the LSV-ECM and the existing VCE methods is proven mathematically, and computational complexities of the LSV-ECM and the existing VCE methods are quantitatively analyzed and investigated in the indirect adjustment model. It is shown that the new method gives the highest computational efficiency. Finally, the performance and superiority of the new method is evaluated through an adjustment of a triangulateration network and an analysis of a coordinate time series of GNSS stations."

"ICT-Mediated and Digital Technologies for Peace and Sustainability in Cities The focus of the research programme is on enabling digital technologies for achieving the SDGs and governance 
of sustainability transition. This will be focused on the NERPS’ central theme of peace and sustainability, as well 
as transdisciplinary methods to the enhancement of institutional structures. This project plan will be further 
developed with the team to ensure if fits the needs and perspectives of the research pathways at Hiroshima 
University.

The aim of the study is to explore and evaluate ICT-based methods and medium (Including ICT platforms, digital 
technologies and mechanisms) focused on health sector and health initiatives at the city and community levels. 
For the health sector, we look into ICT-mediated methods that address resilience of cities and communities, by 
addressing two of the positive peace dimensions, namely “a well-functioning government” and “equitable 
distribution of resources”. For the health initiatives, we look into specific smart healthcare and smart health 
services, by addressing two other positive peace dimensions, namely “free flow of information” and “good 
relations with neighbours”. We then evaluate how ICT-mediated approaches could help to meet the four 
dimensions of sustainability, defined as the core principles of sustainable development. These dimensions 
include social, economic, environmental, and institutional. "
"POTENTIAL FOR DESCENDING METEORIC WATER RECHARGE IN HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEMS AS A PATHWAY FOR CARBON DIOXIDE SEQUESTRATION Olivine; Carbonation; Carbon Dioxide The storage of carbon dioxide in secure underground sites has been identified as an important contributor to preventing climate change impacts of excessive CO2 in the atmosphere. Significant quantities of carbon dioxide must be collected and stored for this technology to make the required contribution to climate change abatement. The carbon dioxide can be stored as a gas, supercritical fluid or a solid by mineralization. Most attention has been on reservoirs which are depleted in oil or gas or in saline aquifers more generally. Trapping gas or supercritical fluid requires a setting similar to the natural trapping of gases in sub-surface sedimentary rock reservoirs. The most advanced high-volume projects focus on the trapping of supercritical fluids. Pumping carbon dioxide into basalt host rocks to promote carbonate mineralization is also being undertaken. In this paper another environment in which CO2 is naturally introduced into geological materials and stored below ground is reviewed. The environment is natural hydrothermal systems which are commonly found around magmatically active locations. In these areas it is common for the cool near-surface (meteoric) water to descend as a replacement (recharge) of the warm or hot magmatic water in the hydrothermal-magmatic system. The descending CO2 can react with existing rocks and minerals to form carbonates of calcium and other cations. It is proposed that introduction of CO2 into naturally descending meteoric water recharge in hydrothermal systems may be a mechanism for CO2 sequestration by mineral trapping. Further investigation of this process and its potential is proposed."

"Carbon Fibers Embedded With Iron Selenide (Fe3Se4) as Anode for High-Performance Sodium and Potassium Ion Batteries Sodium-ion Batteries; Electrode; Ion Storage The development of sodium and potassium ion batteries (SIBs/KIBs) has seen tremendous growth in recent years due to their promising properties as a potential replacement for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Here, we report ultrafine iron selenide (Fe3Se4) nanoparticles embedded into one-dimensional (1D) carbon fibers (Fe3Se4@CFs) as a potential candidate for SIBs/KIBs. The Fe-based metal-organic framework particles (MOFP) are used as a Fe source to obtain highly dispersed Fe3Se4 nanoparticles in the product. The Fe3Se4@CF consisted of ultrafine particles of Fe3Se4 with an average particle size of ~10 nm loaded into CFs with an average diameter of 300 nm. The product exhibited excellent specific activity of ~439 and ~435 mAh/g at the current density of 50 mA/g for SIBs and KIBs, respectively. In addition, the as-prepared anodes (Fe3Se4@CFs) exhibited excellent capacity retention up to several hundred cycles (700 cycles for SIBs and 300 cycles for KIBs). The high activity and excellent stability of the developed electrodes make Fe3Se4@CFs a promising electrode for next-generation batteries."
"Engineering performance of concrete incorporated with recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE)—A systematic review Rubber Waste; Mechanical Properties; Tires Incorporating recycled plastic waste in concrete manufacturing is one of the most ecologically and economically sustainable solutions for the rapid trends of annual plastic disposal and natural resource depletion worldwide. This paper comprehensively reviews the literature on engineering performance of recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) incorporated in concrete in the forms of aggregates or fiber or cementitious material. Optimum 28-daysâ€™ compressive and flexural strength of HDPE fine aggregate concrete is observed at HDPE-10 and splitting tensile strength at HDPE-5 whereas for HDPE coarse aggregate concrete, within the range of 10% to 15% of HDPE incorporation and at HDPE-15, respectively. Similarly, 28-daysâ€™ flexural and splitting tensile strength of HDPE fiber reinforced concrete is increased to an optimum of 4.9 MPa at HDPE-3 and 4.4 MPa at HDPE-3.5, respectively, and higher than the standard/plain concrete matrix (HDPE-0) in all HDPE inclusion levels. Hydrophobicity, smooth surface texture and non-reactivity of HDPE has resulted in weaker bonds between concrete matrix and HDPE and thereby reducing both mechanical and durability performances of HDPE concrete with the increase of HDPE. Overall, this is the first ever review to present and analyze the current state of the mechanical and durability performance of recycled HDPE as a sustainable construction material, hence, advancing the research into better performance and successful applications of HDPE concrete."

"Coal mine-affected water releases, turbidity and metal concentrations in the Fitzroy River Basin, Queensland, Australia Schwertmannite; Acid Mine Drainage; Iron Historical water quality datasets from the Fitzroy Basin, a large river system that receives mine-affected water from more than 40 mines, and drains into the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon, were analysed. There is great public and environmental interest in these waters that are used for agriculture, recreation and raw drinking water supplies. Aside from one AMD-impacted area, waters were generally alkaline. Turbidity data regularly exceeded the regional water quality objective (< 50 NTU), indicating the presence of particulates that may accumulate or transport metal contaminants within the waters. Analyses of data for 14 metals showed dissolved Cu and Al, followed by Zn, were the parameters that were most often greater than Australian toxicant guideline values. Analysis of coal mine-affected water samples and the receiving creek data, showed that median turbidity was greater downstream than upstream of the mine water release points, suggesting release-water may contain particulate-bound metals. Median dissolved Al and Cu concentrations were lower downstream than upstream and were above guidelines. Preliminary modelling using WHAM7 suggested downstream dissolved Cu (2â€“5 Âµg/L) was bound to fulvic acid and was likely not bioavailable. Dissolved Al (170â€“550 Âµg/L) may have existed as Al(OH)4 âˆ’. Overall, suspended particulate matter appeared to be a water quality parameter of interest in this mine-affected river basin. Further targeted sampling, direct measurement of particulate-bound metals and multivariate statistical analysis are needed to help better understand metal partitioning in these turbid, alkaline waters."
"Housing Industry Transitions: An Urban Living Lab in Melbourne, Australia Energy Transition; Innovation System; Sustainability Urban housing experiments test real-world applications of sustainable, liveable, affordable and innovative developments. However, there is limited evidence of how they influence the wider building regime through the facilitation of new shared experiences, networks and relations. This paper explores the influence of a government-led demonstration project in Melbourne, Australia. Interviews with 14 key industry stakeholders reveal that, while some innovations had limited impact on practice, others resulted in take-up. The case adds to previous studies on the contested nature of sustainable building experiments and develops empirical insights on how such developments shape and are shaped by industry low carbon transitions."

"Co-pyrolysis of biosolids with alum sludge: Effect of temperature and mixing ratio on product properties Sewage; Pyrolysis; Pulp and Paper Sludge Sustainable management of biosolids and alum sludge are becoming increasingly important due to the rapid growth in their production with increasing urbanization globally. Pyrolysis has been identified as a promising method for biosolids management. However, land application of biochar derived from pyrolysis of biosolids may be limited despite their significant agro-environmental benefits, mainly due to the potential increased concentration of heavy metal content in the biochar. Current study experimentally investigated co-pyrolysis of biosolids with alum sludge with an aim to produce high quality biochar with reduced heavy metal content. Moreover, it is further hypothesized that the addition of alum sludge may catalyze pyrolysis reactions, which may alter properties of pyrolysis products such as oil, gas and biochar. The results indicate that co-pyrolysis can reduce heavy metal concentrations in biochar while also improving oil and gas product qualities, suggesting beneficial synergistic effects. Furthermore, the process parameters such as pyrolysis temperature and alum sludge mixing ratio have a significant impact on the yield distribution and product (biochar, pyrolysis oil and gas) properties."

"The unintended consequences of strata title for urban regeneration Rise; Bodies Corporate; Housing Management This chapter explores the diffusion of strata title across Australian cities since the 1960s. Based on this review, we identify stages in the housing life cycle of strata-titled property and emerging pressures for redevelopment in greyfield areas of Australian cities. Drawing on data from an urban infill project, we argue that the spatial pervasiveness of smaller scale strata title development is acting as a major inhibitor to precinct-scale residential redevelopment. This is particularly evident in inner and middle suburbs, which in current metropolitan planning strategies are key targets for intensification of development. We conclude by placing Australian strata title development within a wider international context of current legal and planning instruments. Here we compare the positive and unintended negative consequences of contemporary approaches."

"Public Sector Accountability to Implement Sustainable Development Goals in Sri Lanka: Influence of Traditional and Non-Traditional Donors Decision Making; Social Impact Assessment; Environmental Impact Statements Implementation of Sustainable development Goals (SDGs) for better environmental sustainability in developing countries in Asia has taken centre stage in response to the major environmental and social degradation created through rapid economic development in the region. Further, lack of clarity in environmental accountability of traditional economic developmental activities and internationally funded infrastructure development projects has resulted in reduced water and air quality and imperilled biodiversity. SDG related research in developing country context is limited and the impact of the funding bodies on public sector governance and accountability is scarce. This paper aims to fill this gap by addressing environmental accountability of public sector entities in internationally funded development projects in Sri Lanka, as a fast-developing country in Asia. The results indicate that environmental degradation is a continuing issue in Sri Lanka despite the efforts of traditional donor agencies monitoring and implementing environmental sustainability guidelines and SDG principles in infrastructure projects. The drastic change in the donor landscape experienced in the country with the rise of non-traditional donors and the deficiencies in public sector governance and accountability structures pose a significant threat to attainment of SDGs, including environmental sustainability in Sri Lanka."

"Mathematical Modeling of Non-Premixed Laminar Flow Flames Fed with Biofuel in Counter-Flow Arrangement Considering Porosity and Thermophoresis Effects: An Asymptotic Approach Coal Dust; Flame Propagation; Explosion Due to the safe operation and stability of non-premixed combustion, it can widely be utilized in different engineering power and medical systems. The current paper suggests a mathematical asymptotic technique to describe non-premixed laminar flow flames formed in organic particles in a counter-flow configuration. In this investigation, fuel and oxidizer enter the combustor from opposite sides separately and multiple zones including preheating, vaporization, flame and post-flame zones were considered. Micro-sized lycopodium particles and air were respectively applied as a biofuel and an oxidizer. Dimensionalized and non-dimensionalized mass and energy conservation equations were determined for the zones and solved by Mathematica and Matlab software by applying proper boundary and jump conditions. Since lycopodium particles have numerous spores, the porosity of the particles was involved in the equations. Further, significant parameters such as lycopodium vaporization rate and thermophoretic force corresponding to the lycopodium particles in the solid phase were examined. The temperature distribution, flame sheet position, fuel and oxidizer mass fractions, equivalence ratio and flow strain rate were evaluated for the counter-flow non-premixed flames. Ultimately, the thermophoretic force caused by the temperature gradient at different positions was computed for several values of porosity, fuel and oxidizer Lewis numbers."

"Temporary uses of urban spaces: How are they understood as 'creative'? Prussia; Berlin Wall; Palace Analysis of the emergent theoretical, empirical, and planning policy studies of 'temporary uses' of derelict urban spaces in European cities illustrates three distinct realms where the concept of 'creativity' is defined and applied to urban management and redevelopment approaches: in terms of creative production, consumption of creativity, and creative governance. These concepts mesh together with a liberalization of urban planning and governance. Creative planning for temporary use suggests not just reducing the regulation of urban activity and built form, but transforming the aims and methods of planning itself to be more dynamic and more facilitative."
"Consumer fridge behaviour and waste reduction of red
 meat Greenleaf reported markdown and waste from the Australian beef supply chain is costing roughly $7.8 million p.a. (MLA, 2019). This is partly caused by short date labelling, based on data from a 1997 survey. Consumers predominately assess if meat is still safe by the date label, which is conservative because of outdated data, and appliance development and changing consumer behaviour over the last 20 years. We propose to conduct a two-phase project. In Phase 1 (this proposal), we will provide new temperature and consumer data for commodities requiring chilled storage to use for setting new standards and to provide information for industry and consumers. Adopting a holistic fridge/freezer, packaging, and consumer information/education approach, the project will help redress the problems above.
Based on the results of Phase 1, Phase 2 (not included in this proposal), will develop easy to understand and effective interventions to engage consumers in reducing meat waste. "

"Life cycle assessment of apparel consumption in Australia Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing This study presents the environmental impact of apparel consumption in Australia using life cycle assessment methodology according to ISO14040/14044:2006. Available published references, the Ecoinvent v3 dataset, the Australian life cycle assessment dataset and apparel country-wise import data with the breakdown of apparel type and fibre type were used in this study. The environmental impact assessment results of the functional unit were scaled up to the total apparel consumption. The impact results were also normalized on a per-capita/year basis. The Total Climate Change Potential (CCP) impact from apparel consumption of 2015 was estimated to be 16 607 028 tonnes CO2eq and 698.07 kg CO2eq/per capita-year. This study also assessed the impact of acidification potential (AP), water depletion (WD), abiotic resource depletion potential (ADP) - fossil fuel and agricultural land occupation (ALO) using the same methodology. The market volume of cotton apparel in Australia is 53.97 %, which accounts for 45 %, 96 %, 40 %, 46 % and 79 % of total CCP, WD, ADP, AP and ALO impact, respectively. Apparel broad categories of cotton shirt, cotton trouser, polyester shirt and polyester trouser have a high volume in the apparel market as well as a high environmental impact contribution. These high-volume apparel products can be included in the prioritization list to reduce environmental impact throughout the apparel supply chain. It was estimated that from 2010 to 2018 the per capita apparel consumption and corresponding impact increased by 24 %."

"Design and Optimization of a Hybrid Energy System for Sustainable Development at Rural Areas in Bangladesh Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems A limited amount of fossil fuel is not a sustainable solution for growing energy demand. Developing countries like Bangladesh face major challenges in meeting the energy demand of the countries that are being increasing day to day. This work aims to design and optimize a sustainable and cost-effective hybrid energy system for a rural area in Bangladesh. Available meteorological data was collected from the NASA Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (Power) database. The study area (24Â°26.6'N, 88Â°20.0'E) had an average wind speed of 4.28 m/s annually and solar irradiation of 4.88 kWh/m2/day annually. Design and optimization of the system were done using HOMER pro software in terms of COE and NPC. Three different configurations were analyzed to compare the COE and NPC. Results showed that the NPC and COE for the proposed system is much lower (0.238$/kWh and $349, 681) than the other two configurations, such as, PV/Wind (0.302/kWh and $442, 907) and PV/Diesel (0.295$/kWh and $432, 699). The main purpose of the proposed design is to supply maximum load demand using renewable energy sources with the least electricity cost. The optimized system can mitigate 88.7% load demand using renewable sources, and this reduces the CO2 emission by 89.17%."
"Our home is girt by seawalls? Preserving the public interest in an era of sea level rise Flood Risk; Flood Risk Management; Community Rating In this article we interview planners from local government authorities in Western Australia who are responsible for preparing coastal communities for the likely effects of sea level rise, to identify the preferences of these planners regarding the regulation of new coastal protection structures. We then examine how these preferences are likely to influence the achievement of the State coastal policyâ€™s public interest objectives. The article demonstrates that these planners have a clear preference against the long-term stabilisation of shorelines using hard structures, which aligns with the preferences outlined in the State policy. However, paradoxically, the current legislative and funding framework tends to encourage the continued adoption of protection measures to stabilise existing shoreline positions in order to maintain public beach amenity. In an era of sea level rise, this approach is likely to become increasingly unviable and undermine the achievement of State objectives. Recommendations are provided to help Western Australia achieve its public interest objectives."
"Energy poverty, children's wellbeing and the mediating role of academic performance: Evidence from China Subjective Well-Being; Happiness; Life Satisfaction Using data from the China Family Panel Studies, we examine the effects of energy poverty on children's subjective wellbeing. We find that energy poverty reduces children's subjective wellbeing: a standard deviation increase in energy poverty is associated with 0.353 standard deviation decrease in subjective wellbeing. This general conclusion is robust to alternative ways of measuring subjective wellbeing and energy poverty, a suite of estimation techniques, and other sensitivity checks. Additionally, we find that academic performance is an important channel through which energy poverty lowers children's subjective wellbeing. Our findings point out the need to involve children both in household practices and policy decisions that seek to address energy poverty, especially when it pertains to the children's wellbeing."

"The Cost Burden of Safety Risk Incidents on Construction: A Probabilistic Quantification Method Construction Safety; Occupational Accidents; Accident The construction sector is vulnerable to safety risk incidents due to its dynamic nature. Although numerous research efforts and technological advancements have focused on addressing workplace injuries, most of the studies perform empirical and deterministic postimpact evaluations on construction project performance. The effective modeling of the safety risk impacts on project performance provides decisionmakers with a valuable tool toward incidents prevention and proper safety risk management. Therefore, this study collected Australian incident records from the construction industry from 2016 onwards and conducted discrete event simulation to quantitatively measure the impact of safety risk incidents on project cost performance. Moreover, this study investigated the correlation between safety risk incidents and the age of injured workers. The findings show a strong correlation between the middle-aged workforce and the severity of incidents on project cost overruns. The ex-ante, nondeterministic analysis of safety risk impacts on project performance provides insightful results that will advance safety management theory in the direction of achieving zero harm workplace environments."
"‘She doesn’t think that happens’: When heterosexual men say no to sex Young; Sex Education; Sexuality Dominant understandings of menâ€™s sexuality claim that men are always up for sex; as such, research on heterosexual menâ€™s sexual refusals is sparse. Drawing on interviews conducted with young people (aged 18â€“23) living in and around Melbourne, Australia, this article explores three young peopleâ€™s experiences of men saying â€˜noâ€™ to a womanâ€™s request for sex within an ongoing relationship. In each of these instances the refusal was, to some extent, not respected. This presents a challenge to menâ€™s masculinity which then needs to be redressed through compensatory manhood acts. This article explores how the truth claims of hegemonic masculinity and the male sexual drive discourse are reproduced through men and womenâ€™s social interactions, and unpacks the implications of menâ€™s sexual refusals not being heard for sexual ethics education programmes."

"Direct contact membrane distillation for effective concentration of perfluoroalkyl substances – Impact of surface fouling and material stability Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ecotoxic amphiphilic compounds containing alkyl-fluorinated chains terminated with weak acid moieties, and hence difficult to be degraded or removed from water sources. Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) was used for concentrating and removing of perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) compounds from model contaminated water using commercially available poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) membranes. The membranes were characterised for surface morphology, roughness, contact angle and pore size distribution before and after the DCMD test to investigate and evaluate membrane fouling. During the DCMD test performed for 6 h using 10 ppm PFPeA solution, the membrane exhibited progressive increased flux (from 17 to 43 kg mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1) and decreased PFPeA rejection (from 85 to 58%), as the feed temperature was increased from 50 to 70 Â°C. Further, the feed/retentate side showed a 1.8, 2.1 and 2.8-fold increase in PFPeA concentration tested at feed temperatures 50, 60, and 70 Â°C, respectively. The permeate side contained less than 1 ppm of PFPeA revealing that the PFPeA moved across the PTFE membrane during DCMD, which is attributed to progressive surface diffusion over time. This study opens a new route to concentrate and remove amphiphilic molecules, such as PFAS, from source points, relevant to landfill leachates or surface waters. The study also points at gaps in materials science and surface engineering to be tackled to deal with PFAS compounds efficiently."

"Towards Sustainable Environmental Quality: Priority Research Questions for the Australasian Region of Oceania Ethinylestradiol; Endocrine Disruptors; Wastewater Treatment Environmental challenges persist across the world, including the Australasian region of Oceania, where biodiversity hotspots and unique ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef are common. These systems are routinely affected by multiple stressors from anthropogenic activities, and increasingly influenced by global megatrends (e.g., the foodâ€“energyâ€“water nexus, demographic transitions to cities) and climate change. Here we report priority research questions from the Global Horizon Scanning Project, which aimed to identify, prioritize, and advance environmental quality research needs from an Australasian perspective, within a global context. We employed a transparent and inclusive process of soliciting key questions from Australasian members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. Following submission of 78 questions, 20 priority research questions were identified during an expert workshop in Nelson, New Zealand. These research questions covered a range of issues of global relevance, including research needed to more closely integrate ecotoxicology and ecology for the protection of ecosystems, increase flexibility for prioritizing chemical substances currently in commerce, understand the impacts of complex mixtures and multiple stressors, and define environmental quality and ecosystem integrity of temporary waters. Some questions have specific relevance to Australasia, particularly the uncertainties associated with using toxicity data from exotic species to protect unique indigenous species. Several related priority questions deal with the theme of how widely international ecotoxicological data and databases can be applied to regional ecosystems. Other timely questions, which focus on improving predictive chemistry and toxicology tools and techniques, will be important to answer several of the priority questions identified here. Another important question raised was how to protect local cultural and social values and maintain indigenous engagement during problem formulation and identification of ecosystem protection goals. Addressing these questions will be challenging, but doing so promises to advance environmental sustainability in Oceania and globally."

"Circularity Assessment using the un 2030 Agenda Indicators Industrial Symbiosis; Sustainable Development; Circular Economy Established in 2015, the One Planet Sustainable Buildings and Construction (SBC) Programme has studied the state of play for circular built environment in different regions: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East, North America and Oceania. One aspect of this study has been assessment for circularity using the 2030 Agenda indicators. This paper describes how nature's resources are used in buildings to provide more comfortable and healthier spaces while generating less waste and emissions with the aim to change linear processes to circular, thereby increasing resource efficiency and reducing waste and emissions, while also providing local jobs. A set of core indicators have been selected to assess the circularity at global and regional levels. It is intended that the indicators selected for SBC become a starting point for prioritising the built environment sector to embrace circularity principles and practices."

"Tackling obesity in aged-care homes: the effects of environmental cues Malnutrition; Nutrition Risk Assessment; Hospital Patients Purpose: Obesity among elderly consumers precipitates undesirable health outcomes. This study aims to investigate the effects of environmental cues on food intake of elderly consumers in an aged-care facility. Design/methodology/approach: A longitudinal study conducted over 17 weeks in situ within an aged-care facility with 31 residents investigated how auditory (soothing music), olfactory (floral-scented candle) and visual (infographic on health benefits of the main meal component) cues influenced food intake quantity during a meal, while accounting for portion size effect (PSE). Findings: Analysing the cross-sectional results of individual treatments and rounds did not reveal any consistent patterns in the influence of the three environmental cues. Longitudinal analyses, however, showed that the presence of auditory and olfactory cues significantly increased food intake, but the visual cue did not. Moreover, PSE was strong. Research limitations/implications: Extending research into environmental factors from a commercial to a health-care setting, this study demonstrates how the presence of auditory and olfactory, but not cognitive cues, increased food intake behaviour among elderly consumers. It also shows that a cross-sectional approach to such studies would have yielded inconclusive or even misleading findings. Merely serving more would also lead to higher food intake amount. Practical implications: Environmental factors should be a part of health-care providersâ€™ arsenal to manage obesity. They are practical and relatively inexpensive to implement across different health-care settings. However, the same environmental factors would have opposite desired-effects with normal or underweight residents, and hence, aged-care facilities need to separate the dining experience (or mealtime) of obese and other residents. Quantity served should also be moderated to discourage overeating. Originality/value: While studies into managing obesity, particularly among older adults, have mainly focused on techniques such as pharmacotherapy treatments with drugs, dietary management or even lifestyle change, less attention has been given to the influence of environmental cues. This study, executed in situ within an aged-care facility, provided evidence of the importance of considering the impact of environmental factors on food intake to help reduce obesity."

"Understanding opportunities for social impact investment in the development of affordable housing Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Key findings This is the first study examining the opportunities for, barriers to, and risks for SII in the development of affordable housing in Australia. It considers both social housing and affordable housing supply. Social impact investment (SII) SIIs are those that intentionally target specific social objectives along with a financial return and measure the achievement of both (SIIT 2014a: 2). SII funds can be placed directly by investors or through intermediaries who specialise (sometimes exclusively) in placing SII funds. Intermediaries often, but not always, pool funds. Intermediaries take responsibility for measuring and reporting of impact. The return expectations and assets classes can differ: investors willing to accept concessionary returns (i.e. a below market return) are considered 'impact-first' investors while those requiring non-concessionary returns equal or near equal to market are considered to be 'finance-first' investors (Brest and Born 2013). Deals can be complex, involving other SI investors, concessionary and non-concessionary investment, non-SI investors and philanthropic and other grants. Such deals are termed 'layered' investments. Investment can involve debt, equity or both. The SI investors Westpac Banking Corporation, Community Sector Banking and Bank Australia are the largest SI investors in social and affordable housing in Australia, by virtue of lending to CHPs. Westpac has $1.05 billion invested in the CHP sector (Westpac 2016). Total bank SII in the CHP sector is possibly as much as $1.5 billion at present. This investment is all debt investment. Returns are non-concessionary. Historically, access to capital has been difficult for CHPs and investment has required reconsideration of risk and a shift in credit assessment. This change may or may not have been led by SI investors (further research would be required to answer this question). The participation of bank SI investors however adds competition ensuring all CHPs gain more competitively priced capital and more suitable conditions on finance. Given the concentration of the Australian banking sector (Bryant 2012) this competition is important. This bank SII therefore could be said to be providing 'additionality'. A far smaller $20 million is invested in housing models outside of the registered CHP sector, by non-bank SI investors. These include the Lord Mayors Charitable Foundation (LMCF) who provided $3 million to the Affordable Housing Loan Fund (AHLF), small superannuation funds, high net worth individuals (HNWI), other individuals, philanthropy, self-managed superannuation funds (SMSF), and not-for-profit (NFP) organisations. This $20 million is equal parts debt and equity investment. The equity investors in these models were the only investors to accept concessionary returns. They were supporting innovative models that have the potential for systemic change rather than simply providing housing. Intermediaries Three intermediaries, Foresters Community Finance (FCF), Social Enterprise Finance Australia (SEFA) and Social Ventures Australia (SVA) are currently responsible for the placement of the majority of non-bank SII in social/affordable housing in Australia. These intermediaries have attracted funds from HNWI, NAB, Triodos Bank, Community Sector Banking, Christian Super, HESTA, and the NSW Aboriginal Land Council. These intermediaries are highly respected. All three funds were established following an Australian Government initiative, the Social Enterprise Development and Investment Funds (SEDIFs) that provided $20 million in matched funding. Christian Super recently established its own intermediary, Bright Light. Demand side for investment CHPs are the largest source of demand for funds and represent the only established system of social and affordable housing provision that comprises an at-scale opportunity for expanded SII, which meets the requirements for verifiable impact over time. The opportunity for SII is limited however by CHP sector constraints (issues well documented, see Milligan, Hulse, et al. 2013; Milligan, Pawson et al. 2017) including limited free cash flow (to support borrowings), uncertain tenant housing assistance and income support, and reduced discretion over tenant allocation. Government policy change is viewed as a key source of risk affecting investment (current and future). Two other models were able to access mainstream finance but were not part of the CHP sector. There were a number of organisations currently outside the CHP sector unable to access mainstream lending. These projects span income cohorts-from households eligible for public housing to middle income households-and provide both rental and home ownership opportunities. These non-CHP models expressed dissatisfaction with the existing CHP model and with market provision. A new SII typology SII in Australia does not fit the simple impact-first versus finance-first investment typology found in the literature. Investor reconceptualisation of risk and modification of lending practices occurred in addition to consideration of return requirements. This was not a case of accepting greater risk but rather of reviewing the generally accepted credit assessment practice. Figure 1 describes this new Australian SII typology, which adds whether the investor adopted an orthodox or 'reformed' approach to credit assessment in addition to their approach to returns. Using this new typology, we find that most SII in Australia can be described as partial finance-first, reflecting a combination of non-concessionary returns and modified investment parameters. A far smaller proportion of SII is full impact-first, in that concessionary returns were acceptable and investment parameters were modified. We found no fully finance-first or partial impact-first investment. Barriers and opportunities The CHP sector is the target of most SII, and most existing and potential SI investors wish to see the sector greatly expanded. Government capital grants are regarded as necessary to grow the sector and enable SII at a greater scale. Investment is currently constrained by the lack of CHP free cash flow, rather than lack of collateral required for security. Adverse changes to welfare and housing assistance, and government policy restricting housing allocations to the highest priority applicants on public housing waiting lists were identified as affecting CHP cash flow and as such presenting a risk to investment. Policy development options SII in social and affordable housing reflects government investment. As private investment, there is an expectation of returns on investment. Investment therefore only occurs when the housing organisation is able to generate a positive cash flow to support debt repayment or disbursements to equity holders. This requires the gap between tenant's capacity to pay and the cost of housing provision to be funded by government. The funding of this gap provides an implicit government guarantee. In the Australian context, this requires: â€¢ An annual funding stream for CHPs to close the gap between rental revenues and cost of provision. â€¢ State and territory governments to permit CHPs discretion in who they house so that investor confidence can be maintained (in the absence of a funding stream to meet the gap between rental revenues and cost of provision). â€¢ An annual capital grants program for CHPs to grow the sector. â€¢ Growth of the sector to create the conditions for bond financing-bonds lower the cost of capital and provide for long tenure debt. â€¢ Welfare entitlements and housing assistance to provide sufficient income to all household types to ensure the most vulnerable households will be attractive to house. Social security entitlements need to be stable in order to provide confidence to investors regarding their existing investments as well as future investments. Housing supply bonds were viewed as a key opportunity for reducing the cost of capital and enabling long tenure debt. Land is a critical issue affecting affordability of housing and access to employment and services by vulnerable households. â€¢ Government are frequently owners of well-located land that is surplus to their requirements. Governments could grant such surplus government land to CHPs (as is envisaged by part 21(k) of the National Affordable Housing Agreement (NAHA)). â€¢ Inclusionary zoning could be implemented to provide a new source of social and affordable housing on existing redevelopment sites. Inclusionary zoning would provide the opportunity for layered investment models, common in the US. â€¢ Governments could consider capturing the uplift in value when re-zoning land, through making part of rezoned sites available to CHPs or other NFP housing providers. SII in new home ownership models is able to generate affordable housing supply for both low-income and intermediate income cohorts. The growth of some of these models could be assisted through: â€¢ Government guarantees to permit debt financing and negate the need for substantial equity contributions. â€¢ Revolving funds to provide equity to development projects. The equity would be returned once mortgage loans are issued. The market price of housing for purchase is affected by many factors. However, there has been little scrutiny of the development process and particularly of multi-unit residential development. Profit margins in this sector are high, suggesting competition is less effective than it could be. There is a need for policy-makers to gain a detailed understanding of residential property development and possible industry reforms to improve efficiency. SII would be assisted by: â€¢ As fiduciary duties of superannuation fund managers appear to be open to interpretation, government could review this aspect of superannuation fund management to provide legal clarity for concessionary SII. The study This report presents findings from a research project conducted as part of a broader AHURI Inquiry into social impact investment for housing and homelessness outcomes (Muir, Findlay et al. forthcoming). The purpose of this research is to investigate what contribution SII can make to increasing the supply of affordable housing through providing a detailed analysis of: i) SII in affordable housing internationally and in Australia, ii) opportunities and risks for SII in Australia, iii) barriers to investment, iv) potential for innovation and v) measures government and other parties can take to encourage investment. To date there has been no review of SII in the development of social and affordable housing in Australia. While SII is increasingly of interest in relation to homelessness and housing vulnerability, its application to housing supply has not attracted the same kind of policy attention, despite international and Australian examples. Little therefore is known of investments, the quantum of investment, who the investors are, their motivations or the impact arising from their investment. The registered CHP sector is often presumed to constitute the demand for SII funds. Intermediaries have been established, and many are keen to funnel SII into housing. Much of the advocacy for SII has centred on superannuation funds and on housing supply bonds as a means to attract superannuation funds with CHPs. It is a discussion that reflects a deep concern about the lack of affordable housing stock and mounting frustration at the lack of opportunities for investment. In order to appreciate the implications of private investment including SII, in the supply of social and affordable housing it is necessary to understand residential development financing, and specifically project finance. As we will outline however, private investment in social and affordable housing is not a straightforward matter. This research involved: â€¢ a review of national and international literature on SII in affordable housing â€¢ analysis of in-depth interviews with experts in government, and with SI investors and intermediaries, and CHPs about the definition of SII, its purpose in relation to social/affordable housing, how it has been applied and its benefits in regard to the supply of social and affordable housing in Australia."

"Bring one keynote speaker to the Australian Gender Economics Workshop, Melbourne, VIC, 13-15 February 2019 The AGEW conference will demonstrate RMIT’s commitment to supporting high quality academic research to address issues of social and economic concern. Namely, RMIT aims to contribute to developing the research evidence base needed to better understand the factors that give rise to gender differentials in society and identify the policies and approaches that can be used to address gender inequalities.
The conference will also solidify RMIT’s support of the co-hosting organisation, the Women in Economics Network (WEN) which advocates for the greater representation and involvement of women in the economics profession and policymaking environment.
While many organisations in society today aspire to achieve gender equality, it is clear that barriers persist.
This accentuates the need for the research and policy community to synergistically pool together our knowledge and insights, and collectively build research-based evidence about “what works” in addressing gender inequality, and what needs to be done, and to communicate these findings publicly. Economics offers the data-driven methods and analytical tools to contribute to this evidence base. RMIT would be proud to take a leading role in this initiative through AGEW.
AGEW will also provide the environment in which researchers and policy analysts can share their insights in direct conversation with policy makers and organisational leaders, which is a critical element in the translation of research knowledge into outcomes. This aligns strongly with RMIT’s mission to foster research that is practically-oriented and will generate real-world impact for the betterment of society."

"Institutionalizing virtual reality based construction professional training Construction Sites; Monitoring; Point Cloud Applying Virtual Reality (VR) in construction professional training has been advocated as an effective method to improve learnerâ€™s cognition. However, there has been a lack of a systematic approach in VR-based training in the construction context. This study aims to develop a framework to institutionalize VR-based construction professional training design. Virtual Generation and Experience Road Map (VGERM) was adopted in the development of the mobile VR app for use in teaching substructure in an undergraduate construction technology course. A mobile VR app was developed by using a Unity-based platform, namely EduVenture. Procedures of the VR app development were articulated with an aim to demonstrate how the proposed framework can be utilized in fostering knowledge and skills transfer. Feedback of the users was collected through the Course Experience Survey. Findings of this study help gain a better understanding of the key areas to foster the benefits of VR for efficient use within professional construction training."

"Microfinance and child mortality Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion Microfinance institutions (MFIs) offer targeted opportunities for the poor to generate additional income with a range of financial services including credit, insurance, savings accounts and money transfers. Aside from reducing poverty, microfinance can potentially improve health because it is the poor who are usually more constrained from health investments due to limited budgets. Furthermore, microfinancing specifically targets women, who are more likely to spend additional income on childrenâ€™s well-being. Finally, several MFIs have also begun to offer health-related services, such as health education, health-care financing, clinical care, training community health workers, health micro-insurance and linkages to public and private health providers. Using a new data set, this article conducts the first multi-country study of the effect of microfinance on child mortality, the health outcome, which is most sensitive to the effects of absolute deprivation. Our findings confirm that an increase in the proportion of MFI clients in a country is significantly associated with lower under-five and infant mortality rates. We conclude that if MFIsâ€™ educational and health services have indeed caused improvements in health outcomes at the community level, then it may be important for governments to complement these activities with similar campaigns, particularly in remote areas where MFI penetration is low."
"Life cycle costing of municipal food waste management systems: The effect of environmental externalities and transfer costs using local government case studies Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste Municipal food waste is of growing interest worldwide as governments strive to reduce wastesâ€™ environmental impact. For local governments responsible for waste collection, treatment and disposal; finding an affordable management and treatment solution with the smallest impact on the environment is paramount. This paper introduces a life cycle costing tool, incorporating both an Environmental LCC and Societal LCC to provide decision support to local government. The tool was tested on two case study waste catchments; comparing seven unique food waste management systems. Results indicated that food waste anaerobic digestion or co-digestion, shown to have smaller environmental impacts, can be implemented with marginal increase (1.7% to 11.6%) in overall cost. Moreover, with efficiencies food waste anaerobic digestion systems can demonstrate the same cost as business-as-usual. Composting systems were also revealed to have consistently lower costs per household across case studies than business-as-usual, although environmental impacts were generally higher than digestion systems. Further analysis determined the required rate of policy incentives (i.e. landfill levy, electricity tariffs and carbon credits) to promote various alternative food waste management systems."

"A review of dry sanitation systems Sludge Treatment; Toilet Facilities; Sewage Dry sanitation systems (waterless or composting toilets) have been used since the 1970s. Their use has received acceptance in rural regions of Europe and the United States. Some of the advantages of dry sanitation systems include their waterless nature, their low energy requirement and the creation of fertilizer as an added value product. Moreover, the use of such a system is a sustainable sanitation approach that may reduce the burden on infrastructure and provide sanitation to the 2.5 billion people worldwide who do not currently have access to it. The critical factors when choosing a dry sanitation system and their optimum parameters include aeration, moisture content (50%â€“60%), temperature (40â€“65â—¦C), carbon to nitrogen ratio (25â€“35), pH (5.5â€“8.0) and porosity (35%â€“50%). The temperatureâ€“time criterion approach is the most common method used to evaluate the stability and safety of the compost as a fertilizer. The risks of handling the waste after 12 months of composting have been calculated as low. Here, we have reviewed and assessed the features of dry sanitation systems currently available, focusing on those designed for and operated in remote areas such as national parks and tourist destinations and, more importantly, in rural areas in developing countries or refugee shelters where water/sanitation may be scarce."

"The capacity to consent to sex in mental health inpatient units Severe Mental Illness; Mental Patient; HIV Infection Objective: Discussions of capacity to consent in mental health care usually revolve around capacity to consent to treatment. This paper instead explores the issue of capacity to consent to sexual activity in a mental health inpatient setting as a way of exploring capacity from a different perspective. This is not a purely theoretical exercise, with both consensual sexual activity and sexual assault commonplace in mental health inpatient units, current policy and practice approaches are clearly not working and require re-examination. Methods: Four key frameworks are explored: human rights law, mental health law, the criminal law and the law of tort governing the duty of care. These frameworks are explored by highlighting relevant case law and statutes and considering their potential application in practice. This is undertaken using the state of Victoria, Australia, as a case study. Results: The four frameworks are shown to be consistent with each other but inconsistent with contemporary policy. All four legal frameworks explored require clinicians to take a case-by-case assessment to ensure that a personâ€™s right to make their own decisions is preserved â€˜unless the contrary is demonstrably justifiedâ€™ or where it is â€˜legally demandedâ€™. While Victorian inpatient units attempt to enforce a blanket ban on consensual sexual activity in inpatient settings, this ban may be without legal basis and may be in breach of both human rights and mental health law. Conclusion: In policing the lawful bodily interactions of their patients and pushing sexual activity out of sight, clinicians may be breaching their duty of care to provide sexual health support and risk creating an environment in which the therapeutic relationship will be sacrificed to the enforcement of institutional policy. Clinicians and policymakers must understand the relevant legal frameworks to ensure that they are acting ethically and lawfully."
