"Integration of a UAV-LIDAR System for Remote Sensing of CO concentrations in Smart Agriculture Stripe Rust; Plant Leaves; Puccinia Striiformis Precision agriculture is reliant on making timely, effective measurements to optimize workflow and crop yield. Manual inspection techniques are time consuming and do not support a frequent and autonomous monitoring of the field. This paper examines an innovative application of using a bistatic LIDAR sensor integrated into a UAV to monitor in-field CO concentrations. Measuring variations in atmospheric CO concentrations in agriculture can be used to detect plant health through correlation of photosynthesis efficiency and used to determine soil quality. LIDAR systems can maintain highly accurate measurements, particularly of small changes in CO concentrations, from substantial distances, making it ideal for remote UAV monitoring. Integration of such system into the UAV requires resolving mechanical, electrical, communication computing and control aspects, which are addressed in this paper through a feasibility study of the ground station tracking the system to steer the gimbal, on which the sensor is mounted. There is substantial interest in determining the appropriate UAV platform and consequently the hardware and software architecture and integration into the UAS."
"Work-integrated learning in university popular music programmes: Localised approaches to vocational curricula in Melbourne, Australia and Wellington, Aotearoa/New Zealand Adventure; Experiential Education; Place This article investigates the possibilities of a vocational pedagogy for undergraduate popular music education which is grounded in site and city. The value of work-integrated curricula in tertiary music environments is well established; however, often absent from such discussions is consideration of how geospatial contexts mediate the opportunities and resources available to universities. In response, we provide a critical comparison of how work-integrated learning (WIL) has been developed in two undergraduate popular music degrees in Australia and Aotearoa/New Zealand. Through comparison, we consider how the geographic locations of both programmes have shaped WIL, as well as identifying the specific economic, cultural and political tensions that emerge."

"AN INVESTIGATION OF THE ATTITUDES OF BUSINESS TAXPAYERS TOWARDS THE MALAYSIAN GOODS AND SERVICES TAX AND ITS POTENTIAL MANAGERIAL BENEFITS Tax Compliance; Taxation; Income The Malaysian Goods and Services Tax (â€˜GSTâ€™) was implemented in April 2015 to replace the Sales and Services Tax (â€˜SSTâ€™), as part of the Malaysian tax reform, which was aimed at reducing the countryâ€™s budget deficit by improving its revenue collection system. This study is part of a major project that investigated the start-up compliance costs of GST for Malaysian business taxpayers. Sixty-eight questionnaires were received from businesses that were registered for GST. This research applied the Theory of Planned Behaviour model to investigate business taxpayersâ€™ attitudes towards the Malaysian GST and its potential managerial benefits. A five-point Likert attitude scale was employed to measure the attitudes of businesses towards the introduction of the GST in Malaysia. Prior studies report that Malaysian business enterprises incurred high mean gross GST start-up compliance costs. The findings of this investigation confirm that there is a direct relationship between business attitudes towards GST compliance and start-up compliance costs. Overall, respondents strongly disagreed with the statement â€˜I do not mind doing GST workâ€™. Further, those who indicated that GST is unreasonably complicated, reported higher average GST start-up compliance costs. Counter-intuitively, businesses that supported the governmentâ€™s tax reform also incurred higher average GST start-up compliance costs. This study found that some businesses derived managerial benefits from complying with the GST. The managerial benefits include improved accounting information systems, improved controls to prevent theft and fraud, as well as savings in accounting costs by using internal staff to maintain records. Surprisingly, businesses that expected to derive managerial benefits incurred higher costs than those who did not expect to receive such benefits. This paper concludes with some policy implications for Malaysia and possibly for other countries yet to introduce a GST."

"Bringing nature back into cities Urban Biodiversity; Urbanization; Birds Protecting nature is a fundamental aspect of local and Indigenous cultures that has more recently become an urban sustainability goal. The benefits provided by nature to people and other species have sparked an upsurge in research exploring how best to manage existing nature in urban environments. Here we expand this focus by drawing attention to an emerging pathway of research and practice that is engaged with the idea of bringing nature back into cities (BNB). We argue that BNB could be a vital force of the 21st century urban-sustainability agenda. However, the enthusiasm of practitioners and policymakers for incorporating BNB objectives into local and global strategies remains uneven. As interdisciplinary scholars involved with the theory and practice of caring for urban nature, we believe that the time is ripe to present a fresh perspective on seven key areas that can unlock the potential of actions to bring nature back into cities. Specifically, we: (a) argue that the sovereignty of local and Indigenous knowledge-systems be acknowledged and respected; (b) contend that the choice of bringing nature back actions should be driven by inclusive decision-making; (c) discuss advances in ecology that need to be addressed to facilitate the return of nature into cities; (d) outline how the diffusion of innovation theory may assist communication of BNB actions to stakeholders; (e) discuss how built-environment professionals can demonstrate the value of urban infrastructure for BNB; (f) call for longitudinal research to understand, quantify and qualify the benefits of BNB actions and (g) consider solutions needed to address concerns about potential risks and disservices associated with actions to bring nature back into urban environments. Taken together, these perspectives, and the transdisciplinary framework that emerges from them, embody theoretical innovation regarding how to bring nature back into cities and a holistic view of how to make this happen in practice. Bringing nature back into cities has the potential to become an environmentally just and culturally inclusive dimension of the 21st urban sustainability agenda upon which future generations of city-dwellers rely.

"A study of sustainable practices in the sustainability leadership of international contractors Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative With an increasing global need for sustainable development, numerous world-leading construction corporations have devoted significant efforts to implementing sustainable practices. However, few previous studies have shared these valuable experiences in a systematic and quantitative way. RobecoSAM has published The Sustainability Yearbook annually since 2004, which lists the sustainability leaders in various industries, including the construction industry. Learning from those sustainability leaders in the construction industry can provide useful references for construction-related companies when developing their sustainable development strategies. Based on a comprehensive literature review, this paper identified 51 methods used for improving sustainability performance and 34 outcomes achieved via these methods. These methods and outcomes are used for coding the sustainable practices of sustainability leaders in the construction sector. Using the coding system, 133 annual sustainability reports issued by 22 sustainability leaders (The Sustainability Yearbook, RobecoSAM 2010â€“2016) in the construction sector were analyzed using content analysis. Social network analysis was then employed to identify the key adopted methods and achieved outcomes (KAMAO) of these leaders. The dynamic trend and regional analysis of KAMAO are also presented. These KAMAO findings provide valuable guidance for international contractors to develop a better understanding of the primary sustainable methods adopted by sustainability leaders in the construction sector and the top outcomes achieved by these leaders. The findings also provide a useful reference for international contractors to evaluate their current sustainability-related strategies and make improvements."

"Temperature shocks and energy poverty: Findings from Vietnam Energy; Energy Poverty; Fuelwood Globally, billions of people live in energy poverty without the means to access affordable and clean energy which are fundamental to sustainable development. Climate change is aggravating increasing demand for energy through a general rise in temperatures as well as through short periods of unusually high heat. This paper examines the impact of temperature shocks on energy poverty in Vietnam. Using data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (2010 to 2016) and data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts it finds temperature shocks lead to increases in a measure of multidimensional energy poverty. This finding is robust to different measures of temperature shocks. Households in the North and Central coast regions of Vietnam are most prone to the impacts of temperature shocks as well as households located in rural areas. Further findings suggest that temperature shocks impact on energy poverty through reducing agricultural output."

"A state-of-the-art review on the durability of geopolymer concrete for sustainable structures and infrastructure Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali The need for sustainable and environmentally friendly concrete for construction has resulted in the development of low carbon concretes such as geopolymer concrete. Geopolymer concrete replaces cement with industrial waste materials i.e., utilizes fly ash and slag for its mixture along with the addition of a small quantity of alkali activator required for the geopolymerization process. There is a large number of articles published on the mix proportion, workability, strength and material properties of geopolymer concrete (GPC) in the last 15â€“20 years. However, research on the durability of the reinforcing steel in various types of geopolymer concrete is limited and found to be contradictory with ordinary portland cement concrete (OPC) in literature. This paper presents a critical and updated review of the literature on the durability of GPC published between 1990 and 2020. A simple and systematic methodology including Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) and Meta-Analyses procedures were adopted with modifications for this review. The review is divided into six key sections after the introductory section to have a holistic understanding of the durability of GPC and to highlight gaps for future research. The first section presents the review of recent articles that purely investigate the development of microstructure of various types of GPC. The second section reviews studies on the repairs of reinforced concrete by GPC. The third section covers articles on the durability of GPC against acids, chlorides, freeze and thaw, and temperature effects. The fourth section reviews studies on the structural performance of GPC specimens when subjected to corrosive environments. The penultimate section reports gaps, opportunities and potential areas of future research on the durability of GPC. Finally, the conclusions summarise the findings of the review."
"Education and care for children three – six years in Australia and China – pedagogical perspectives Values Education; Nursery Schools; Communicative Action Similar to the research in Chap. 5, which explored educatorâ€™s perspectives of childrenâ€™s learning in the infant/toddler years, this study investigated the perspective of early childhood educators in Australia and China on childrenâ€™s learning and optimal conditions for learning for preschool children. The same structured questionnaire used for the infant/toddler study was also conducted in both countries and four main questions were investigated; what situations can be characterized as learning? What activities are important for learning? What are the best conditions for childrenâ€™s learning? How do early childhood educators understand participation in relation to childrenâ€™s learning? Internationalization of education has seen relationships develop between countries and an exploration of educatorâ€™ theories on children and learning can provide a nuanced approach to comparative research. The findings suggest there is significant sharing of ideas as well as important differences across the contexts of Australia and China."

"Social inequalities in mobility during and following the COVID-19 associated lockdown of the Madrid metropolitan area in Spain ARIMA; Mathematical Modeling; COVID-19 Spain has been one of the most affected regions by the COVID-19 worldwide, and Madrid its most affected city. In response to this, the Spanish government enacted a strict lockdown in late March 2020, that was gradually eased until June 2020. We explored differentials in mobility by area-level deprivation in the functional area of Madrid, before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. We used cell phone-derived mobility indicators (% of the population leaving their area) from the National Institute of Statistics (INE), and a composite measure of deprivation from the Spanish Society of Epidemiology (SEE). We computed changes in mobility with respect to pre-pandemic levels, and explored spatial patterns and associations with deprivation. We found that levels of mobility before COVID-19 were slightly higher in areas with lower deprivation. The economic hibernation period resulted in very strong declines in mobility, most acutely in low deprivation areas. These differences weakened during the re-opening, and levels of mobility were similar by deprivation once the lockdown was completely lifted. Given the existence of important socioeconomic differentials in COVID-19 exposure, it is key to ensure that these interventions do not widen existing social inequalities."
"Active and passive drug release by self-assembled lubricin (PRG4) anti-fouling coatings Lubricin; Articular Cartilage; Hydrogel Electroactive polymers (EAPs) have been investigated as materials for use in a range of biomedical applications, ranging from cell culture, electrical stimulation of cultured cells as well as controlled delivery of growth factors and drugs. Despite their excellent drug delivery ability, EAPs are susceptible to biofouling thus they often require surface functionalisation with antifouling coatings to limit unwanted non-specific protein adsorption. Here we demonstrate the surface modification of para toluene sulfonate (pTS) doped polypyrrole with the glycoprotein lubricin (LUB) to produce a self-assembled coating that both prevents surface biofouling while also serving as a high-capacity reservoir for cationic drugs which can then be released passively via diffusion or actively via an applied electrical potential. We carried out our investigation in two parts where we initially assessed the antifouling and cationic drug delivery ability of LUB tethered on a gold surface using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM) to monitor molecular interactions occurring on a gold sensor surface. After confirming the ability of tethered LUB nano brush layers on a gold surface, we introduced an electrochemically grown EAP layer to act as the immobilisation surface for LUB before subsequently introducing the cationic drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX). The release of cationic drug was then investigated under passive and electrochemically stimulated conditions. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was then carried out to quantify the amount of DOX released. It was shown that the amount of DOX released from nano brush layers of LUB tethered on gold and EAP surfaces could be increased by up to 30% per minute by applying a positive electrochemically stimulating pulse at 0.8 V for one minute. Using bovine serum albumin (BSA), we show that DOX loaded LUB tethered on para toluene sulfonic acid (pTS) doped polypyrrole retained antifouling ability of up to 75% when compared to unloaded tethered LUB. This work demonstrates the unique, novel ability of tethered LUB to actively participate in the delivery of cationic therapeutics on different substrate surfaces. This study could lead to the development of versatile multifunctional biomaterials for use in wide range of biomedical applications, such as dual drug delivery and lubricating coatings, dual drug delivery and antifouling coatings, cellular recording and stimulation."

"Ablation performances of additively manufactured high-temperature thermoplastic polymers Flammability; Epoxide; Fiber-Reinforced Composite In this study, high-temperature thermoplastic polymers including two types of polyetherimide (PEI), two types of polyether ether ketone (PEEK), and one type of polyether ketone ketone (PEKK) were 3D printed using Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and evaluated for thermal and ablation performances. Among all tested materials, PEKK exhibits the highest char yield while the two PEEKs exhibit the highest thermal decomposition temperature. Although PEI has the lowest onset decomposition temperature, Microscale Combustion Calorimeter (MCC) results indicating it has the lowest heat release properties which is an indication of low flammability. Four durations (15s, 30s, 60s, and 120s) were used for oxy-acetylene testbed (OTB) ablation testing at 100W/cm2. All five materials were able to keep its original shape up to 60s but experienced various amounts of intumescent or swelling behavior. At longer flame exposure times, samples experienced greater mass loss among which PEKK showed the highest char yield. SEM of the char and pyrolysis zones revealed highly porous char structures caused by the rapid heating condition and thus the fast generation of the volatile decomposition products. Additional ablation testing with various sample sizes was performed using ICP. The 30s duration ICP results showed no significant difference from the OTB results, which indicates that the intumescent effect was not caused by any chemical reaction."

"Multiple Primary Tumours – Genetic Susceptibility, Metastasis and Survival (administered by WEHI) As the annual number of new cancer cases is projected to rise from 18 million in 2018 to 29 million in 2040, it is urgent that we contain the risk of cancer. Developing a second primary tumour is a major clinical problem with second cancers making up 14% of all incident
malignancies in the US [2]. As survival rates for cancer improve, more people will develop second primary tumours. Currently 12% of breast cancer cases develop a second primary tumour. Cancer survivors have a 14% higher risk of developing a new malignancy than
expected in the general population. However, strikingly and somewhat unexpectedly, those who develop three or more multiple primary cancers have less aggressive malignancies, presenting at earlier stages, some with strong family histories. This suggests a genetic
susceptibility but also an ability to control the cancers they do develop. Indeed, their immune system may be more crucial than their cancer type or even their cancer predisposition syndrome. We propose to study the immune system of patients who develop three or more primary tumours, representing more than 20 tumour types in our cohort and who we suggest:
• are a cohort of individuals who are able to control cancer metastasis across cancer types
• because their immune system may be responding to control their cancers, despite these cancer types being of lethal type. It is noted that when they develop three or more tumours, each of these tumours is diagnosed at an early stage and cured, prior to the development of advanced disease, strikingly, allowing them to live to the same age as population controls."

"Direct contact membrane distillation for effective concentration of perfluoroalkyl substances – Impact of surface fouling and material stability Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ecotoxic amphiphilic compounds containing alkyl-fluorinated chains terminated with weak acid moieties, and hence difficult to be degraded or removed from water sources. Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) was used for concentrating and removing of perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) compounds from model contaminated water using commercially available poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) membranes. The membranes were characterised for surface morphology, roughness, contact angle and pore size distribution before and after the DCMD test to investigate and evaluate membrane fouling. During the DCMD test performed for 6 h using 10 ppm PFPeA solution, the membrane exhibited progressive increased flux (from 17 to 43 kg mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1) and decreased PFPeA rejection (from 85 to 58%), as the feed temperature was increased from 50 to 70 Â°C. Further, the feed/retentate side showed a 1.8, 2.1 and 2.8-fold increase in PFPeA concentration tested at feed temperatures 50, 60, and 70 Â°C, respectively. The permeate side contained less than 1 ppm of PFPeA revealing that the PFPeA moved across the PTFE membrane during DCMD, which is attributed to progressive surface diffusion over time. This study opens a new route to concentrate and remove amphiphilic molecules, such as PFAS, from source points, relevant to landfill leachates or surface waters. The study also points at gaps in materials science and surface engineering to be tackled to deal with PFAS compounds efficiently."

"An investigation of shippers’ satisfaction and behaviour towards corporate social responsibility in maritime transport Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy Anchoring on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), the current paper investigates the moderating influences of shippersâ€™ corporate social responsibility (CSR) beliefs on their satisfaction and behaviour towards shipping firmsâ€™ involvement in CSR. It also analyses organisational and environmental factors that shape shippersâ€™ CSR beliefs. Survey data were obtained from 276 shippers with business offices located in Singapore, and analysed using multi-sampling approach and linear regression modelling. The results show that shippers with strong CSR beliefs derive greater satisfaction, and exhibit stronger behavioural intentions towards shipping firmsâ€™ involvement in CSR. In addition, shippersâ€™ CSR beliefs are influenced by shippersâ€™ organisational characteristics such as (1) firm's age, (2) firm's size, (3) degree of internationalisation, (4) types of products shipped, and environmental factors such as (5) perceived environmental and social threats, (6) perceived level of competition, and (7) level of CSR practices in headquarters. The results contribute to TPB research application in both B2C and B2B contexts, and motivate changes to the current marketing and communication practices of shipping firms."
"Analyzing the Impact of Distribution of Battery Energy Storage System for Participation in Frequency Regulation Inertia; Asynchronous Generators; Wind Farms The transition to low carbon energy systems requires more Renewable Energy Sources (RES) into the electricity grid. However, the high penetration of RESs may cause a significant reduction in the power system inertial response, which may adversely affect the frequency regulation. Many studies utilized the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to participate in frequency regulation services, where most of the research were using a large-scale BESS in one location. This paper presents an analysis to investigate the impact of the distribution of the BESS throughout the network on frequency regulation performance. The frequency responses of twenty different BESS allocation scenarios and under two different RES penetration levels have been compared, with the same aggregated BESS capacity, which is 100 MVA - just the total capacity has been distributed throughout the network. The simplified 14 generator South-Eastern Australian power system has been simulated by using DigSILENT/PowerFactory software. The simulation results have shown that the distribution of the BESS in multiple locations have demonstrated better frequency nadir. However, the improvement in the Rate of Change of Frequency (ROCOF) were dependent on the BESS locations."

"Trace metals concentration in vegetables of a sub-urban industrial area of bangladesh and associated health risk assessment Soil; Cadmium; Average Daily Intake Trace metals contamination of vegetables in the sub-urban industrial area of Bangladsh are increasing day by day. The mostly consumed vegetables like tomato (Lycopersicon lycopersicum), spinach (Spinacea oleracea), bean (Lablab purpureus), brinjal (Solanum melongena), potato (Solanum tuberosum), cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var botrytis), cabbage (Brassica oleracea var cupitata), and radish (Raphanus sativus) were collected from industrial area. Trace metals arsenic (As), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The descending order of trace metals followed the order of Zn>Mn>Pb>Cd>As. The results revealed that every vegetable contained the highest concentration of Zn range from 15 Â± 1.4 to 50 Â± 4.0 mg/kg fresh weight. Trace metals in vegetables exceeded the permissible level of FAO and WHO standard. The non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were estimated on the basis of estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI) and target carcinogenic risks (TRs). The EDI values of all trace metals were below the maximum tolerable daily intake (MTDI). Total target hazard quotient (TTHQ) were greater than 1, indicated that if people consume these types of vegetables in their diet, they might pose risk to these metals. Finally, the total cancer risks (TRs) values were 6.4 Ã— 10âˆ’3 for As and 8.7 Ã— 10âˆ’5 for Pb which were greater than threshold value of USEPA (10âˆ’6), indicating that the consuming inhabitants of these vegetables are exposed to As and Pb with a lifetime cancer risk."

"Nonvolatile Multistates Memories for High-Density Data Storage Magnetism; Tunnel Junctions; MRAM Device In the current information age, the realization of memory devices with energy efficient design, high storage density, nonvolatility, fast access, and low cost is still a great challenge. As a promising technology to meet these stringent requirements, nonvolatile multistates memory (NMSM) has attracted lots of attention over the past years. Owing to the capability to store data in more than a single bit (0 or 1), the storage density is dramatically enhanced without scaling down the memory cell, making memory devices more efficient and less expensive. Multistates in a single cell also provide an unconventional in-memory computing platform beyond the Von Neumann architecture and enable neuromorphic computing with low power consumption. In this review, an in-depth perspective is presented on the recent progress and challenges on the device architectures, material innovation, working mechanisms of various types of NMSMs, including flash, magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), resistive random-access memory (RRAM), ferroelectric random-access memory (FeRAM), and phase-change memory (PCM). The intriguing properties and performance of these NMSMs, which are the key to realizing highly integrated memory hierarchy, are discussed and compared."
"Video with Impact: Access to the World's Magnetic-Resonance Experts for the Scientific-Education Community Animal Structures; Cadaver; Body Painting Magnetic resonance is a powerful technology that has had a major impact across the physical, life, and medical sciences, from chemistry to medical imaging, with ever-expanding applications in new areas as diverse as mining and food science. It is, however, also a difficult subject to teach, as the theory is complex and requires some familiarity with advanced mathematical concepts to fully comprehend. The first encounters of many students with magnetic resonance are often obscured by explanations that make the subject difficult to understand, lack sufficient detail on the underlying principles, and/or are devoid of real-world examples. This initial, frustrating exposure to the subject can result in disengagement and hinder future attempts to grasp key subject matter. Skilled educators with subject expertise are able to present complex material in an engaging and relevant way, but such people are not present in every institution. A solution to this problem is to use online recordings of globally recognized, engaging lecturers. Here, we report a new resource in the form of four high-quality, online lecture series produced by the Australian and New Zealand Society for Magnetic Resonance (ANZMAG), which are presented by some of the world's best teachers and practitioners of magnetic resonance. The target audience includes postgraduates, final-year undergraduates, university teachers, and researchers. The videos are free to access and are designed to teach and reinforce important concepts in magnetic resonance. To date, the four series, each covering a major topic in magnetic resonance and together totaling over 30 h of lectures, have been viewed over 200,000 times in 168 countries."

"Numerical and experimental evaluation of a Dual-Fuel Dry- Low-NOx micromix combustor for industrial gas turbine applications Combustion Chambers; Gas Turbines; Hydrogen The dry-low-NOx (DLN) micromix combustion technology has been developed originally as a low emission alternative for industrial gas turbine combustors fueled with hydrogen. Currently, the ongoing research process targets flexible fuel operation with hydrogen and syngas fuel. The nonpremixed combustion process features jet-in-crossflow-mixing of fuel and oxidizer and combustion through multiple miniaturized flames. The miniaturization of the flames leads to a significant reduction of NOx emissions due to the very short residence time of reactants in the flame. The paper presents the results of a numerical and experimental combustor test campaign. It is conducted as part of an integration study for a dual-fuel (H2 and H2/CO 90/10 vol %) micromix (MMX) combustion chamber prototype for application under full scale, pressurized gas turbine conditions in the auxiliary power unit Honeywell Garrett GTCP 36-300. In the presented experimental studies, the integration-optimized dual-fuel MMX combustor geometry is tested at atmospheric pressure over a range of gas turbine operating conditions with hydrogen and syngas fuel. The experimental investigations are supported by numerical combustion and flow simulations. For validation, the results of experimental exhaust gas analyses are applied. Despite the significantly differing fuel characteristics between pure hydrogen and hydrogen-rich syngas, the evaluated dual-fuel MMX prototype shows a significant low NOx performance and high combustion efficiency. The combustor features an increased energy density that benefits manufacturing complexity and costs."

"Internet of Things and autonomous control for vertical cultivation walls towards smart food growing: A review Green Roofs; Hot Temperature; Sedum Acre The development of green spaces in urban areas is rapidly on the rise as more people are keen to maintain a clean and green atmosphere around where they live and work. Also, the link between the physical world and the internet has been a driving force in enhancing people's quality of life which has resulted in the most recent and rising technologies, collectively referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). The adoption of vertical gardens (VG) and/or vertical farms (VF) can be beneficial for maintaining a sustainable environment, as well as for expanding food security in an urban context around the world with limited land space. IoT technologies have the potential to be key enablers in the accelerated adoption of VG. In this study, we investigate the critical parameters for automating sustainable vertical gardening systems by using the IoT concept in smart cities towards smart living. This involves collection and review of data from 30 peer-reviewed publications published between 2004 and 2018, including real-world VG implementations. The key criteria considered include: (i) crop/plant type, (ii) VG topology (size), (iii) sensing data, (iv) used hardware (sensors, actuators, etc.), (v) power supplies, (vi) velocity or frequency of data collection, (vii) data storage method, (viii) communication technologies, (ix) data analysis methods/algorithm, (x) other used strategies, and (xi) countries that implemented VGs. The data were subsequently analyzed to obtain a detailed understanding of using IoT in VGs. The results of the analysis revealed that most of the studies used 6-20 tiers (40%) when implementing VGs, and the most popular crop was lettuce (28.6%). The sensors used were commonly connected to AC power and battery (each 44.4%), while only a small proportion of VGs used solar power (11.1%). The majority of IoT sensors used were to measure room temperature (22.5%), light intensity (21.1%), humidity level (14%) and soil nutrition (7%). The frequency of data collection by these sensors was between 1 and 3 minutes (42.8%). The frequently used data transmission technology was Zigbee and Wi-Fi (42.8%) for collecting sensor data from VGs. We also found that, using the server database, remote data management platform and cloud were the most popular data storage methods (each 25%). After data collection, many studies used threshold-based algorithms (50%) for the decision making, and the soil-based (42%) and hydroponic (38%) were the most popular plant cultivation technologies. The use of recycled and reused water (30%), solar power (20%) and controlled indoor environment, without sun or soil (20%) are some of the other essential considerations in VGs. Furthermore, it was found that the most significant focus on automation of VGs incorporating IoT were in USA (41.2%) and China (23.5%). The impact of vertical cultivation walls on human well-being was discussed. In addition to this, eight international patents on VGs have been analyzed to acquire an implementation understanding of autonomous control or using IoT in vertical gardens."
"The pathophysiology and the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in prostate cancer Cannabinoids; Win 55212-2; Antineoplastic Activity Prostate cancer is the second most frequently occurring cancer diagnosed among males. Recent preclinical evidence implicates cannabinoids as powerful regulators of cell growth and differentiation. In this review, we focused on studies that demonstrated anticancer effects of cannabinoids and their possible mechanisms of action in prostate cancer. Besides the palliative effects of cannabinoids, research from the past two decades has demonstrated their promising potential as antitumor agents in a wide variety of cancers. This analysis may provide pharmacological insights into the selection of specific cannabinoids for the development of antitumor drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer."

"Bridging the Gap Between Industry and Academia: The Case of Indonesia Entrepreneurial University; Academic Entrepreneurship; Innovation As a country, Indonesia is becoming increasingly urbanized and has a large proportion of its population under the age of 25 years, at slightly over 100 million. Developing this fairly large proportion of its population from a human capital perspective is essential for the future of the country. Currently there is a 40% gap between supply and demand; and is expected to grow to 70% by 2025. Building an educational platform for effective learning and skills formation is urgently needed. This entry presents the outcomes of a case study aimed at understanding the disconnects between academia, industry and government in the context of Indonesiaâ€™s built environment programs. In particular, the architecture profession and architectural education have been considered as one of several built environment programs under pressure to change. Built environment suite of programs have various disciplinary underpinnings: architecture, building, engineering, planning, quantity surveying, project management and others such as interior design and transportation engineering. The case study focuses on the results of a workshop in Indonesia, where various stakeholders responsible for city planning and building came together to determine the current challenges and seek solutions. The entry delves into the education of the architecture profession in Indonesia and presents the results of the workshop with some recommendations for the future. The results show that the various sectors and stakeholders are prepared to work collaboratively and support joint ownership of meeting curricular outcomes."

"Neighbourhood ethnic diversity and mental health in Australia Subjective Well-Being; Happiness; Life Satisfaction We present the first study that empirically examines the effects of neighbourhood ethnic diversity on mental health. Using 16 waves of longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, we find that ethnic diversity is negatively associated with mental health. Our preferred estimates, using lagged ethnic diversity at the state level to instrument for neighbourhood ethnic diversity, suggest that a standard deviation increase in ethnic diversity is associated with a decline of 0.092â€“0.129 standard deviations in mental health. This result is robust to alternative estimation approaches to addressing endogeneity of ethnic diversity and alternative ways of measuring ethnic diversity and irrespective of whether mental health is measured with the Mental Health Inventory scale or the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). We further find that ethnic diversity influences mental health through the level of neighbourhood trust. Our findings point to the need to develop policies that promote social inclusion in multicultural societies and build trust between heterogeneous ethnic groups as a vehicle to improve mental health."

"The economic benefits of reductions in nitrogen loads from stormwater runoff by street trees Stemflow; Interception; Throughfall It is increasingly recognised that urban trees can contribute to reducing stormwater runoff by intercepting and retaining a fraction of rainfall received. What is less studied is the translation of this to reduced pollutant loads being transferred to receiving streams, rivers, and water bodies. In this paper, we assess interception of two tree species (Eucalyptus microcorys and Ulmus procera) in an urban park. These data are used in simple water balance modelling to predict the environmental and economic benefit of reducing nitrogen loads to receiving waterways as a function of reduced runoff volume resulting from rainfall interception by urban trees on public land (21% of the catchment area). We use a highly urbanized catchment in Melbourne, Australia to demonstrate the impact of an urban forest dominated by deciduous trees, evergreen trees or a mixed tree canopy cover. We found that doubling the urban canopy cover in the catchment, while keeping the current mix ratio of deciduous and evergreen trees, could reduce annual runoff volume by 30 mm (92 MLyrÌ„1). Using the prescribed values that developers must pay the local water authority for nitrogen treatment as a condition of new development, we calculate that this would deliver a nitrogen load removal benefit of AUD$ 200/tree. If only deciduous trees are planted, the annual runoff reduction would decrease to 24 mm (73 MLyrÌ„1) and increases to 37 mm (112 MLyrÌ„1) if only evergreen trees are planted. This study highlights both the additional benefits of public street trees and the differences in deciduous and evergreen trees which should be accounted for by policy makers."
"An Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search for asset protection during escaped wildfires Combinatorial Auctions; Vehicle Routing; Pickup and Delivery The asset protection problem is encountered where an uncontrollable fire is sweeping across a landscape comprising important infrastructure assets. Protective activities by teams of firefighters can reduce the risk of losing a particular asset. These activities must be performed during a time-window for each asset determined by the progression of the fire. The nature of some assets is such that they require the simultaneous presence of more than one fire vehicle and its capabilities must meet the requirements of each asset visited. The objective is then to maximise the value of the assets protected subject to constraints on the number and type of fire trucks available. The solution times to this problem using commercial solvers preclude their use for operational purposes. In this work we develop an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search algorithm (ALNS) based on problem-specific attributes. Several removal and insertion heuristics, including some new algorithms, are applied. A new benchmark set is generated by considering the problem attributes. In tests with small instances the ALNS is shown to achieve optimal, or near optimal, results in a fraction of the time required by CPLEX. In a second set of experiments comprising larger instances the ALNS was able to produce solutions in times suitable for operational purposes. These solutions mean that significantly more assets can be protected than would be the case otherwise."
"Insights into business strategies for reducing food waste in the Australian food industry Business Model Innovation; Innovation; Digital Transformation A significant amount of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted worldwide. To prevent and reduce food waste, the food industry needs a productive and profitable approach. Such approaches often entail businesses making decisions that utilise and integrate sustainability tools. Integrating tools into businesses can inform their sustainability strategies and activities. This sustainability-driven opportunity indicates a need to gain insights into business strategies for reducing food waste and the tools used to do so. The current study reviews these strategies and tools by examining publicly available Australian food industry documents. Based on an analysis of secondary sources, this review identified 40 food businesses and revealed their various strategies for reducing food waste. The review found that several businesses use various strategies to reduce food waste, including sustainable farming, diverting waste from landfills and donating unsold food. However, preventative strategies for surplus food creation have received less attention in addressing the causes of food waste. Interestingly, little published information on the tools contributing to more sustainable food production. The review's findings can provide practical implications and guidelines through a more nuanced understanding of food waste strategies. The conclusion also explains the study's limitations and suggests further research areas."
"Prediction of thermo-physical properties of 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate for CO2 capture using machine learning models Ionic Liquids; Thermodynamic Properties; Densimeters Physical and thermodynamic properties of physical or chemical solvents are of utmost importance for mass and heat transfer calculations, process design and solvent regeneration. In recent times, machine learning has attracted interest for applications in several fields of engineering sciences. The ionic liquid 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [Bmim][PF6] is an emerging solvent for CO2 capture. In this study, three Gaussian process regression (GPR) models - the Matern 5/2 GPR model, rational quadratic GPR model, squared exponential GPR model - and one support vector machine (SVM) model (the nonlinear SVM)â€“ are developed for predicting CO2 solubility, density, viscosity and molar heat capacity of [Bmim][PF6]. Detailed statistics of each model and comparative analyses between the models and their predicted results with experimental results is highlighted."

"Suitability Prediction and Enhancement of Future Water Supply Systems in Barwon Region in Victoria, Australia Environmental Assessment; Landscape Fragmentation; China Intensive agricultural production accompanied by the climate change impacts in postColonial rural landscapes have continuously increased the demand for water resources and coastal areas, showing an unprecedented water supply crisis. By taking extreme weather conditions and rainfall events for future trends, a resilient water storage facility for the landscape requires the collaborative approach of natural systems and simulation modelling techniques to develop sustainable future scenarios. In this study, an ecological suitability model is used to identify potential sites for the construction of multi-purpose dams. As part of the model structure, multi factors are classified using the patterns of changing landscapes, and then weighted overlay analysis is conducted on a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. Compared to previous studies, this paper derives its principal impact parameters and projections based on historical land cover information. The suitability maps that are generated visually guide the geographical location of the multi-purpose dams and indicate the areas from highly suitable to least suitable, clarifying the possibility of building blue infrastructure alongside the waterways in west-central Barwon. The workflow proposes a resilient water system based on existing land characteristics and measures that future water storage capacity will be a valid increase of approximately 1.5 times. This strategy alleviates water scarcity during the dry season to benefit traditional agricultural activities. Digital calculations are utilized to demonstrate the feasibility of the experimental results, providing a methodology for regulating the distribution and supply of river flows throughout the year while retaining runoff in a hierarchical pattern at precipitation periods."

"Processes and institutions for scientific independence: Reflections on land & water Australia Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Independent and impartial scientific research provides critical contributions to many contemporary policy debates, including those about climate adaptation and natural resources. Therefore, institutional arrangements that enable and protect scientific independence are central to resolving environ mental problems in advanced liberal democracies. This paper provides an overview of the research and development (R&D) funding organisation Land & Water Australia (LWA) that, due to its statutory independence, was effective and influential in promoting sustainable natural resource management. Established by legislation that provided structural independence, LWA was insulated from direct interference, enabling it to operate at armâ€™s length from executive government. The paper profiles LWA contributions to changing policies and practices, and explores the features that enabled LWA to co ordinate, organise and fund R&D, until its abolition in 2009. LWA provided a useful precedent of a statutory authority, chartered with a clear legislated purpose and legal mechanisms for ensuring independence. The paper highlights institutional arrangements that protect scientific independence, arguing that LWA provided an important model of public R&D investment directed to sustainability transformations."
"Fire resistance of 3D printed concrete composite wall panels exposed to various fire scenarios 3D Printers; Geopolymers; Concretes Purpose: Fire safety of a building is becoming a prominent consideration due to the recent fire accidents and the consequences in terms of loss of life and property damage. ISO 834 standard fire test regulation and simulation cannot be applied to assess the fire performance of 3D printed concrete (3DPC) walls as the real fire time-temperature curves could be more severe, compared to standard fire curve, in terms of the maximum temperature and the time to reach that maximum temperature. Therefore, this paper aims to describe an investigation on the fire performance of 3DPC composite wall panels subjected to different fire scenarios. Design/methodology/approach: The fire performance of 3DPC wall was traced through developing an appropriate heat transfer numerical model. The validity of the developed numerical model was confirmed by comparing the time-temperature profiles with available fire test results of 3DPC walls. A detailed parametric study of 140 numerical models were, subsequently, conducted covering different 3DPC wall configurations (i.e. solid, cavity and rockwool infilled cavity), five varying densities and consideration of four fire curves (i.e. standard, hydrocarbon fire, rapid and prolong). Findings: 3DPC walls and Rockwool infilled cavity walls showed superior fire performance. Furthermore, the study indicates that the thermal responses of 3DPC walls exposed to rapid-fire is crucial compared to other fire scenarios. Research limitations/implications: To investigate the thermal behaviour, ABAQUS allows performing uncoupled and coupled thermal analysis. Coupled analysis is typically used to investigate combined mechanical-thermal behaviour. Since, considered 3DPC wall configurations are non-load bearing, uncouple heat transfer analysis was performed. Time-temperature variations can be obtained to study the thermal response of 3DPC walls. Originality/value: At present, there is limited study to analyse the behaviour of 3DPC composite wall panels in real fire scenarios. Hence, this paper presents an investigation on the fire performance of 3DPC composite wall panels subjected to different fire scenarios. This research is the first attempt to extensively study the fire performance of non-load bearing 3DPC walls."

"The Australian carbon tax: corporate perceptions, responses and motivations Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: This study aims to explore how large Australian companies in emission intensive industries perceived the introduction of the Carbon Tax as an approach to carbon emissions regulation and as a tool for accountability. It also investigates the influence of perceptions of the new tax on the internal carbon emissions management practices and the motivations for such actions. Design/methodology/approach: This study draws on transaction cost theory and legitimacy theory to address corporate perceptions, responses and motivations in relation to the Carbon Tax. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 senior managers directly responsible for the carbon emissions management of their companies. Findings: The study found that the Carbon Tax, viewed by the high-emitting companies as a heavy financial burden, had a significant influence on moderating organisational legitimacy seeking behaviours. It is evident that the transaction cost issues in the form of the carbon pricing requirement has led to a change of focus to â€œmanagementâ€ rather than merely reporting to external stakeholders. This influenced companies to change their behaviour with the potential to internalise previous externalities of carbon pollution. Research limitations/implications: This research highlights that a pricing signal in emissions regulations is essential in conjunction with external pressures to effectively stimulate emissions management actions in companies. It extends our understanding of legitimacy theory by suggesting that a mandatory pricing mechanism as explained by transaction cost economics has the potential to lead to actual changes in corporate behaviour through a focus on management rather than reporting. Practical implications: The study highlights the important elements of any effective emissions policy designed to encourage strong emissions management actions from companies. Based on the findings of the study, it is evident that the Carbon Tax was a very effective mechanism in driving emission management actions, despite the general perception that any deficiencies associated with such a price mechanism could have a negative effect on the economy. Social implications: Climate change is a critical issue for the modern society and this study discussed a short-lived policy tool in the Australian context that had the potential to change corporate behaviour in relation to carbon management. Originality/value: This study is among the very few studies that have examined the influence of the Carbon Tax on internal emissions management practices of companies, and therefore, provides a unique dataset of corporate responses to the Carbon Tax. Given the short time frame that the Carbon Tax was in operation, the study enhances our understanding of the influence the Carbon Tax had on companies responsible for high greenhouse gas emissions."

"A comparison of four experiments in extending labour regulation to non-standard and informal workers Labor Regulation; Garment Industry; Cambodia Workers most exposed to economic risk around the world are commonly not covered by labour law either because laws were designed with people with a standard, continuous employer in mind or because of poor enforcement. According to the International Labour Organization's estimates, informal work, as a percentage of non-agricultural employment, continues to account for over 50% of all employment in half of the countries with comparable data across the globe. In onethird of countries, it involves over 65% of workers.1 There are exciting local and national experiments in new forms of labour regulation occurring in various countries that aim to extend labour regulation to non-standard workers, ensuring that they receive living minimum wages. This article compares four experiments in regulating work, including innovations in the regulation of work for head load (Mathadi) workers in India, immigrant industrial clothing outworkers in Australia, garment workers in Cambodia, and workers in Bulgaria who rely on a range of homebased activities to survive. The schemes have enjoyed varying success, providing lessons about what does and does not work in different contexts."

Taking Shenzhen Port as an example, cargo handled at the seaports of Shenzhen, gross domestic product of Shenzhen, and the number of employed persons of Shenzhen, respectively, were chosen to build the vector autoregressive VAR model and to analyze the two sets of variables based on the impulse response and variance decomposition. The study shows that the economic development of Shenzhen has obvious stage characteristics on the development of the port, that it produces certain negative benefits, that the interaction between the two is not obvious, and that the current development of Shenzhen Port is in urgent need of transformation and repositioning."
"Patterns of historical and future urban expansion in Nepal Sleuths; Cellular Automaton Model; Urbanization Globally, urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented rate at the cost of agricultural and forested lands in peri-urban areas fringing larger cities. Such land-cover change generally entails negative implications for societal and environmental sustainability, particularly in South Asia, where high demographic growth and poor land-use planning combine. Analyzing historical land-use change and predicting the future trends concerning urban expansion may support more effective land-use planning and sustainable outcomes. For Nepal's Tarai region-a populous area experiencing land-use change due to urbanization and other factors-we draw on Landsat satellite imagery to analyze historical land-use change focusing on urban expansion during 1989-2016 and predict urban expansion by 2026 and 2036 using artificial neural network (ANN) and Markov chain (MC) spatial models based on historical trends. Urban cover quadrupled since 1989, expanding by 256 km2 (460%), largely as small scattered settlements. This expansion was almost entirely at the expense of agricultural conversion (249 km2). After 2016, urban expansion is predicted to increase linearly by a further 199 km2 by 2026 and by another 165 km2 by 2036, almost all at the expense of agricultural cover. Such unplanned loss of prime agricultural lands in Nepal's fertile Tarai region is of serious concern for food-insecure countries like Nepal."

This survey evaluated the level of cybersecurity awareness and discernment amongst university students in Sri Lanka. The study was based on primary data collected through a questionnaire on awareness and the perception of cybersecurity from respondents at universities in Sri Lanka. The results indicated that experience and the level of cybersecurity awareness among university students in Sri Lanka are not significantly low, but there are some knowledge gaps with new threats. Further, the results showed that university students in Sri Lanka were able to identify cybercrime as a threat. These findings necessitate building awareness and developing capacity to improve studentâ€™s knowledge on the cybersecurity subject especially if universities are to be used as a key focal point in cybersecurity awareness campaigns in Sri Lanka."

"Precariously placed: housing affordability, quality and satisfaction of Australians with disabilities Social Support; Social Care; Direct Payments Access to adequate, safe, secure, accessible and affordable housing is a fundamental human right and one stipulated in the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Australian adults with disabilities experience housing disadvantage including homelessness, poor-quality housing and housing unaffordability; however, we lack a comprehensive comparison of the housing circumstances of people with and without disabilities and differences by impairment type. We analysed data from a nationally representative sample of 11,394 working-aged Australians collected in 2011. We found that people with disabilities experienced disadvantage across all housing indicators, and people with intellectual and psychological disabilities fared worst. These findings suggest that there is a housing crisis for Australians with disabilities, which may intensify with the introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There is a need to develop long-term housing solutions that promote independence, are accessible and affordable, and that consider location and neighbourhood context."

"How are gender inequality and violence against women related? Findings from a population-level community attitudes survey Child Care; Time Use; Domestic Division of Labour Low support for gender equality (GE) predicts attitudes supporting violence against women (VAW). However, little is known about the influence of attitudes toward different manifestations of GE. This study extends knowledge by assessing the relative strength of attitudes to GE across seven theoretically derived dimensions, and their association with attitudes toward VAW. 17,542 Australians participated in the 2017 National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women Survey. Population means were calculated for the following scales formed from survey questions: the Community Attitudes Supportive of Violence Against Women Scale (CASVAWS), the Gender Equality Attitudes Scale (GEAS) and measures within the GEAS representing the theoretical dimensions. There was variation in support for GE between the measures. The lower the support for GE, the higher the support for VAW. Although all GEAS measures included in regression modelling contributed to variance in the CASVAWS, two accounted for more than half. The study suggests benefits in using a multidimensional model of GE to mitigate cultural support for VAW, with emphasis on the private sphere and countering hostility toward women and rigid gender roles and identities."

"Exploring the prevalence and factors associated with self-reported traffic crashes among app-based motorcycle taxis in Vietnam Wounds And Injuries; Head Protective Devices; Road Traffic Motorcycle taxis play an important role in many developing countries, particularly in servicing areas where conventional public transport is not available. This form of transport has become more popular in recent years since online ride-hailing companies launched motorcycle taxi services. However, little is known about traffic crash risks among app-based motorcycle taxi riders. This study therefore aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with road traffic crashes among app-based motorcycle taxi riders. A field survey and online survey were undertaken to obtain information about ridersâ€™ socio-demographics, work patterns, travel behaviour and crash involvement. A total of 602 valid survey responses from riders were obtained across three cities in Vietnam, including 571 males and 31 females. The overall reported prevalence of road traffic crashes among app-based motorcycle taxi riders over a one-year period was 30%. Binary logistic regression modelling showed that traffic crashes were associated with non-students, low education levels, high daily travel distances, regular smoking, and using a mobile phone while driving. Despite regulation of online ride-hailing motorcycle taxi services in Vietnam, the reported prevalence of crashes among riders is considered to be relatively high. Targeted interventions to reduce the risk of being involved in a crash should be considered, such as increasing road safety education for non-student riders and imposing a daily travel distance limit for riders."
"Mental Health Impacts of Child Labour: Evidence from Vietnam and India Infant Health; War Exposure; Child Health A number of recent studies have investigated the relationship between child labour and physical health. However, there has been little empirical evidence that child labour affects childrenâ€™s emotional and behavioural development. This study departs from existing literature by examining the mental health impacts of child labour in Vietnam and India, as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The potential endogeneity of child labour is addressed by using rainfall as the instrument. The findings show that children engaged in child labour suffer from mental health issues as measured by peer problems and reduced prosocial behaviour in both countries. There is a significant gender difference in the impact of child labour in India. Finally, doing household chores, an accepted social and cultural work in developing countries is found to be associated with the better mental health of children in Vietnam."

"Cumulative Impacts of Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: Experimental Evidence from Indonesia Child Labor; Family Characteristic; School Attendance Conditional cash transfers provide income and promote human capital investments. Yet evaluating their longitudinal impacts is hard, as most experimental evaluations treat control locations after a few years. We examine such impacts in Indonesia after six years, where the program rollout left the experiment largely intact. We find static effects on many targeted indicators: childbirth using trained professionals increased dramatically, and under- 15 children not in school fell by half. We observe impacts requiring cumulative investments: stunting fell by 23 percent. While human capital accumulation increased, the transfers did not lead to transformative economic change for recipient households. (JEL I21, I38, J13, J24, O15)"

 Circular fruit waste project Organic waste, predominantly apple, pear and stone fruit is currently produced as a by-product of Montague Fresh production operations. These wastes are disposed of in landfill or as feed at a significant cost, currently Montague fresh dispose of approximately 500 tonnes of waste at a cost of around $50000 PA.
Production of valuable ingredients and/or products from this waste would be a desirable outcome in terms of environmental impact as well as a significant cost reduction. Waste reduction may be achieved via the development of ready to use powders and purees or development of healthy convenient snacks. Another promising avenue of utilising this type of waste is the extraction of valuable compounds and nutraceuticals such as pectin and soluble or insoluble fibre. Production of value-added products/ingredients along these lines adds further commercial benefit to the project."

"Blockchain anchoring of public registries: Options and challenges Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things Governments across the world are testing different uses of the blockchain for the delivery of their public services. Blockchain hashing-or the insertion of data in the blockchain (anchoring)-is one of the potential applications of the blockchain in this space. With this method, users can apply special scripts to add their data to blockchain transactions, ensuring both immutability and publicity. Blockchain hashing also secures the integrity of the original data stored on central governmental databases. The objective of this paper is to analyse the use of data hashing (anchoring) on the blockchain for public state-owned registries. This paper starts by analysing possible scenarios of hashing on the blockchain and assesses in which cases it may work and in which it is less likely to add value to a public administration. Second, the paper also compares this method with traditional digital signatures using PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and discusses standardisation in each domain. Third, it also addresses issues related with concepts such as â€œdistributed ledger technologyâ€ and â€œpermissioned blockchains.â€ Finally, it raises the question of whether blockchain hashing is an effective solution for electronic governance, and concludes that its value is controversial, even if it is improved by PKI and other security measures. In this regard, we claim that governments need to identify pain points in governance in the first place, and then consider the trade-offs of the blockchain as a potential solution versus other alternatives."

"Leveraging joint distribution in urban express delivery to lessen environmental impacts: a case study Freight Transport; City Logistics; Cargo Purpose: This paper aims to explore the use of joint distribution to reduce environmental cost of express delivery in urban logistics. Design/methodology/approach: An optimization model was developed to help design the joint distribution network. A real case in Songjiang University Town of Shanghai, China, was used to explore empirically the potential benefit of the design. Performance of the proposed joint distribution was compared with that of the current distribution design using separate deliveries. Findings: The findings show that, using joint distribution in express delivery, a significant saving in economic cost (up to a reduction of 25%) and environmental cost (up to a reduction of 87%) can be achieved. Research limitations/implications: This study provides a reference for joint distribution network design for last-mile delivery in urban logistics. Practical implications: Express delivery companies can explore the use of joint distribution to reduce operating cost and increase distribution efficiency of the industry. Social implications: Joint distribution can facilitate maximization of vehicle utilization and reduction of delivery trips. This will help reduce fuel consumption, carbon emission, as well as other externalities, such as noise and traffic congestion. Originality/value: Research in joint distribution to date focuses mainly on reduction in operating cost only. Consideration of environmental impact is relatively limited. This paper fills the gap in the literature by using a real case to illustrate the significant benefit of joint distribution in reducing the negative impact of urban logistics on the environment."

"Precise and compact movement sensors to support the industry 4.0 movement Precise and rapid autonomous movement is crucial for emerging applications ranging from self-driving cars and robotics, to
surgery and other initiatives in the industry 4.0 movement. However, such autonomous movement will require inertial
movement sensors to provide fast and accurate sensing and feedback on the speed and acceleration and enable calculation
of trajectory and position in real time. Inertial movement sensors are used in mass manufactured consumer electronics, such
as mobile phones, but these do not have the accuracy required for future industry 4.0 applications. Higher precision sensors
exist, but they are bulky and expensive and are hence limited mainly to military applications. Realising the vision of industry
4.0 depends on the emergence of sensors that have military precision, but at the cost, size and scale of consumer electronics."
"A two-stage method using biogeography-based optimization for simultaneous network reconfiguration and renewable energy integration Distribution Network; Reconfiguration; Distributed Generation Renewable Energy Resources (RERs) are a promising source of energy with hardly any pollution. Due to the intermittent nature from the output power of the nondispatchable RER and the load variations in the distribution network, it is important to frequently perform Network Reconfiguration (NR) to minimize the power loss and improve the network's voltage profile. Finding the optimal NR while simultaneously considering the dispatchable RER integration is important but challenging because of the complex combinational nature of the problem, and therefore, it is commonly solved by meta-heuristic techniques. However, the conventional meta-heuristic techniques involve random initializations and normally generate many nonfeasible solutions, which obstruct the search process. With the aim of improving the accuracy and consistency of the solution, this study proposes a two-stage method using biogeography-based optimization to attain the NR simultaneously with the RER placement and sizing for the sake of minimizing power loss and voltage deviation. The first stage simplifies the distribution network and then utilizes the simplified form to provide a better set of initial solutions and to maintain the network radiality. Thereafter, the second stage finds the final NR and RER locations and sizes. The simulations are carried out on 33-bus, 69-bus, and 118-bus systems, and the results are compared with previously published methods and some well-known optimization methods. In addition, load variations and RER's uncertainty are also considered. The obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods. The results also indicate the significance of the hourly NR in reducing power loss."

"Language Revitalisation: Building connections / storytelling a future Our proposal is centred on building capacity in collaboration with Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, educators and practitioners, a focus that needs much support at RMIT. This is achieved through a 3-part workshop series with teams of successful Indigenous/non-Indigenous collaborators, to learn from their open, collaborative frameworks and cross-disciplinary interaction, to generate opportunities for educational development, especially for non-Indigenous staff. The workshops build towards a 2-day symposium at RMIT, focused on shared storytelling and language, as an exemplar of successful Indigenous/non-Indigenous collaboration. We will document these examples and frameworks to become sharable resources through the RMIT website."
"Decoupling anthropogenic vs. natural impacts at a wastewater treatment plant situated on acid sulfate soils Acid Sulfate Soil; Wetlands; Acid Volatile Sulfides Decoupling natural and anthropogenic impacts on the subsurface environment can be difficult, particularly when it has been subject to a wide range of influences over time and space. In this work we show how the use of hydrogeochemical plotting tools, time-series analysis of key contaminants of concern, and targeted isotopic analysis can be used to better understand the contamination sources/processes in a complex environment â€“ a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) located on coastal acid sulfate soils (ASS). Analysis of soil profiles for potential oxidisable sulfur, acid neutralising capacity (ANC), and pHfox along with groundwater chemistry, revealed that oxidation of pyritic sediments, initially deposited during the mid-Holocene, have led to significant pH declines and the secondary mobilisation of metals into the groundwater environment. This is further complicated by historic anthropogenic inputs associated with the WWTP (e.g., effluent leakages) and the surrounding agricultural land uses. There is distinct separation between spatial and temporal trends in the nutrient and heavy metals data in groundwater, suggesting these reflect different contaminant sources and/or processes. Isotopic data indicate nutrients are largely derived from the WWTP, whereas time-series analysis of key contaminants of concern and hydrogeochemical plotting tools indicate metals are largely derived from the secondary mobilisation of ASS due to acidity generated during sulfide oxidation. This work highlights the importance of understanding the hydrogeological environment and need for careful planning and ongoing management of WWTP sites, particularly those constructed on potential acid sulfate soils (PASS), which, if disturbed or exposed, can lead to impacts beyond the area of ASS via groundwater discharge to nearby surface water bodies (in this case the site is adjacent to a Ramsar-listed wetland). The outcomes of this work have significant global application in the identification, assessment, and control of ASS, the practice of contaminant source attribution, and the siting and design of future WWTPs, which will continue to be sited in coastal areas to meet population needs."
"A machine learning based solution for space situational awareness and
 space sustainability: RP2: Advanced Satellite Systems, Sensors and Intelligence Z (PhD Candidate: Sai Krishna Reddy Vallapureddy) Space Situational Awareness (SSA) has not always been an integral part of space operation. It has now become the need of the hour for space sustainability after several satellite collisions and anti-satellite tests creating a lot of debris which is often referred to as “Space
Junk”. This Space Junk comes in various forms, shapes, and sizes. It can be either natural or manmade. Natural space debris consists of small pieces of cometary and asteroidal material called meteoroids. We see this natural debris as meteors when they travel through
the Earth's atmosphere. Artificial space debris is any non-functional man-made object in space (usually orbiting the Earth). There has been an estimated, upward of 500 breakups, explosions, collisions, or anomalous events resulting in fragmentation in the near-
Earth orbit. As of February 2020, the number of debris objects regularly tracked by Space Surveillance Networks and maintained in their catalogue is about 22,300. There are over 34,000 debris >10cm particles estimated by statistical models to be in orbit. There are over 900,000 debris objects between the range of 1 cm - 10 cm and a whopping 128 million debris objects between the range of 1 mm - 1 cm and exponentially more particles lower than 1mm.
Currently, SSA highly depends on ground-based capabilities limiting the accuracy of tracking objects to 10cm. This project will explore possible technological demonstration that utilizes International Space Station/ CubeSat payload for SSA alongside its efficiency and need for long-term space sustainability. The capability shall be achieved through machine learning as a part of the onboard computer.
The primary output will be a PhD thesis."

"Respect@Uni: A feminist insider perspective on respect-based culture change in higher education Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science This article provides feminist insider perspectives on the development and delivery of an innovative respect-based sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH) prevention initiative in higher education. The initiative is designed specifically to address risk factors in graduate research. It is one of the first of its kind world-wide. Respect and cognate, moderate feminist, concepts are increasingly prevalent as oblique, or stealth, approaches to gender equality in contexts in which doing so openly may be counterproductive. The respect-based initiative examined here addresses the various risk factors that distinguish graduate research from undergraduate education, particularly power imbalances. Adopting a feminist reflective practice methodology, we provide an insider perspective into the multi-layered processes involved in enabling and undertaking institution-wide culture change of this kind. Our critical reflections focus on the stealth approaches adopted during design and delivery, highlighting resistance and receptivity to the initiative and how these were either countered or harnessed. The article provides both practical and theoretical insights into the advantages and limitations of respect-based culture-change. Most notably, it contributes to enhanced understanding of what works in practice, for which there is an urgent need."

"Firm resources and the development of environmental sustainability among small and medium‐sized enterprises: Evidence from the australian wine industry Sustainability; Environmental Management Systems; Eco-Management and Audit Scheme Scholars and industry professionals want clarification of the specific firm resources that influence the adoption and development of environmentally sustainable strategies. This paper, set in the context of the Australian wine industry, explores different firm resources that are beneficial for environmentally sustainable development and examines the role of management attitudes and norms in moderating this relationship. It establishes which resources small and mediumâ€sized enterprises (SMEs) should invest in to be more successful in following environmental principles. The findings of a survey of the ownerâ€managers of Australian wineâ€producing SMEs are reported, and partial least squares structural equation modelling is utilized to analyze the data. Results clearly indicate that successful firms that manage their resources more effectively influence the application of environmental behaviour, with one distinct resource significantly influencing the disclosure of such behaviour. A moderating effect is established which supports the notion that proâ€environmental decisionâ€making in SMEs is heavily influenced by the attitudes and norms held by management."

"Is concrete healing really efficient? A review Self-Healing; Super Absorbent Polymers; Crack Concrete is a widely used material in the construction industry due to its affordability and availability; however, it is also sensitive to crack formation typically under tension stresses. Due to cracking, the durability of concrete is compromised via contaminant ingress such as rapid chloride penetration and atmospheric water that infiltrate through these cracks and potentially lead to corrosion of steel in reinforced concrete. Self-healing materials embedded in cementitious materials is emerging as an innovative method to improve concrete durability. This paper reviews available self-healing approaches considering various healing materials with respect to performance and application. Attention to the efficiency of healing materials including biotechnological, polymeric and chemical components for crack healing and improvement in strength is a major focus. Consideration is also placed on methods of testing, evaluation methods for calculating efficiency and comparison of self-healing materials and their efficiency. Finally, a conceptual life-cycle cost for conventional and self-healing concrete structures is provided."

"What is the meaning of urban liveability for a city in a low-to-middle-income country? Contextualising liveability for Bangkok, Thailand Public Space; Molinate; Urban Design Background: Creating 'liveable' cities has become a priority for various sectors, including those tasked with improving population health and reducing inequities. Two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities by 2050, with the most rapid urbanisation in low- A nd middle-income countries (LMIC). However, there is limited guidance about what constitutes a liveable city from a LMIC perspective, with most of the evidence relating to high-income countries, such as Australia. Existing liveability frameworks include features such as public transport, affordable housing, and public open space; however, these frameworks may not capture all of the liveability considerations for cities in LMIC contexts. Objectives: This case study formed a multi-sectoral partnership between academics, policymakers (Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, Victorian (Australia) Department of Health and Human Services), and a non-government organisation (UN Global Compact-Cities Programme). This study aimed to: 1) conceptualise and prioritise components of urban liveability within the Bangkok, Thailand context; 2) identify alignment to or divergence from other existing liveability tools; and 3) identify potential indicators and data sources for use within a Pilot Bangkok Liveability Framework. Methods: The Urban Liveability Workshop involving technical leaders from the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration and a rapid review of liveability literature informed the conceptualisation of liveability for Bangkok. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Working Group and key informants in Bangkok provided input into the liveability framework. Indicators identified for Bangkok were mapped onto existing liveability tools, including the UN Global Compact CityScan. Results: Findings revealed commonalities with the Australian liveability definition, as well as new potential indicators for Bangkok. The resulting Pilot Bangkok Liveability Framework provides a structure for measuring liveability in Bangkok that can be implemented by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration immediately, pending appropriate data acquisition and licensing. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Working Group and key informants identified core issues for implementation, including limited spatial data available at the district-level or lower. Conclusions: This study conceptualised urban liveability for Bangkok, a city in a LMIC context, with potential for adjustment to other cities. Future work should leverage opportunities for using open source data, building local capacity in spatial data expertise, and knowledge sharing between cities."
"The effect of airline passenger anthropometry on aircraft emergency evacuations Pedestrian; Evacuation; Crowds This paper demonstrates the impact of passenger anthropometry on the emergency egress for both single aisle and double aisle aircraft. A demographic model of passenger anthropometry based on Body Mass Index (BMI) categories was developed building upon data retrieved from an online database. Knowing that the prevalence of obesity is becoming greater at a global scale, various obesity condition were simulated to explore the effects of an increased number of obese/overweight passenger on-board medium and large aircrafts. Verification of the software used in egress simulations was carried out by undertaking a trial mimicking a real-life evacuation. The simulated results show that for current levels of BMI prevalence the time to evacuate an aircraft is 76.6 s (95% CI, 76.2â€“76.9) for a narrow-body and 87.1 s (95% CI, 86.7â€“87.7) for a wide-body aircraft. Leaving current prevalence of BMI categories unchanged but increasing overall obesity by just 5% can lead to an increase of the egress time of approximately 2 s for the wide-body aircraft scenario. The egress time is significantly increased when greater percentages of obese passengers are considered. The results show that the egress time for a population with a demographic distribution similar to that expected in the next 30 years exceeds the current time limit of 90 s considered by aviation authorities for certification purposes of passenger aircraft."

"Rapid translation of forensic data from police drug seizures into clinical alerts to improve
public health Illegal drug markets lack the quality control features of regulated product markets. For example, new psychoactive drugs often emerge and existing drug types frequently change strength or form. Optimal clinical responses to acute drug-related events should be tailored based on emerging information about these changing markets [1, 2].
Victoria Police Forensic Services are already resourced to locally monitor changes in drug markets through forensic analysis of all police seizures across the full spectrum of illegal drugs. These data are currently regularly shared within police networks and with researchers (e.g. lagged time-trend analysis [3]). However, they have not yet been shared rapidly with clinicians.
In order to maximise public-health value from Victoria Police Forensic Drug Intelligence Capability program, we will co-design, implement and evaluate the impact of rapid forensic intelligence alerts on clinical practice among frontline AOD workers and clinical resource managers."

"Informal Networks, Informal Institutions, and Social Exclusion in the Workplace: Insights from Subsidiaries of Multinational Corporations in Korea Guanxi; China; Managerial Ties Drawing on interviews with decision makers in multinational corporations (MNCs) in South Korea, we examine the role of informal networks in the social exclusion of women in the workforce. Although legislation in the country is in favor of gender equality, we found that informal barriers in the workplace remain difficult to overcome. Informal networks in Korea, yongo, present an ethical issue in the workplace, as they tend to socially exclude women, limiting possibilities for their participation and career progression. We found that informal networks are pervasive and strong because of the informal institutions in which they are embedded and that there is a complex interplay between informal networks and informal institutions that socially excludes women. Due to difficulties accessing yongo, women appear to build inmaek, a network type that is more open and accessible. We also found that MNCs in Korea can compensate for the lack of local informal networks for their female employees. However, despite providing a more supportive environment for women at work, gender equality policies in MNCs are not yet as effective as they could be due to the dynamics of the workplace and the fact that the policies are not tailored to the local context. We have seen evidence in recent years that MNCs can serve as role models for implementing gender equality policies by creating a more inclusive work environment and demonstrating leadership commitment and support."
"Selective Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Lignin to Alkyl Guaiacols Over NiMo/Al-MCM-41 Bio-Oil; Catalyst; Guaiacol Efficient deoxygenation of lignin-derived bio-oils is central to their adoption as precursors to sustainable liquid fuels in place of current fossil resources. In-situ catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH), using isopropanol and formic acid as solvent and in-situ hydrogen sources, was demonstrated over metal-doped and promoted MCM-41 for the depolymerization of oxygen-rich (35.85 wt%) lignin from Chinese fir sawdust (termed O-lignin). A NiMo/Al-MCM-41 catalyst conferred an optimal lignin-derived oil yield of 61.6 wt% with a comparatively low molecular weight (Mw=542 g molâˆ’1, Mn=290 g molâˆ’1) and H/C ratio of 1.39. High selectivity to alkyl guaiacols was attributed to efficient in-situ hydrogen transfer from isopropanol/formic acid donors, and a synergy between surface acid sites in the Al-doped MCM-41 support and reducible Ni/Mo species, which improved the chemical stability and quality of the resulting lignin-derived bio-oils."

"Engaging with artificial intelligence (AI) with a bottom-up approach for the purpose of sustainability: Victorian farmers market association, Melbourne Australia Machine Ethics; Artificial Intelligence; Roboethics Artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting all aspects of food systems, including production, food processing, distribution, and consumption. AI, if implemented ethically for sustainability, can enhance biodiversity, conserve water and energy resources, provide land-related services, power smart cities, and help mitigate climate change. However, there are significant issues in using AI to transition to sustainable food systems. AIâ€™s own carbon footprint could cancel out any sustainability benefits that it creates. Additionally, the technology could further entrench inequalities between and within countries, and bias against minorities or less powerful groups. This paper draws on findings from a study of the Victorian Farmersâ€™ Markets Association (VFMA) that investigated the complexity of designing AI tools to enhance sustainability and resilience for the benefit of the organisation and its members. Codesign workshops, both synchronous and asynchronous, semi-structured interviews, and design innovation methods led the VFMA to experiment with an AI tool to link sustainable soil practices, nutrient rich produce, and human health. The analysis shows that the codesign process and an agile approach created a co-learning environment where sustainability and ethical questions could be considered iteratively within transdisciplinary engagement. The bottom-up approach developed through this study supports organisations who want to engage with AI while reinforcing fairness, transparency, and sustainability."

"Is there a ‘Venice Effect’? Participation in the Venice Biennale and the implications for artists’ careers Art Market; Auction Houses; Art Prestige is widely considered to positively influence the careers of artists, and the Venice Biennale is arguably the most prestigious event in the international visual arts calendar. This article examines the impact that appearing in the Venice Biennale has on artistsâ€™ careers. With a sample of 98 artists from six countries who participated in the Biennale in the 20 years between 1997 and 2017, we used data relating to artistsâ€™ exhibition activity over a 10 year window split equally prior to and after their appearance at Venice to test how appearance at the Biennale impacts on total exhibition activity, as well as on their solo and international exhibition activity. The article examines whether a positive â€˜Venice effectâ€™ can be identified in participating artistsâ€™ career development by comparing changes in exhibition activity. We test whether gender, career stage and representing a peripheral art country (as opposed to a core art country) has an impact on artistsâ€™ post-Venice Biennale exhibition activity level. The article finds no evidence to support the existence of a universal â€˜Venice effectâ€™ in the number of exhibitions that artists appear in after their appearance. However, two findings do suggest a limited positive impact. Firstly, more established artists appear in a greater proportion of international and solo exhibitions after their appearance at the Biennale, suggesting that the quality of exhibition opportunities increases as a result of their exposure at Venice. Secondly, one country â€“ South Korea â€“ experiences an increase in the volume of exhibition opportunity after their appearance at Venice. This increase is apparent across male and female artists, and at all career stages. The article argues that the influence of Biennale appearance on an artist's career depends on the approach taken to selection by the country they represent, as well as the approach taken to the Biennale opportunity by each cohort and individual artist."
"Recycling Perspectives of Circular Business Models: A Review Industrial Symbiosis; Sustainable Development; Circular Economy The circular business model (CBM) is one of the main building blocks of circular economy (CE), and recycling is one of the main strategies for achieving it. CBM literature is currently evolving, and recycling-oriented discussion has been found in a scattered manner. This review article aims to identify critical components of the recycling-focused business model in CE and evaluate potential business and research opportunities in the area. Data collection was undertaken from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection and ScienceDirect database. Results of the study showed that efficiency of municipal solid waste management, reporting mechanism of recyclers cost of recycled materials, the establishment of a plastic hub, implementation of extended producer responsibility, strategic partnership, incentives, and product design were highlighted as critical requirements for efficient recycling operated business models, especially for waste solar PV panels, e-waste, textile waste, and vehicles and battery sector. It also identified the benefits of using recycled materials in reducing carbon footprint, energy consumption, and achieving low environmental impact. Three-dimensional printing, sensor-based RFID tags, digital twins, additive manufacturing, Industry 4.0, and the Internet of Things (IoT) were found as state-of-the-art technological innovations applied to recycling-oriented circular business models. This article provides critical practical solutions for new business model development and indicates vital future research directions along with a conceptual framework development, which would be helpful for policymakers, business entities, and research academics."

"Reliability-based service life prediction of corrosion-affected cast iron pipes considering multifailure modes Sewers; Water Supply; Cast Iron Pipe Cast iron pipes were widely used in water distribution networks before the 1960s and the majority of them have become aged and deteriorated with corrosion, which has been identified as one of the most common mechanisms of pipe failures. To have an optimum strategy for repair and/or replacement in the management of pipe assets, accurate prediction of the service life of the pipes is essential. This paper attempts to propose a method for reliability analysis and service life prediction for corrosion-affected pipes. Both loss of strength and fracture toughness of the pipe are considered in assessing pipe failures using a system reliability method. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out to identify those factors that affect the pipe behavior and failure the most. It is found in the paper that the probability of pipe failure is considerably greater when multifailure modes are considered as a system than when each failure mode is considered individually. It is also found that the likelihood of pipe failure due to loss of toughness is more than three times higher than that due to loss of strength. The paper concludes that multifailure modes should be considered in predicting pipe service life using a system reliability method as proposed here. The proposed method can improve the ability of the water industry in predicting and preventing catastrophic failures of the water pipes."
"How do banks price liquidity? The role of market power. Interest Margin; Bank Profitability; Banking We empirically examine the effects of different measures of liquidity on interest margins of a sample of U.S. commercial banks from 2001 to 2018. Overall, the results reveal that liquidity ratios exert a positive influence on bank margins. Furthermore, the study investigates the role of market power in the relationship between liquidity and interest margins. It is documented that dominant banks incorporate the costs associated with investing in liquidity into the bank margins to a lesser extent than banks with less market power, suggesting that the cost of complying with regulatory liquidity standards is reduced when the competition in the banking sector is less intense. The study highlights that market competition might be important in the design and implementation of liquidity regulations."

"Anaerobic co-digestion of sewage sludge with cellulose, protein, and lipids: Role of rheology and digestibility Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production Rheology is known to have an impact on the performance of digesters, but the effect of additional substrates (co-digestion) is poorly understood. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the addition of cellulose, protein and lipids to substrates on the rheological behaviour and biogas production of the mixture of primary sludge (PS) and waste-activated sludge (WAS) in a batch system. A mixture of PS and WAS to form the main substrate was anaerobically co-digested with different types of organic matter (cellulose, protein and lipids) as co-substrates at different co-substrate to main substrate ratios of 2â€“8 (wt%) under mesophilic conditions and below ammonia inhibition levels. Yield stress (Ï„y) and the flow consistency index (k) of the combined feed in the case of cellulose and protein were significantly dependent on the amount of co-substrate added, while there was an insignificant impact on these properties when lipids were added. Cellulose significantly increased Ï„y and k in the feed, which resulted in poor fluidity and the improper homogenisation of the digester content, and consequently decreased the biogas yield. In contrast, the biogas yield was improved through the addition of 2% to 6% protein despite an increase in Ï„y and k of the feed, but the methane yield decreased at 7% and 8% levels of protein concentration. This observation indicates that the threshold for Ï„y and k of the digester media depends on the organic nature and digestibility of the substrate. There was no significant impact on the flow properties of the initial mixture when lipids were added, and their addition increased the biogas yield. A first-order kinetic reaction model was used for predicting the yield of methane from these digesters. The rate constant values revealed an increasing trend, with the highest for protein then lipids then cellulose."

"The relationship between sustainable development practices and financial performance: A case study of textile firms in Vietnam Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy Sustainable development practices have become very important for firms to go beyond short-term profitability, towards economic, environmental and social sustainability. This research aims to examine the relationship between a firm's sustainable development practices and its financial performance. Modelled as a multidimensional construct, sustainable development practices are represented by environmental practices, social practices in the workplace and social practices in the community, while financial performance is determined by profitability and growth. Using a mixed method survey, data were obtained from 389 textile firms in Vietnam, where there is a dire need to promote sustainable and environmental practices. Data analysis using partial least squares structural equation modeling demonstrates that sustainable development practices positively affect financial performance directly and indirectly via customer loyalty, employee satisfaction and corporate reputation. The findings also reveal the moderating role of entrepreneurial orientation, whereby the impact of sustainable development practices on financial performance is stronger for firms that are more innovative, proactive and willing to take risks. Taken together, these findings provide support for firms to holistically implement sustainable development practices and adopt an entrepreneurial orientation."

"Scenarios of energy reduction potential of zero energy building promotion in the Asia-Pacific region to year 2050 Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation Building energy consumption in the Asia-Pacific region continues to rise. It is important to understand the energy use and future trends of 21 members of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and to find more effective ways to achieve APEC's dual goals of reducing energy intensity by 45% of 2005 levels by 2035 and doubling the share of renewable energy in the energy mix between 2010 and 2030. Recently, promoting building toward ultra-low energy, nearly zero energy and zero energy is becoming a consensus trend. This paper aims to explore how zero energy building promotion could influence the total energy demand in the mid to long term. An EUPP (Economic, Urbanization, Population and Purchasing power parity) model was established to show the relationship between building energy consumption and its influencing factors, and the potential development path of building energy consumption in APEC was predicted by using the model. The results show that in the Business As Usual (BAU) model, building energy demand will increase from 1387.4 Mtoe in 2016 to 2456.8 Mtoe in 2050 while in the CAP model, building energy demand will be constrained to under 2000 Mtoe before 2050. In the ZEB promotion model, 897.8 to 1945.3 Mtoe could be saved separately. The share of end demand supplied by onsite renewable energy production could reach 11%â€“54%. The building sector has the potential to become the largest contributor to achieve the APEC energy goal and thus to the climate change goal."

"Internalizing animals and ecosystems in social citizenship and social policy: From political community to political country Environmental Justice; Injustice; Air Quality The aim of this editorial is to explore, conceptualize, and research the need to internalize both animals and ecosystems in our understanding of social citizenship and social policy. This editorial should be seen as a brief overview of the themes that should be covered in the contributions to the Special Issue, â€œInternalizing Animals and Ecosystems in Social Citizenship and Social Policy: From Political Community to Political Countryâ€. This Special Issue argues the importance of integrating animals and ecosystems as a way to reâ€politicize humansâ€™ social relation with both animals and our ecosystem as in sustainable development and social policy. If environmental policy becomes social policy, we would reâ€construct social citizenship to include consideration for animals and ecosystems as integral part of social policy. This expansion in scope is a progression from seeing humans as part of a political community to becoming more involved in their political country. This aligns with the concept of Countryâ€”an allâ€encompassing term in Australia, involving a peopleâ€™s territory, land, water, biological resources, the complex obligations and relationships involved."

"Decent work for sustainable development in post-crisis Nepal: Social policy challenges and a way forward Welfare Regimes; Public Policy; Nepal Although the Decent Work agenda has received significant attention in the context of sustainable development, the formulation and implementation of appropriate social policies in developing countries remain an underexplored subject. This article responds to this gap and traces country-specific Decent Work related policies and programs in Nepalâ€”which is recovering from two major crises: a decade-long armed conflict that ended in 2006 as well as the 2015 earthquake. Drawing on Critical Policy Analysis framework, this article examines how key tenets of the International Labour Organisation's Decent Work platform, namely creation and provision of employment, social protection, social dialogue and rights at work have manifested in Nepal. The findings indicate that while attempts have been made to embrace the Decent Work agenda into social policies and programs, structural instability of political processes means that there is a lack of strategic directions to address a capacity deficit specific to the informal sector and outbound labour migrants. The article makes broader analytical contributions towards evaluating the implementation of social policies driven by the global priority in the context of developing nations with weak governance settings. In countries like Nepal, where the majority of workers are located within the informal sector and as such the administrative reach and effectiveness of Decent Work related social policies designed for the formal sector are limited."

"Political connections and post-disaster assistance in rural Vietnam Vietnam; Wildcat Strike; Urbanization Political connections have been shown to lead to corruption, favouritism and the pursuit of self-interests. They can therefore serve as an impediment to development and poverty reduction. This study examines whether having political connections is associated with post-disaster support from government authorities in the case of Vietnam. Using commune level data for the period 2012 to 2014 and a number of alternative econometric specifications, it finds that communes with higher levels of connections at the district level have a higher probability of receiving support in a post-shock period. The type of political connections is found to be important. We find a strong impact of political connections when household members are officials themselves or when households have relatives as officials. Having friends as officials does not appear to impact the likelihood of receiving assistance. The impacts are also greater when households have siblings, offspring or cousins working in government, but no evidence is found when officials are parents. Finally, having connections with district leaders is more important than connections with district officials."

"Carbene ligand-doped fe2 o3 composite for rapid removal of multiple dyes under sunlight Carbenes; Heterocyclics; Complex Contaminated water due to industrial organic dyes presents a significant challenge to sustainability. As a material of green energy, photocatalysts offer an effective and environmentally friendly way to deal with organic dyes for water treatment. A series of simple and highly efficient iron photocatalysts with carbene ligands were developed, which, under the illumination of sunlight, can rapidly degrade multiple organic dyes in water at room temperature, including rhodamine B (RhB), indigo carmine (IC), methyl blue (MB), and congo red (CR). The field-only surface integral method was carried out to determine the absorption spectrum of photocatalyst particles. Under the optimized experimental conditions which were selected by the orthogonal experiments for four dyes, 0.5a@Fe2 O3 and 2c@Fe2 O3 demonstrated good stability and photocatalytic activity. These two composite materials not only have the ability to remove 98.0% of the degradation in 10 s, but also maintain high reactivity after a few cycles of repeated use."

"Communicating Health and Safety on a Multinational Construction Project: Challenges and Strategies Personnel; Career Barriers; Employed Women The health and safety (H&S) of workers is a critical project management goal in construction. As globalization and migrant movement increases, construction projects are becoming more nationally diverse. Among multinational workforces, language barriers present an obvious but largely unresolved H&S communication challenge, with current strategies in use yet to be assessed. On a large construction project in the United Kingdom, H&S communication strategies were explored through an ethnographic approach. This paper contributes by revealing the impracticalities of using employees as interpreters in workgroups of six or more and the limitations of technologies in a dynamic construction site environment. It also highlights the unresolved challenge of translating safety videos in multiple languages. Challenges arose including translators refusing to translate because they were not receiving extra financial benefits or recognition in their workload. Translators were also given favorable treatment during disciplinary processes because they were crucial to the continued operation of the site team. This reveals the complexities involved in implementing effective H&S communication strategies on international and multinational projects, which have previously remained largely ignored."

"Improving Evolutionary Multitasking Optimization by Leveraging Inter-Task Gene Similarity and Mirror Transformation Knowledge Transfer; Runtime Analysis; Job Shop Scheduling Problem Solving a complex optimization task from scratch can be significantly expensive and/or time-consuming. Common knowledge obtained from different (but possibly related) optimization tasks may help enhance the solving of such tasks. In this regard, evolutionary multitasking optimization (EMTO) has been proposed to improve the solving of multiple optimization tasks simultaneously via knowledge transfer in the evolutionary algorithm framework. The effectiveness of knowledge transfer is crucial for the success of EMTO. Multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) is one of the most representative EMTO algorithms, however, it suffers from negative knowledge transfer among the tasks with low correlation. To address this issue, in this study, inter-task gene-similarity-based knowledge transfer and mirror transformation are integrated into MFEA (termed as MFEA-GSMT). In the proposed inter-task gene-similarity-based knowledge transfer, a probabilistic model is used to feature each gene and the Kullback-Leibler divergence is employed to measure the inter-task dimension similarity. Guided by the inter-task gene similarity, a selective crossover is used to reproduce offspring solutions. The proposed inter-task knowledge transfer is based on online gene similarity evaluation, instead of individual similarity, to overcome the imprecise estimation of population distributions in a high-dimensional space with only a small number of samples. The proposed mirror transformation is an extension of opposition-based learning to avoid premature convergence and explore additional promising search areas. Experimental results on both single-objective and multi-objective multi-tasking problems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed MFEA-GSMT."

"‘Typical scripts’ and their silences: exploring myths about sexual violence and LGBTQ people from the perspectives of support workers Rape; Sexual Assault; Offenders Sexism, heterosexism and cissexism shape what is visible and knowable about sexual violence for LGBTQ people. While there is a plethora of research into â€˜rape mythsâ€™ as they pertain to cisgender womenâ€™s experiences of sexual violence perpetrated by cisgender men, comparatively little research examines how myths and stereotypes about sexual violence might impact LGBTQ victims/survivors. This article draws from 29 interviews with sexual assault support workers and LGBTQ community workers in Victoria and South Australia, which form part of a broader study exploring societal discourses about sexual violence for LGBTQ people. In this article, we present findings of a thematic analysis exploring the complex interplay between heterosexist and cissexist ideas about LGBTQ people (their bodies, sexual practices and relationships) as well as myths and stereotypes about sexual violence (what it looks like, what causes it and who is deserving of compassion). The article discusses workersâ€™ views on how myths and stereotypes impact on LGBTQ victims/survivorsâ€™ ability to speak about their experiences of violence and be understood and appropriately supported by others. It is argued that myths and stereotypes can often work to minimise and justify sexual violence, while also blaming LGBTQ victims/survivors for their experiences."

"A study of sustainable practices in the sustainability leadership of international contractors Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative With an increasing global need for sustainable development, numerous world-leading construction corporations have devoted significant efforts to implementing sustainable practices. However, few previous studies have shared these valuable experiences in a systematic and quantitative way. RobecoSAM has published The Sustainability Yearbook annually since 2004, which lists the sustainability leaders in various industries, including the construction industry. Learning from those sustainability leaders in the construction industry can provide useful references for construction-related companies when developing their sustainable development strategies. Based on a comprehensive literature review, this paper identified 51 methods used for improving sustainability performance and 34 outcomes achieved via these methods. These methods and outcomes are used for coding the sustainable practices of sustainability leaders in the construction sector. Using the coding system, 133 annual sustainability reports issued by 22 sustainability leaders (The Sustainability Yearbook, RobecoSAM 2010â€“2016) in the construction sector were analyzed using content analysis. Social network analysis was then employed to identify the key adopted methods and achieved outcomes (KAMAO) of these leaders. The dynamic trend and regional analysis of KAMAO are also presented. These KAMAO findings provide valuable guidance for international contractors to develop a better understanding of the primary sustainable methods adopted by sustainability leaders in the construction sector and the top outcomes achieved by these leaders. The findings also provide a useful reference for international contractors to evaluate their current sustainability-related strategies and make improvements."

"Integrating teaching and learning with inter-disciplinary action research in support of climate resilient urban development Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience The capital cities of the South Pacific are experiencing rapid urbanisation pressures as increasing numbers of people migrate to the primary cities either in search of employment and greater access to healthcare and education, or as a consequence of environmental 'push' factors. However, the limited capacity of municipal Governments to respond to the scale and pace of change is leading to a growth of informal settlements in peri-urban locations. Factors of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity combine to make these informal settlements the most vulnerable areas to natural hazards. In response to this critical urban resilience agenda, this paper looks at how participatory action research is providing inter-disciplinary scientific support for the implementation of urban resilience and climate actions in Honiara, Solomon Islands. Adaptation measures involve a combination of hard and soft actions; as well as activities designed to strengthen local capacity to respond to contemporary resilience challenges. Addressing the adaptive capacity component, this paper also highlights the opportunities for Australian universities to integrate teaching and learning with action research to achieve a substantive real-world impact in the Pacific region, as well as illustrating the capacity strengthening benefits that can be achieved through sustained engagement and collaborative partnerships with local organisations."
"Probing influence factors of implementation patterns for sustainable land consolidation: Insights from seventeen years of practice in Jiangsu province, China Land Consolidation; Agriculture; Cadastres Land consolidation is a key measure in the implementation of agricultural sustainability and has a strategic importance in farmland fragmentation reduction and rural revitalization. In order to understand spatiotemporal patterns of land consolidation implementation and their influences at a large scale, a comprehensive evaluation of 1046 land consolidation projects was conducted in Jiangsu Province, China. The results of this study showed that the construction scale (CS) and investment amount (IA) rose in waves in Jiangsu province during the period 2001-2017, while the newly increased farmland rate (NIFR) continued to decline. Spatial patterns of land consolidation aggregated, whereas the scale and the kernel density of the newly increased farmland area (NIFA) was differentiated in different time periods. In addition, the regional differentiation was significant. The gravity center of CS, IA, and NIFA moved with an overall trend from South Jiangsu to North Jiangsu, and finally stopped at the Li-Xia River plain area in North Jiangsu. The key factors that promoted land consolidation included natural farmland quality and the proportion of the primary industry production in GDP. The potential of NIFA, the farmland production amount, and the income of the financial transferring payment were also important factors. Spatial patterns were initially influenced by natural conditions and were later influenced more significantly by economic and policy conditions. In the future, differentiated land consolidation policy oriented by public involvement should be formulated to improve new frameworks of system implementation, as well as to provide evidence for spatial configuration, district cooperation, policy adjustment, and the systematic improvement of sustainable land consolidation."

"Bamboo as an alternative bioenergy crop and powerful ally for land restoration in Indonesia Culms; Phyllostachys Edulis; Plantation The energy demand in Indonesia has increased significantly with its population growth, urbanization, and economic development. The growing concern of meeting energy demand while reducing dependency on fossil fuels has resulted in an increasing demand for renewable energy. As a country with a rich biomass base, bioenergy is now an important component of Indonesia's energy agenda. However, a crucial problem in bioenergy production is the selection of species that can provide a sustainable supply of feedstock without having an impact on food security and the environment. In this context, we discuss the characteristics and benefits of using bamboo, a perennial grass, as a potential species for bioenergy feedstock in Indonesia. We describe the fuel characteristics of bamboo along with the possibility to align its cultivation, production, and usage with environmental and developmental agendas which makes it a suitable bioenergy crop in the country. In addition, its ability to grow on degraded lands, fast growth, long root system, and easy maintenance prove it as a powerful ally for the restoration of degraded land. We recommend in-depth research on the social, ecological, and economic feasibility of using this species for bioenergy production."

This groundbreaking collection on housing for degrowth addresses key challenges of unaffordable, unsustainable and anti-social housing today, including going beyond struggles for a â€˜right to the cityâ€™ to a â€˜right to metabolismâ€™, advocating refurbishment versus demolition, and revealing controversies within the degrowth movement on urbanisation, decentralisation and open localism. International case studies show how housing for degrowth is based on sufficiency and conviviality, living a â€˜one planet lifestyleâ€™ with a common ecological footprint. This book explores environmental, cultural and economic housing and planning issues from interdisciplinary perspectives such as urbanism, ecological economics, environmental justice, housing studies and policy, planning studies and policy, sustainability studies, political ecology, social change and degrowth. It will appeal to students and scholars across a wide range of disciplines."
"Opportunities and challenges in the development of monoethanolamine and its blends for post-combustion CO2 capture Carbon Dioxide; Nitrosamines; N,N-Bis(2-Hydroxyethyl)Glycine Post-combustion Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture (PCC) via amine absorption-stripping is an evolving technology towards mitigation of CO2 emissions. One of the major challenges in the technology development is the suitability of the solvent. Under the process operating conditions, irreversible reactions occur, thereby degrading the amine. The consequences of amine degradation are inevitable. The degradation products are harmful to the environment, increase the corrosion in the process equipment, cause fouling and ultimately make the process inefficient, hazardous and expensive. Monoethanolamine (MEA) is the benchmark solvent used and tested at industrial level for CO2 capture because of its high absorption rate and capacity to capture CO2 as well as medium to high resistance against oxidative and thermal degradation. This review reports degradation of MEA under process operating conditions, which includes up-to-dated list of degradation products, degradation kinetics and degradation pathways. Furthermore, degradation inhibition, computational studies, corrosivity as well as environmental concerns regarding the emissions of amine degradation products are critically reviewed. The objective of study is to provide researchers with a comprehensive knowledge on degradation of MEA, ways to reduce degradation, corrosion inhibition and understanding of environmental concerns for development of models for better understanding of behaviour of MEA and knowledge gaps."

"Energy poverty and health: Panel data evidence from Australia Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Australia's diverse climate makes it vulnerable to cold winters and extremely warm summers, characterised by severe bushfires and heat waves. Thus, unlike most European countries, energy poverty in Australia is linked with difficulty both maintaining adequate warmth during winter and ensuring adequate cooling during summer. Energy poverty in Australia is, therefore, associated with cold-and-heat-related health issues. We draw on 13 waves of representative panel data for the Australian adult population to examine the relationship between energy poverty and self-assessed health. We use both objective and subjective indicators of energy poverty. We instrument for energy poverty using energy prices. When we instrument for energy poverty, we find that a standard deviation increase in energy poverty is associated with a decline in general health between 0.099 and 0.296 standard deviations. The finding that energy poverty lowers health is robust to different ways of measuring health and alternative methods to addressing endogeneity of energy poverty, including using internal instruments, dynamic panel methods and propensity score matching."

"On the Scalability of Blockchain Systems Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things Blockchain, as a promising solution to develop secure distributed ledgers, has drawn a huge attention over the last decade. By introducing a pseudonymous payment model with no central authority, blockchain marked the new generation of online payment systems, known as Cryptocurrencies. For most of the existing cryptocurrencies, scalability has become a challenging problem. When dealing with an ever increasing number of users, miners, and transactions, the technology is unable to scale and provide the same performance as centralised systems (e.g. centralised payment systems).Without addressing this fundamental scalability problem, such a promising technology may not be able to be adopted in mainstream. This paper provides an attempt to analyse the scalability of existing blockchain protocols and look at the major factors affecting scalability, namely throughput and latency. We also describe the HTNZ protocol, a new approach to improve the scalability of Satoshi Nakamoto's model [1], validated by experimental results. HTNZ introduces two new components, namely, sideBlock and helper. SideBlock has a slightly different structure of block and increases the number of transactions that can be processed per each interval."
On the applicability of empirical drag estimation methods for unmanned air vehicle design Towed Bodies; Helicopter; Tanker Aircraft The drag of several small to medium-sized unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) is analytically calculated with multiple classical drag build-up methods. The analytical results are compared against CFD simulations computed with the commercial software StarCCM+. Systematic differences in the drag contribution of the most important UAV components reveal that the empirical correlations of todayâ€™s drag estimation methods are inappropriate for the considered class of aircraft. Several guidelines for the typical zero-lift drag composition of long range reconnaissance UAVs are presented. The findings show that UAVs should be treated as an individual aircraft class for which specific empirical drag estimation methods are necessary.

An optimum solution to this concern is the substitution of conventional electricity consumption with clean energy sources. Barren lands are available in airport sites as buffer zones. These lands can be utilized to generate electricity from clean energy sources like solar, wind, and others. This study proposed a 5 MW grid-connected solar power plant at airport sites by utilizing the substantial barren area of the airport. The targeted airports for this study are Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, Dhaka, and Shah Amanat International Airport, Chittagong, Bangladesh. Mathematical and simulation analyses have been performed for this purpose. Besides, sustainability analysis has also been incorporated for the grid-connected solar power plant. The energy efficiency varies from 18.74 to 7.79% for the Shah Amanat International Airport, and for the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, it ranges from 17.71 to 7.45%. Based on the project outcome, the revenue earned was 25% higher if the total cost was invested in power plants rather than keeping it in the bank as a deposit. On the other hand, emission analysis presented that a gross reduction of 3827.5 tons of CO2/MWh can be achieved from the Shah Amanat International Airport, while 3926 tons of CO2/MWh can be removed from the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. Based on the sustainability analysis, the energy depletion ratio for Shahjalal Airport varies from 0.82 to 0.93, while for Shah Amanat Airport, it is in the range of 0.81 and 0.92. The findings of this study suggested that investment in grid-connected solar power plants is economically viable and environmentally benign."

"Perovskite solar cells with a hybrid electrode structure Perovskite Solar Cells; Solar Cell; Formamidine Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a novel hybrid electrode structure, in which a single device can operate with either a vertical (sandwich) or lateral (back-contact) configuration of contacts, are demonstrated in this work. The hybrid structure was achieved by depositing an additional anode on top of a prefabricated back-contact PSC device, giving a final device with three electrodes-one shared cathode and two anodes. Device performances are tested and evaluated for both operation modes, and a semianalytical model along with coupled optoelectronic simulations is used to rationalize the experimental results. It is determined that due to the intrinsically narrow depletion region near the contact interfaces, the charge collection efficiency in the back-contact device structure appears to be significantly lower compared to the sandwich device structure. This finding provides an insight into the cause of the performance disparity between these two architectures."

"Scaled-up ‘safety-net’ schooling and the ‘wicked problem’ of educational exclusion in South Australia: problem or solution? Alternative Education; Young; Disengagement In this article, we investigate a major, long-running policy intervention to combat educational exclusion in South Australia (SA): the Interagency Community Action Networks (ICAN)-Flexible Learning Options (FLO) policy and program agenda (ICAN-FLO). SA is unique for having the only bureaucratically systematised â€˜social inclusionâ€™ schooling approach to the problem of early school leaving in Australia. We frame ICAN-FLO using the concept of wicked problems in policy and specify how some problematic features of ICAN-FLO since its inception in 2007 are predicted by this concept. Problems with ICAN-FLO include a lack of public accountability; shortcomings in transparency about attainment of students enrolled in ICAN-FLO; and the consequent danger that public confidence in ICAN-FLO will be undermined. Constructive suggestions to address these weaknesses are offered, including, more conceptual policy work in partnership with collective and independent stakeholder inquiry and research. We conclude that one ever-present danger with bureaucratically scaled-up social inclusion initiatives like ICAN-FLO is that such initiatives become a parallel â€˜safety-netâ€™ education system for the disadvantaged and thereby corrode the principle of an inclusive mainstream education system meeting the needs of all children and young people in SA or elsewhere."
"Bullying in the workplace: a cross-cultural and methodological perspective Mobbing; Incivility; Nurses Whilst research on workplace bullying has substantially increased internationally, there appears to be a contention of whether individuals in hierarchical or individualistic societies are at higher risk of exposure to such behavior. This paper reports an investigation of relative exposure to workplace bullying between the two societies through a survey of Australians and Pakistanis. In so doing, this paper advances the cross-cultural workplace bullying literature in two main ways. First, by examining the methodological issue of equivalence, this paper shows that despite workplace bullyingâ€™s constant meaning across cultures, there are stark differences in employee exposure and tolerance toward it between the assessed cultures. Second, it provides evidence of relative risks of workplace bullying in cross-cultural contexts by revealing a higher risk of exposure to such behavior in a hierarchical rather than an individualistic society. The paper concludes with a detailed discussion of the theoretical and international management practice implications of the research findings."

Extraction-then-abstraction and extraction-with-abstraction are two representative approaches to hybrid summarization. But their general performance is yet to be evaluated by large scale experiments.We examined two state-of-the-art hybrid summarization algorithms from three novel perspectives: we applied them to a form of headline generation not previously tried, we evaluated the generalization of the algorithms by testing them both within and across news domains; and we compared the automatic assessment of the algorithms to human comparative judgments. It is found that an extraction-then-abstraction hybrid approach outperforms an extraction-with-abstraction approach, particularly for cross-domain headline generation."

"The effect of smoke derivatives and carbon utilisation on symbiotic germination of the endangered pterostylis despectans (Orchidaceae) Germination; Tulasnella; Cephalanthera Orchids are highly dependent on exogenous nutritional sources and mycorrhizal associations to survive, particularly when challenged by extreme environmental stress such as bushfires that contribute significantly to its decline in nature. In this study, the effect of smoke derivatives and carbon utilisation was explored to improve germination and seedling establishment of an Australian endangered orchid, Pterostylis despectans (Lowly Greenhood) and its mycorrhizal fungi. Stored seeds were germinated in vitro with peloton-isolated fungal isolates with varying concentrations of smoke water (0-1.0 mL L-1) to simulate fire and sucrose as the carbon source (10 g L-1). Smoke water significantly increased germination, with advanced protocorms and robust seedlings produced. Sucrose inhibited germination such that protocorms and leafing was absent with sucrose inclusion. Fungal isolates were highly variable on its germination efficacy and tolerance to smoke water, highlighting the importance of fungal diversity and supports research-based conservation strategies to circumvent environmental challenges."

"Assessing block-level sustainable transport infrastructure development using a spatial trade-off relation model Pavements; Road Maintenance; Roads Increasing quantity and quality of roads are pathways to sustainable road infrastructure development. Understanding quantity-quality relations of road sustainability is critically required for strategic decision making. However, few knowledge are available about assessing quantity-quality relations of road sustainability from a perspective of spatial disparities. Here, we developed a Spatial Trade-Off Relation (STOR) model for assessing road quantity-quality trade-off relations at 42,425 blocks in Western Australia (WA). First, a sustainable road infrastructure index (SRII), including quantity and quality phases, was developed regarding stakeholder requirements and using multiple spatial methods to examine block-level road sustainability. Next, quantity-quality trade-off relations for road sustainability was investigated using a diminishing marginal utility approach. Further, spatial disparities of quantity-quality trade-offs were assessed through the spatial clustering based identification of hotspots and cold spots in trade-offs. Finally, contributions of the road quantity-quality interaction to economic development were estimated with the consideration of non-linear and geographically local characteristics of the associations using a generalized additive model and geographically weighted regression. We found three stages of the quantity-quality relations of road sustainability, including the increasing, marginal, and negative returns. The increasing return revealed the simultaneous growth of quantity and quality in outer and remote regions, and marginal and negative returns were primarily located in major cities. In addition, regional disparities of the trade-offs were found from the identified blocks, towns and villages, where quantity and quality were spatially clustered, for informing priorities of future strategic decisions. We also found that the contribution of road quality was about three times the contribution of quantity to resident income. This study demonstrated that efforts regarding regional quantity-quality trade-offs were required to achieve global sustainable infrastructure development goals."
"Assessment of Tropical Cyclone Risk to Coral Reefs: Case Study for Australia Coral Bleaching; Anthozoa; Reefs In this study, we attempt to expand tropical cyclone (TC) risk assessment methodology and build an understanding of TC risk to Australiaâ€™s natural environment by focusing on coral reefs. TCs are natural hazards known to have the potential to bring destruction due to associated gale-force winds, torrential rain, and storm surge. The focus of TC risk assessment studies has commonly centred around impacts on human livelihoods and infrastructure exposed to TC events. In our earlier study, we created a framework for assessing multi-hazard TC risk to the Australian population and infrastructure at the Local Government Area level. This methodology is used in this study with coral reefs as the focus. TC hazard, exposure, and vulnerability indices were created from selected coral-related datasets to calculate an overall TC risk index for the Ningaloo Reef (NR) and the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) regions. The obtained results demonstrate that the northern NR and the southern GBR had the highest risk values within the study area; however, limitations in data quality have meant that results are estimates at best. The study has shown the potential benefits of such a TC risk assessment framework that can be improved upon, as coral data collection becomes more readily available."

"Topological optimization of continuum structures for additive manufacturing considering thin feature and support structure constraints Topology Optimization; Numerical Methods; Compliant Mechanisms This article proposes a design method to minimize the compliance or maximize the fundamental natural frequency of continuum structures under thin feature and support structure constraints in additive manufacturing processes. The objective functions are, respectively, to minimize the compliance of continuum structures under static loads and maximize the fundamental natural frequency of vibrating continuum structures. The topology optimization is performed by the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method. The sensitivity expressions for minimizing the compliance or maximizing the fundamental natural frequency are derived in detail. Different thin feature constraints and the support structure constraints in different printing directions are investigated. Several two- and three-dimensional numerical examples involving compliance minimization and eigenfrequency maximization show that the proposed method is effective in achieving convergent solidâ€“void optimized solutions for a variety of optimization problems of continuum structures, and the designs resulting from the new topology optimization algorithm are additive manufacturing friendly."

"Effect of Internal Stirrups on the Eccentric Compression Behavior of FRP-Confined RC Columns Based on Finite-Element Analysis Axial Compression; Polymers; Jackets Fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs) have been widely used in the retrofitting and rehabilitation of reinforced concrete (RC) columns because they can provide substantial lateral confinement to concrete. Conventionally, the presence of internal stirrups is neglected in the retrofitting design due to a lack of understanding on the effect of internal hoops when both external FRP and internal steel confinement exist, particularly under eccentric loading. In this study, a finite-element (FE) method is developed to investigate the eccentric compression behavior of FRP-confined RC columns. A reliable concrete plastic-damage model that accurately considers the confining stiffness ratio between the FRP and steel is proposed for the first time, which facilitates the study of a difficult problem: the behavior of RC columns with the dual confinement system under eccentric loading. The accuracy of the model is verified by test results. An extensive parametric study of various affecting factors is carried out to investigate the confinement mechanisms of the concrete columns in terms of the axial stress and confining pressure distributions, lateral principal stress ratio, local stress-strain response, and interaction between the FRP/steel hoops and concrete. It is found that the nonuniform confining pressures under eccentric compression are significantly affected by the internal stirrups. With the existence of discrete transverse steel reinforcement, the axial resistance of the concrete core is increased, thereby improving the ultimate load capacity of the columns. An ultimate axial load model for RC columns that considered combined FRP-steel confinement is subsequently proposed. More accurate results are obtained using the proposed model compared with those calculated from existing design codes."

"Impact of self-assembly on the photovoltaic properties of a small molecule oligothiophene donor Polymer Solar Cells; Polymers; Organic Photovoltaics The positive impact of self-assembly on the photovoltaic properties of a donor-Ï€-acceptor oligothiophene molecule coded as CP3, which contains a barbituric acid as a terminal acceptor unit and triphenylamine as donor, enabling hydrogen-bonded spherulites to assemble in its films is described. The hydrogen-bonded supramolecular array of barbiturated-oligothiophene molecules were directly visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Bulk-heterojunction solar cells comprising CP3 and the fullerene PC61BM show a power conversion efficiency of 6.31%, which is markedly higher than a structural analogue CP4, which comprises a N-ethylrhodanine terminal acceptor unit incapable of participating in the same degree of self-assembly, supporting the impact of self-assembly in BHJ devices."

"Low-energy housing as a means of improved social housing: Benefits, challenges and opportunities Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Rising energy costs are significantly impacting low-income households. These households can struggle to pay their utility bills, and/or self-ration how much energy they consume which impacts on liveability within the home, such as the provision of appropriate thermal comfort. While incremental progress is being made in terms of improving the energy efficiency of housing in many developed countries, such improvements are typically inaccessible to low-income or social housing tenants. This chapter presents outcomes of a multi-year evaluation of a cohort of low-energy social housing from Horsham in regional Victoria, Australia. The analysis includes technical performance data and is supplemented with the occupantsâ€™ own stories about improved liveability outcomes. It is clear that the evidence supports aspirations by the state housing agency, which owns and maintains the housing, to move beyond their current minimum housing standards for new construction. A combination approach, whereby the thermal performance of the dwelling is improved, in addition to including renewable energy generation, will address several goals of social (or public) housing providersâ€”namely improving quality of life, health outcomes, finances and poverty. In addition, such housing will help them achieve organisational or broader government sustainability goals such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel energy consumption."

"Ecological correlates of activity-related behavior typologies among adolescents Exercise; Sedentary Lifestyle; Preschool Children Background: Adolescents engage in various combinations (typologies) of physical activity and sedentary behaviors, which impact their health and wellbeing in different ways. As such, there is a need to understand the factors that may inhibit or facilitate engagement in combinations of activity-related behaviors to help inform effective intervention strategies targeting those most in need. The aim of this study was to identify ecological correlates of adolescent physical activity and sedentary behavior typologies. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 473 adolescents (15.0 Â± 1.6 years, 41.4% boys) from 18 secondary schools in Melbourne, Australia. Intrapersonal, interpersonal and neighborhood-physical environmental factors were assessed via self-report surveys and Geographic Information Systems. Multinomial logistic regression models determined the relative risk ratio of membership of three homogenous activity-related behavior typologies based on the potential correlates. Results: Higher levels of self-efficacy for physical activity, parental screen-time restriction rules, parental support for physical activity, sibling screen-time co-participation and perceptions of neighborhood pedestrian/traffic safety were associated with greater likelihood of adolescents being in the typology defined as highly active and low sedentary compared to the physically inactive, highly sedentary typology. Higher frequency of co-participation in screen-time with friends was associated with greater likelihood of adolescents being in the typology defined as moderately active, high screen-time compared to physically inactive, highly sedentary. Conclusions: A range of intrapersonal, interpersonal and environmental correlates appear to play a role in adolescent activity-related typology membership. The findings may inform public health interventions targeting unique adolescent subgroups most at risk of poor health outcomes based on their engagement in combinations of activity-related behaviors."

"Influence of formal and informal stakeholder relationship on megaproject performance: a case of China Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management Purpose: The purpose of this research is to seek better relational strategies between formal and informal stakeholder relationships to improve megaproject performance. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual model was developed with twenty hypotheses based on the literature review. Then a questionnaire survey was conducted, and the collected data were analyzed by Partial Least squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) for validating the proposed model. Finally, the findings were discussed by a comparative study to explain the different effects of the formal and informal relationship on megaproject performance, and the managerial implications are presented for the stakeholders to implement the relationship management in the megaprojects. Findings: The research finding reveals that formal relationship plays a dominating role in cost, quality, and labor protection; meanwhile, it is still more reliable in improving coordination, safety and environmental protection. Both formal and informal relationship is equally important towards collaboration and scheduling while the informal relationship is more effective in communication and project transparency. Originality/value: The study extends the knowledge of relationship management in the domain of the megaproject performance. It provides a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the impact of formal and informal stakeholder relationships on ten aspects of the megaproject performance by the proposed conceptual model and PLS-SEM results. The research findings contribute to the theory of relationship management on how the different influences between formal and informal stakeholder relationships lead to better megaproject performance from inter-organizational level to project and societal level."
"The economic dynamics and population change of Australia’s regional cities Regional Development; Leadership; Governance Arrangement Key points This analysis is based on data from the 2011 and 2016 censuses, and does not take into account the redistributions and changes that may have occurred with COVID-19. This report can be seen as providing a baseline for subsequent analysis of the changes that have occurred and continue to occur, identifying the trends and conditions across regional Australiaâ€™s urban centres prior to 2020. Populations in regional urban centres are growing overallâ€”however, this growth is differentiated. Regional urban centre population growth is associated with proximity to major cities, and to coastal locations. Regional urban centre population decline is associated with remoteness and exposure to the resource economy. Capital cities are the main source of migration to regional urban centres, principally coastal and satellite centres with regional-to-regional-centre migration highly self-contained. International migration follows similar distribution. Commuting between regional centres and proximate capital cities increased over 2011â€“2016, indicating increased peri-metropolitan dependency on metropolitan interactions. Employment growth is associated with population growth, particularly for the larger metropolitan satellite and coastal regional citiesâ€”however, this is also associated with lower wage growth due to the employment mix. Health, community service, construction, hospitality and accommodation increased their share of regional employment. Industries associated with agglomeration economies are concentrating in fewer urban centres, while those associated with population services are becoming more dispersed. National economic growth factors appear to expert greater influence on employment growth in regional urban centres, while industry factors exert very limited influence. Regional effects exert greater influence than industry effects, although these are unevenly distributed. In 135 of 198 cases, a regional urban centre exhibits employment growth along with its surrounding functional economic region. For 33 regional urban centres there is positive divergence, while for 25 there is negative divergence. Four regional urban centres are declining within a declining functional economic region. Factors associated with stronger employment growth include employment factors, industry factors (especially those dependent on population growth), while income growth was less associated with employment growth. Population change exerted a strong influence on employment growth, as did human capital factors. Housing market (i.e. price) growth is strongly associated with population growth, while locational factors exhibited low associations. Cluster analysis identified nine distinctive regional urban centre groups: metro-satellites; large regional cities; medium growth cities; regional service centres; ageing population centres; agricultural centres; mining centres; industrial centres, and northern Queensland centres. Policy development should consider the following: Policy and planning measures to address the phenomenon of growth in metropolitan satellite regional urban centres, and the need to ensure coherent population, housing and employment distribution and linkages. Coordinated economic and social development approaches to emerging low-income service economies in coastal regional urban centres. Long-term transition planning to address resource-dependent regional urban centres facing cyclical economic changes based on the labour intensity of construction relative to ongoing economic activity. Opportunities and mechanisms to leverage high-wage economic development from existing regional city industry clusters. Opportunities and mechanisms for regional spatial coordination of fiscal policy to optimise development of high-wage employment in suitable regional urban centres. The study Purpose The contribution of regional urban centres to Australiaâ€™s economic and population growth has been a topic of growing policy interest in the past two decades, as a result of rapid growth in the major cities and concerns for parts of regional Australia that have experienced population decline. Associated with these trends is the distribution of economic activity and employmentâ€”particularly as traditional regional strengths such as agriculture, manufacturing and mining have declined as sources of employment in recent decades. Over the same period, metropolitan areas have prospered because of concentrations of high-skill, high-wage knowledge work, indicating diverging regional fortunes as a result of wider economic trends. The purpose of this research is to investigate patterns and dynamics of population, migration and economic change in Australian regional urban centres 2011â€“2016. The research is principally an empirically focused investigation identifying patterns and dynamic processes of regional change using advanced spatial analytical techniques, but provides an information base that will support future policy development efforts. Inquiry This research is part of a wider AHURI Inquiry into population growth in Australiaâ€™s smaller cities. The Inquiry asks two overarching questions: First, what is the capacity of Australiaâ€™s smaller cities to assist in managing national population growth, including international and national migration? Second, which policy instruments and programs are most likely to redirect population movements to these locations? Study This research investigates two overarching questions related to the Inquiry: How can we differentiate Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres according to economic profile, population trajectory, industry structure and geography? What are the current mobility and settlement patterns of migrants, including those arriving from other parts of Australia and from other nations, across these smaller cities? Three further research questions are posed by this project: 1. How can a typology of smaller cities assist to understand their role in regional, state and national economies? 2. How are Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres differentiated in terms of economic profile, population trajectory and industry structure? 3. What demographic, economic and spatial factors are associated with economic and population growth, and what attributes are associated with better economic performance of regional urban centres? Approach and methods For Research question 1: the project undertakes longitudinal measures of social, demographic and industry change in regional cities 2011â€“2016 using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census data. Next, flow analysis and mapping of migration is applied to identify key migration patterns. Migration flows are used to construct migration regions via modularity analysis. Similar techniques are used to identify journey to work flows from which functional economic regions are constructed. Shift share of employment change and location quotient analysis of employment is used to understand economic change and industry structure. For Research question 2, to understand how Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres are differentiated the project applies hierarchical cluster and discriminant analysis to construct a typology of regional urban centres. This is based on a combination of economic, demographic and geographic factors. These are compiled into summary data and descriptive explanations. For Research question 3: the study applies structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify the relationships between economic, social and demographic factors affecting population change and economic growth in regional urban centres. Key findings Differentiating Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres are heterogeneous in terms of size, location within the Australian continent and settlement structures, level of employment, industrial mix and degree of interaction with regional, metropolitan, national and international economic processes and dynamics. In 2016, there were 198 Australian regional urban centres that had populations greater than 5,000 residents. Most are experiencing population growth. However this growth is differentiated across a range of factors, including: the existing size of the centre location relative to the coast location relative to an existing major capital city. A small number of regional urban centres are experiencing population decline. These centres are largely associated with the resource economy. They are typically positioned in remote locations in Australia. Migration Migration is a major factor in population change within regional urban centres. Migration patterns are clearly structured at the regional scale, with distinct geographies of intra-regional movement that include discernible levels of self-containment. There is a sizeable phenomenon of major city to regional urban centre migration, especially in the south-east of Australia. Beyond the major metropolitan zones, there are larger internally connected migration regions, which often involving movement between adjacent regional urban centres. Some regional urban centres lose and receive populations across long distances. For example, the Northern Territory (NT) operates as a single migration region, partly because of its relatively small population and large scaleâ€”although the volumes of movement are relatively small."

"Molecular identification and characterization of probiotic bacillus species with the ability to control vibrio spp. In wild fish intestines and sponges from the vietnam sea Microorganisms; Probiotic Agent; Fingerlings Vibriosis in farmed animals is a serious threat to aquaculture worldwide. Using probiotics and anti-Vibrio antimicrobial substances in aquaculture systems can be a means of preventing Vibrio infections. Therefore, we aimed to characterize and compare 16 potential anti-Vibrio probiotics (Vi+) isolated from marine sponges and fish intestines collected from the Vietnam Sea, as well as an anti-Vibrio bacteriocin to fully explore their application potentials. 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed all Vi+ to be Bacillus species with different strain variants across two sample types. An obvious antimicrobial spectrum toward Gram-negative bacteria was observed from intestinal Vi+ compared to sponge-associated Vi+. The reason was the higher gene frequency of two antimicrobial compounds, non-ribosomal peptides (NRPS) and polyketide type-I (PKS-I) from intestinal Vi+ (66.7%) than sponge-associated Vi+ (14.3% and 0%, respectively). Additionally, a three-step procedure was performed to purify an anti-Vibrio bacteriocin produced by B. methylotrophicus NTBD1, including (i) solvent extraction of bacteriocin from cells, (ii) hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and (iii) reverse-phase HPLC. The bacteriocin had a molecular weight of ~2â€“5 kDa, was sensitive to proteolysis and thermally stable, and showed a broad antimicrobial spectrum, all of which are essential properties for promising feed additives. This study provides necessary information of the potential of probiotic Bacillus species with anti-Vibrio antimicrobial properties to study their further use in sustainable aquaculture."

"Effects of solution matrix on moringa oleifera seeds and banana peel in eliminating heavy metals, fluoride and turbidity from synthetic groundwater samples Biosorption; Isotherms; Aqueous Solution Plant-based biomass has become an environmental-friendly water purification agent in replacing conventional chemicals. In the previous study, Moringa oleifera (MO) seeds and banana peel (BP) have been selected based on their moderate to high effectiveness in removing lead, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, turbidity, and fluoride from synthetic groundwater samples. This study was aimed to investigate further the effects of solution matrix on the biomass effectiveness. Batch experiments were conducted by using coagulation technique and the initial pH of the solutions was controlled to be at pH 7. The results demonstrate that the removal rates for most of the pollutants in multi-contaminant solution were higher compared to the single-contaminant solution. The reason could be due to electrostatic or mutual interactions between contaminants present in the solution thus improved the removal rates of those contaminants. In terms of performance, combination of MO and BP either dosed in mixing (MO+BP) or sequential manner (i.e., MOâ†’BP or BPâ†’MO) are seen can improve the treatment performance by single biomass for most of the target contaminants. The findings are significantly important to understand the effects and removal behavior of the biomass in different solution matrix."
"A framework for assessing agricultural extension approaches and an analysis of transferrable public health approaches. This project will generate practical insights and actionable recommendations for how ACIAR programs can better integrate cutting-edge agricultural practice change and community engagement praxis. The project will first review the extensive peer-reviewed literature from the Mekong region in order to create a framework that compares different models and approaches and their strengths
and weaknesses. This will be done for both the fields of public health and agricultural extension in order to explore areas for cross-disciplinary learning. The project will then use this topography and learning to build on the work from SRA ASEM 2016-047 and develop, trial and refine a diagnostic framework for ACIAR to assess proposals to ensure that agricultural practice change and community
engagement are at, or redefining, the cutting edge of agricultural extension. Knowledge products from the project will include an academic publication, data briefs, a face-to-face workshop, recommendations for ACIAR commissioned research project teams, a diagnostic framework and guidance documents for ACIAR."

"Personality and pay: Do gender gaps in confidence explain gender gaps in wages? Locus of Control; Labour Market; Personality Traits This study explores whether gender patterns in personality traits contribute to the gender gap in hourly wage rates, focusing on traits that reflect an individual's confidence to take on a challenge. To capture confidence, we use a psychological measurement known as Achievement Motivation, which is dually comprised of 'hope for success' and 'fear of failure'. This personality dimension is examined in addition to the Big Five personality traits and Locus of Control (LOC). Using 2013 wage data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, our Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition model reveals that men's stronger hope for success, lower fear of failure and lower agreeableness contribute to the gender wage gap, while women's higher level of conscientiousness is the only trait that serves to narrow it."

"Understanding teachers' cross-disciplinary collaboration for STEAM education: Building a digital community of practice Creative Performance; Implicit Theories; Critical Thinking While creativity was previously considered a specialised ability, over the last 20 years creativity has been reframed as an open set of creative thinking skills and knowledge practices that all teachers can develop through a cross-disciplinary pedagogical approach. STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) has emerged as a cross-disciplinary learning model which explicitly aims to develop creative thinking skills across and through the disciplines. However, teachersâ€™ lack of tacit knowledge in cross-disciplinary collaboration has created challenges and made it hard to implement STEAM in schools. Inspired by the approach of knowledge management, also known as Community of Practice (CoP), and how industries facilitate tacit knowledge propagation across departments to promote creativity through digital support, this article investigates how a Digital-CoP system may potentially support teachersâ€™ cross-disciplinary collaboration. This paper prototypes a Digital CoP System for real world teachers to evaluate. It uses a mixed methods approach to understand teachersâ€™ cross-disciplinary collaboration perception through a Digital-CoP System from the knowledge propagation perspective and points out the further enhancement of the Digital-CoP System enabling it to promote teachers' cross-disciplinary collaboration across Arts and STEM."

"Study on strength and deformation characteristics of cemented gangue backfill body under the coupling action of load and salt erosion Backfill; Tailings; Ointment The durability of backfill body is very important to maintain the stability of goaf. To explore the long-term strength and deformation characteristics of backfill body under the coupling action of load and salt erosion, the cemented gangue backfill body (CGBB) under different compressive stress levels was eroded in MgSO4 solution for 210 days. The ultrasonic and resistivity changes of CGBB at different ages were monitored and the microstructure of CGBB was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the compressive strength of CGBB increased with the rise of compressive stress level, and the compressive strength of the eroded specimens was less than that of the not eroded specimens. The deformation of CGBB increased with the increase of time and compressive stress level, and there was still a certain increase in the later deformation of the eroded CGBB. The ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) of eroded CGBB can be divided into three stages: rapid growth, slow growth and gradual decrease. The resistivity of the eroded CGBB decreased rapidly in the early stage, and then increases slowly. The greater the compressive stress is, the smaller the growth rate is. By analyzing microstructure, the formation of expansion products changed the compactness of CGBB in different erosion stages, and the compressive stress within 50 % stress-strength ratio inhibited the erosion of CGBB. The research results can provide reference for the design of backfill body."

"Greenhouse gas emissions of different fly ash based geopolymer concretes in building construction Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali Replacing virgin materials with recycled or sustainable materials to reduce energy consumptions and emissions is the focus of contemporary research to reduce building related emissions. Geopolymer concrete produced using 100% fly ash is a similar sustainable construction material capable of replacing Portland Cement (PC) concrete. As a replacement for PC, fly ash seems to be a sustainable solution, however the benefits from the production process of fly ash geopolymer (FAGP) concrete is the subject of considerable debate. In addition, factors such as local availability and transportation issues could potentially increase the emission profile of FAGP concrete. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the emission profiles for different types of fly ash in Australia considering availability and transportation. A case study and a scenario analysis are also presented to demonstrate the factors that affect the Green House Gas (GHG) emission profile of FAGP manufacture. The results indicate that to the GHG emission profile for FAGP concrete changes considerably based on the material availability, transportation and mix design. Alkali activators and elevated heat curing processes also significantly contribute the total GHG emissions of FAGP concrete production. The results further signify that the case study location could influence the employment of FAGP concrete in terms of GHG emissions. Further studies are encouraged on optimising the cost, GHG emissions, availability and strength characteristics to strike a balance between in sustainability for selecting the best FAGP type for construction. The results also provide the initial factors to be considered in developing a guideline for employing sustainable materials in the building industry."

"Marine Protists and Rhodotorula Yeast as Bio-Convertors of Marine Waste into Nutrient-Rich Deposits for Mangrove Ecosystems Schizochytrium; Labyrinthulida; Docosahexaenoic Acid This paper represents a comprehensive study of two new thraustochytrids and a marine Rhodotorula red yeast isolated from Australian coastal waters for their abilities to be a potential renewable feedstock for the nutraceutical, food, fishery and bioenergy industries. Mixotrophic growth of these species was assessed in the presence of different carbon sources: glycerol, glucose, fructose, galactose, xylose, and sucrose, starch, cellulose, malt extract, and potato peels. Up to 14 g DW/L (4.6 gDW/L-day and 2.8 gDW/L-day) of biomass were produced by Aurantiochytrium and Thraustochytrium species, respectively. Thraustochytrids biomass contained up to 33% DW of lipids, rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6, 124 mg/g DW); up to 10.2 mg/gDW of squalene and up to 61 Î¼g/gDW of total carotenoids, composed of astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, echinenone, and Î²-carotene. Along with the accumulation of these added-value chemicals in biomass, thraustochytrid representatives showed the ability to secrete extracellular polysaccharide matrixes containing lipids and proteins. Rhodotorula sp lipids (26% DW) were enriched in palmitic acid (C16:0, 18 mg/gDW) and oleic acid (C18:1, 41 mg/gDW). Carotenoids (87 Î¼g/gDW) were mainly represented by Î²-carotene (up to 54 Î¼g/gDW). Efficient growth on organic and inorganic sources of carbon and nitrogen from natural and anthropogenic wastewater pollutants along with intracellular and extracellular production of valuable nutrients makes the production of valuable chemicals from isolated species economical and sustainable."

"Improvement of anaerobic digestion of sewage mixed sludge using free nitrous acid and Fenton pre-treatment Activated Sludge; Anaerobic Digestion; Pretreatment Background: Recently, it has been indicated that free nitrous acid (FNA) and Fenton pre-treatment of waste activated sludge can enhance methane production in anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge. In addition, it has been revealed that the substances used in these pre-treatments are both eco-friendly and economically attractive because not only are they produced in anaerobic digestion, but they are also low priced. Since primary sludge and waste activated sludge are mixed prior to anaerobic digestion in the majority of wastewater treatment plants, this study aims to assess the influence of combined FNA and Fenton on the anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge. Results: According to this study's results, methane generation from anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge was enhanced when using FNA and Fenton pre-treatment, affirming the effectiveness of the individual and combined pre-treatments in anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge. The enhanced methane production was significant in combined pre-treatments (up to 72%), compared with FNA and Fenton pre-treatment alone (25% and 27%, respectively). This corroborates the positive synergistic effect of the combined pre-treatments on methane production. The enhanced methane can be attributed to augmented soluble fractions of organic matter in addition to increased readily biodegradable organic matter, caused by the pre-treatments. Additionally, the amount of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was assessed during anaerobic digestion, and it was revealed that COD decreased considerably when the pre-treatment strategies were combined. Conclusions: This study reveals that the pre-treatments are potentially applicable to full-scale wastewater treatment plants because a mixture of primary sludge and waste activated sludge was used for the pre-treatments. Additionally, combined FNA and Fenton pre-treatments prove more effective in enhancing methane production and organic removal than these pre-treatments alone. The enhanced methane production is important for two reasons: a higher amount of renewable energy could be generated from the enhanced methane production and the COD of digested sludge reduces in such a way that facilitates application of the sludge to agricultural lands and reduces sludge transport costs."

"Multiagent Information Fusion for Connected Driving: A Review Random Sets; Multi-Target Tracking; Clutter This paper reviews the state-of-the-art multi-sensor fusion approaches applicable in the next-generation intelligent transportation systems where connected vehicles are cooperatively driven for maximum safety and efficiency. The review finds out that complementary sensor fusion in a time-varying distributed network is required, and for such applications, the state-of-the-art is sensor fusion in the random finite set filtering framework. The fundamental bases of random finite set filters are reviewed with more elaboration on a particular filter called the Labeled Multi-Bernoulli filter. An information-theoretic approach for data fusion based on minimizing information divergence between statistical densities is presented, along with how different divergence functions can be used for sensor fusion. Different approaches are evaluated for their tracking performance and computational cost in a realistic simulation scenario. Their advantages, and disadvantages in the context of real-time implementation in a connected driving scenario are discussed."

"Gender crime convergence over twenty years: Evidence from Australia Property Crime Rate; Crime; Deterrence Historically men have been responsible for the majority of criminal activity and dominate prison populations around the globe. The twentieth century witnessed significant maleâ€“female convergence in a myriad of positive dimensions including human capital acquisition, labour force participation and wages. This has prompted the question, to what extent are women â€˜looking more like menâ€™? In this paper we examine whether similar forces are at play in the context of criminality. We study the pattern of gender convergence in crime using rich administrative data on the population of young people in Queensland, Australia. The evidence points to a significant narrowing of the gender gap in criminal activity over the course of the last twenty years. Crime convergence occurs for broad aggregates of both property and violent crime, as well as for almost all sub-component categories. Convergence occurs largely because crime has fallen significantly for men, combined with no downward trend for women. This is confirmed by aggregate analysis of rates of offending in police force districts matched to Census data by gender between 2001 and 2016."

"Social Workers as Collaborators? The Ethics of Working Within Australia’s Asylum System* Refugees; Migrant Workers; Asylum Social workers working within the Australian asylum seeker processing system, particularly offshore on Nauru and Manus Island, risk being collaborators in the systemic abuse of men, women and children who seek asylum in Australia. In order to avoid accusations of collaboration, social workers must work to end this abuse. However, the current policy environment makes this very difficult, with social workers who resist the status quo risking unemployment, public shaming and imprisonment. Using freedom of information disclosures, whistleblower testimony, leaked documents, parliamentary records, case law, media reports and academic literature, this paper examines this difficult position. Alternatives to retreating from the system are proposed, including advocacy through whistleblowing, policy reform and litigation, or subversive action from within. Social workers are encouraged to act in whatever ways they can, within the ethical, legal and practical limitations which are imposed."

"Factors influencing intention to adopt ICT among intensive shrimp farmers Shrimp Culture; Farmers; Aquaculture Intensive shrimp production has been considered one way to increase output quantity. However, many factors need to be considered to maintain product quality, sustained practice, and environmental compliance. The adoption of monitoring technologies in shrimp farming such as monitoring important water quality parameters including temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and salinity, offers several benefits, including increasing farming processes and cost efficiency and reducing harmful environmental impacts. A sampled survey dataset comprising 184 shrimp farmers from Ca Mau, Kien Giang, and Soc Trang provinces in Vietnam, one of the world largest shrimp producers, was used to examine factors that affect farmers' adoption of aquaculture information and communication technologies (ICT). The study empirically tested an adoption model using technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior under perceived production risks. Results suggest that farmers who both perceive the ICT as being useful in their shrimp farms and are influenced by other important peers are more likely to adopt aquaculture technologies. Farmers who feel confident to learn a new technology are likely to find the technology easier to use than someone who is not as confident. Due to the inherent risky nature of intensive shrimp production, even if Vietnamese shrimp farmers perceive a high level of technology-adoption risk, they still feel more confident towards learning to use a new ICT and its usefulness, and are therefore likely to increase their adoption. The study's results suggest ICT service providers should collaborate with local aquaculture departments to develop pilot farms to showcase new aquaculture technologies and demonstrate key features and their compatibility with existing farms' infrastructure, which will consequently entice farmers to quickly adopt shrimp monitoring technologies."
"Life cycle sustainability assessment for modular construction - A proposed conceptual framework Sustainability; United Nations Environment Program; Social Indicators Offsite construction (OSC) is increasingly recognised as a viable alternative for conventional in-situ construction. Modular construction (MC) is one of the most advanced and efficient OSC methods in the construction industry. Even with the distinctive benefits offered by MC, it is imperative to investigate the sustainability performance of MC to understand the trade-offs with traditional construction. Life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) is a tool that integrates the three pillars of sustainability from a life cycle perspective. At present, the most common method is to consider the LCSA as a sum of life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC), and social LCA (S-LCA). However, studies that have employed the LCSA methodology in assessing MC are still lacking in the literature. Relevant literature still lacks comprehensive framework guidance to conduct LCSA of MC. Thus, this paper aims to propose a conceptual framework that integrates the triple bottom line (TBL) of sustainability to assess the sustainability performance of MC using LCSA. The publications acquired from the keyword search analysis were reviewed to develop the conceptual framework by identifying the key factors and challenges to the LCSA. The framework integrates the methodological steps, findings, and gaps related to LCSA discovered from the literature survey. The results show that the LCSA goal and scope should be defined properly to address the complications from the methodological differences of the TBL of sustainability. The proposed framework offers insight to academia and construction industry practitioners about the holistic investigation of the sustainability performance of MC."
"Housing and economic inequality in the long run: The retreat of owner occupation Home Ownership; Housing Wealth; Real Estate Market Finally, after a lengthy hiatus, the empirical facts of economic inequality need no introduction. In a blaze of publicity during a decade or more, the re-polarization of income and wealth across nearly half a century has been widely documented and is substantially uncontested. There is debate on whether incomes have peaked, no doubt that capital is back, and a great deal of speculation on what might happen next. What is surprising is the limited attention afforded to the pivotal role of housing. To address that gap, conceptually and empirically, this paper draws from panel surveys in three countries across two decades to locate residential property generally, and owner-occupation in particular, within a wider literature on the shape of economic inequality in the long run."

"Recycling of spent coffee grounds in construction materials: A review Coffee Beans; Coffea Arabica; Antioxidant Coffee, the second most traded commodity and the second-largest beverage consumed around the world, is responsible for many environmental burdens in the form of spent coffee grounds (SCGs), a by-product from the brewing process of coffee. On the other hand, the carbon footprints and environmental impacts related to construction projects are very concerning. Therefore, researchers and industries have recently tried to move towards green construction practices. This paper presents an overview of utilisation of SCGs, as a promising green biowaste source, in the civil and construction industry. From the literature review conducted, it can be concluded that SCGs have potential use as aggregates in construction materials across a broad range of civil engineering applications. However, limited research and lack of evidence of successful practical applications in the field mean further comprehensive studies in this specific area is required."
"Voice-activated solutions for agile retrospective sessions Scrum; Agile; Project Management Retrospective (retro) sessions are an important part of Agile/Scrum process for software development. In theory, conducting retro sessions each sprint should improve team dynamics and productivity.

"The assessment of graduate sustainability attributes in the workplace: Potential advantages of using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Sustainability in higher education aims to educate learners, as both citizens and future professionals, to build capacity to bring about a more sustainable future. As such, sustainability education can be seen as part of enabling work-ready graduates. Many universities, globally, have begun to embed sustainability capabilities into their degree programs. However, there is a gap in existing methods for assessing graduate application of the associated learning outcomes, post degree-completion. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) has been suggested and applied in the development of an assessment tool to address this limitation. The TPB considers human behaviour is influenced by a number of factors, the measurement of which allows one to understand the likelihood of a person executing a particular behaviour. This paper presents an overview and explanation of how TPB could be applied to graduate sustainability capability assessment, thereby, offering insight into how graduate learning is applied in professional settings."

"Flood Vulnerability Assessment and Mapping: A Case Study for Australia’s Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment Flood Damage; Flooding; Natural Hazards Floods are one of the most destructive natural hazards to which Australia is exposed. The frequency of extreme rainfall events and consequential floods are projected to increase into the future as a result of anthropogenic climate change. This highlights the need for more holistic risk assessments of flood affected regions. Flood risk assessments (FRAs) are used to inform decision makers and stakeholders when creating mitigation and adaptation strategies for at-risk communities. When assessing flood risk, previous FRAs from Australiaâ€™s most flood prone regions were generally focused on the flood hazard itself, and rarely considering flood vulnerability (FV). This study assessed FV in one of Australiaâ€™s most flood prone regionsâ€”the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment, and investigated indicator-based approaches as a proxy method for Australian FV assessment instead of hydrological modelling. Four indicators were selected with the intention of representing environmental and socio-economic characteristics: elevation, degree of slope, index of relative socio-economic disadvantage (IRSD), and hydrologic soil groups (HSGs). It was found that combination of low elevation, low degree of slope, low IRSD score, and very-low infiltration soils resulted in very high levels of vulnerability. FV was shown to be at its highest in the Hawkesbury-Nepean valley flood plain region on the outskirts of Greater Western Sydney, particularly in Blacktown, Penrith, and Liverpool. This actionable risk data which resulted from the final FV index supported the practicality and serviceability of the proxy indicator-based approach. The developed methodology for FV assessment is replicable and has the potential to help inform decision makers of flood-prone communities in Australia, particularly in data scarce areas."

"Design of a 100 MW Solar Power Plant on Wetland in Bangladesh Parabolic; Solar Power Plants; Solar Thermal Energy World-wide a small-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) system is increasingly becoming a popular power source for domestic application. In contrast, large-scale solar power plants are of growing interest for commercial, industrial and community users as an alternative to fossil fuel-driven power plants. Despite the growing interest, scant information on large-scale solar power generation especially in rural and inaccessible locations is available in the public domain. Hence, the primary objective of this study is to design a large-scale (100 MW) solar power plant for wetland areas in Bangladesh. For the 100 MW power plant, a total of 166, 670 solar modules (each of which is 2, 070mm long, 1, 390 mm wide and 45mm thick with 600 W power capacity) have been used. To generate 100 MW electricity (power), around 303 acres (approximately 123 hectares) of the wetland is required keeping the distance of 2.35 m between every two adjacent solar panel mounting rows. A total of six hundred and seventy (670) three-phase grid-tie inverters (GTI) and 40 transformers have been connected to the solar panel. Along with the renewable electricity production, the required wetland (123 hectares) located under the solar panels has been considered for permanent sanctuary to conserve the indigenous fish species. The challenges and risk factors of the 100 MW plant have also been elaborated."

"Innovative immune-based therapies and diagnostics: using nanotechnology for personalized medicine Advances in nanomaterials are expected to enable the design of innovative vaccines, diagnostics and immunotherapies. Their effective
application however, needs a deeper understanding of the person being treated. For example, sex, age and mental health affect the immune system, and vice-versa. Using such insights to personalize immunotherapies will be vital in vulnerable populations, such as cancer patients and the elderly, since many fail to respond to current treatments or vaccines.
We will expand our leadership profile in vaccine nanotechnology, with new vaccines against cancer and malaria. Cross-disciplinary expertise into the effects of sex, aging and brain health on immunity will be deployed to personalize immunotherapies in patients with cancer, and to promote health in the elderly. At the end of the fellowship we will have tested our lead laboratory findings in multiple human trials, validating our new diagnostics, prognostics and personalized immunotherapies."

"The uneven distribution of futurity: Slow emergencies and the event of COVID-19 Biopolitics; Governmentality; Disaster The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic strains conventional temporal imaginaries through which emergencies are typically understood and governed. Rather than a transparent and linear temporality, a smooth transition across the series event/disruptionâ€“responseâ€“post-event recovery, the pandemic moves in fits and starts, blurring the boundary between normalcy and emergency. This distended temporality brings into sharp relief other slow emergencies such as racism, poverty, biodiversity loss, and climate change, which inflect how the pandemic is known and governed as an emergency. In this article, we reflect on COVID-19 responses in two settler colonial societiesâ€”Australia and the United Statesâ€”to consider how distinct styles of pandemic responses in each context resonate and dissonate across the racially uneven distribution of futurity that structures liberal order. In each case, the event of COVID-19 has indeed opened a window that reveals multiple slow emergencies; yet in these and other responses this revelation is not leading to meaningful changes to address underlying forms of structural violence. In Australia and the United States, we see how specific slow emergenciesâ€”human-induced climate change and anti-Black violence in White supremacist societies, respectivelyâ€”become intensified as liberal order recalibrates itself in response to the event of COVID-19."

"Bridging the geospatial gap: Data about space and indigenous knowledge of place Planning; GIS; Cartography Indigenous knowledge of place is not well-served by today's digital geospatial technologies, such as spatial data, maps, spatial databases, and GIS. This paper aims to identify and explore new connections between Indigenous knowledge of place and digital geospatial technologies. Our analysis is structured around three key gaps in past work: (a) the overrepresentation of digital data about space, rather than knowledge of place; (b) a lack of facility to differentiate access to knowledge and enable Indigenous data sovereignty; (c) a lack of facility to support and sustain relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. The paper further identifies and explores recent research topics in the field of geographic information science (GI science) with relevance to addressing these gaps. This includes identifying new serendipitous synergies with previously unconnected research areas, such as research into location privacy, uncertainty, qualitative spatial reasoning, or distributed spatial computing. The conclusions acknowledge that our retrospective approach is unlikely to lead to radical reformulation of geospatial technologies. Nevertheless, we argue that identifying technological opportunities could offer a pragmatic pathway to more rapidly bootstrap new approaches, beyond simply technological â€œfixes.â€."

"Unresolved Complexity in Assessments of Mineral Resource Depletion and Availability Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals Considerations of mineral resource availability and depletion form part of a diverse array of sustainable development-oriented studies, across domains such as resource criticality, life cycle assessment and material flow analysis. Given the multidisciplinary nature of these studies, it is important that a common understanding of the complexity and nuances of mineral supply chains be developed. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of these assessment approaches and expand on several areas that are conceptually difficult to account for in these studies. These include the dynamic nature of relationships between reserves, resources, cut-off grades and ore grades; the ability to account for local economic, social and environmental factors when performing global assessments; and the role that technology improvements play in increasing the availability of economically extractable mineral resources. Advancing knowledge in these areas may further enhance the sophistication and interpretation of studies that assess mineral resource depletion or availability."

We seek to better understand technology usage patterns supporting connectedness and enhancing social participation. Previous research on this area have provided mixed outcomes. In some cases, technology is seen as a fundamental tool in engaging seniors in key social activities. In other cases, technology is portrayed as a source of anxiety and fear. This project expects to generate novel insights for future research in the area of consumer socialisation by investigating experiences of isolation and connectedness, relationship with different forms of technology, and the consequence of interactions with technology within collaborative networks of people. Expected outcomes of this project will assist in reducing social isolation, thus improving health and well-being. These outcomes include proposed strategies for constructive engagement of technological solutions to combat isolation in older Australians"

"A fresh look at contemporary perspectives on urban housing affordability Housing Affordability; Costs And Cost Analysis; Mortgages The literature on housing affordability has grown rapidly since Hulchanski [1995, p. 489. The concept of housing affordability: six contemporary uses of the housing expenditure-to-income ratio. Housing Studies, 10(4), 471â€“491] declared that housing researchers should avoid using the term since it is not a robust concept and measurement often lacks validity. In the ensuing 24 years, however, scholars have continued to debate the definition and measurement of housing affordability as well as the prevalence and type of â€˜housing affordability problemsâ€™ in various countries. This paper is a think piece which takes a fresh look at housing affordability as a concept which has persisted despite considerable contestation and scepticism about its use. It provides a critical and multi-disciplinary assessment of housing affordability starting with early conceptualization of the nexus between economic principles and social norms about housing and living standards to a reworking of housing affordability in the twenty-first century as an urban issue affecting lower and middle-income households in cities, as a consequence of the financialization of housing and urban restructuring. It argues that the housing affordability concept has been repurposed such that the focus is less on understanding housing expenditures in contributing to poverty and disadvantage within the domain of social policy and more on the urban policy challenges of growing inequities in access to urban resources. The paper highlights the challenges for urban policy in adopting and adapting rather than rejecting a multi-dimensional concept of housing affordability and consequently the importance of new ways of measuring urban housing affordability."

"Nanofiltration for arsenic removal: Challenges, recent developments, and perspectives Arsenic Acid; Arsenous Acid Derivative; Wastewater Treatment Arsenic (As) removal is of major significance because inorganic arsenic is highly toxic to all life forms, is a confirmed carcinogen, and is of significant environmental concern. As contamination in drinking water alone threatens more than 150 million people all over the world. Therefore, several conventional methods such as oxidation, coagulation, adsorption, etc., have been implemented for As removal, but due to their cost-maintenance limitations; there is a drive for advanced, low cost nanofiltration membrane-based technology. Thus, in order to address the increasing demand of fresh and drinking water, this review focuses on advanced nanofiltration (NF) strategy for As removal to safeguard water security. The review concentrates on different types of NF membranes, membrane fabrication processes, and their mechanism and efficiency of performance for removing As from contaminated water. The article provides an overview of the current status of polymer-, polymer composite-, and polymer nanocomposite-based NF membranes, to assess the status of nanomaterial-facilitated NF membranes and to incite progress in this area. Finally, future perspectives and future trends are highlighted."

"Identification of Abusive Behavior Towards Religious Beliefs and Practices on Social Media Platforms Cyberbullying; Hate Speech; Social Networking The ubiquitous use of social media has enabled many people, including religious scholars and priests, to share their religious views. Unfortunately, exploiting peopleâ€™s religious beliefs and practices, some extremist groups intentionally or unintentionally spread religious hatred among different communities and thus hamper social stability. This paper aims to propose an abusive behavior detection approach to identify hatred, violence, harassment, and extremist expressions against people of any religious belief on social media. For this, first religious posts from social media usersâ€™ activities are captured and then the abusive behaviors are identified through a number of sequential processing steps. In the experiment, Twitter has been chosen as an example of social media for collecting dataset of six major religions in English Twittersphere. In order to show the performance of the proposed approach, five classic classifiers on n-gram TF-IDF model have been used. Besides, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) classifiers on trained embedding and pre-trained GloVe word embedding models have been used. The experimental result showed 85% accuracy in terms of precision. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that will be able to distinguish between hateful and non-hateful contents in other application domains on social media in addition to religious context."
"Formative Assessment Tasks as Indicators of Student Engagement for Predicting At-risk Students in Programming Courses Moodle; Learning Management System; Dashboards Previous studies have proposed many indicators to assess the effect of student engagement in learning and academic achievement but have not yet been clearly articulated. In addition, while student engagement tracking systems have been designed, they rely on the log data but not on performance data. This paper presents results of a non-machine learning model developed using ongoing formative assessment scores as indicators of student engagement. Visualisation of the classification tree results is employed as student engagement indicators for instructors to observe and intervene with students. The results of this study showed that ongoing assessment is related to student engagement and subsequent final programming exam performance and possible to identify students at-risk of failing the final exam. Finally, our study identified students impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. These were students who attended the final programming exam in the semester 2019â€“2020 and who scored well in formative assessments. Based on these results we present a simple student engagement indicator and its potential application as a student progress monitor for early identification of students at risk."
"Developing novel drug delivery strategies to target myeloid reservoirs of HIV in the brain A major barrier to curing HIV is the persistence of the virus in tissue sites such as the brain where anti-HIV drugs have limited ability to penetrate. HIV persistence in the central nervous system (CNS) is thought to contribute to ~50% of people living with HIV (PLWH) developing a form of cognitive impairment and may be related to the poor penetrance of anti-HIV drugs into the CNS. Therefore, new therapies and/or treatment strategies are required to deliver anti-HIV drugs to the brain. In this project we will develop and validate a
novel drug delivery molecule that binds to and directly delivers anti-HIV drugs to HIV-infected cells in the brain. Targeted drug delivery to the brain may improve drug efficacy, reduce risk of drug toxicity and reduce the role of HIV in driving neurocognitive disorders, thus improving outcomes for PLWH."

"Household expenditure and child health in Vietnam: Analysis of longitudinal data Infant Health; War Exposure; Child Health While the relationship between socioeconomic status and child health has been studied extensively in developed countries, evidence is limited for developing countries. This study makes an important contribution by examining the relationship between child health and household socioeconomic status in Vietnam, using household expenditure as an alternative measure. This also allows us to explore the mechanisms via which income affects child health, in which household consumption arguably plays a crucial role. We employ different measures of health that allow us to examine both long-run and short-run effects, and two alternative instrumental variables, the unemployment rate and rainfall deviation, to address the potential endogeneity of household expenditure. We find evidence of a strong positive impact of household expenditure on child health and the findings are consistent across age groups. Specifically, a 10% increase in expenditure will result in a weight gain of 213-541 g in a typical child. We also explore the effect of a range of exogenous adverse economic shocks on children's health."

"Research on Pear Tree Flowering Period Prediction Method Based on Neural Network Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Phenology; Climate Change Plant phenotype is all physical, physiological, biochemical characteristics and traits that reflect the entire process of plant structural composition, growth and development. Timely phenotypic observation of plants is of great significance in terms of crop safety and environmental sustainability. Aiming at the problems of inaccurate flowering time prediction, time-consuming and waste of energy prediction in traditional pear tree phenotype observation, this paper studies the flowering prediction method of pear tree plants based on PCA-BP neural network. Taking pear tree as the research object, the meteorological observation data of Shijiazhuang Meteorological Station was analyzed by principal component analysis method, then three principal components with large correlation with pear flowering period were obtained. BP neural network model was introduced into the pear tree flowering period prediction and the error was reduced to one day, then."

"Multivariate selection mediated by aridity predicts divergence of drought-resistant traits along natural aridity gradients of an invasive weed Erythranthe Guttata; Germination; Flowering Date Geographical variation in the environment underpins selection for local adaptation and evolutionary divergence among populations. Because many environmental conditions vary across species' ranges, identifying the specific environmental variables underlying local adaptation is profoundly challenging. We tested whether natural selection mediated by aridity predicts clinal divergence among invasive populations of capeweed (Arctotheca calendula) that established and spread across southern Australia during the last two centuries. Using common garden experiments with two environmental treatments (wet and dry) that mimic aridity conditions across capeweedâ€™s invasive range, we estimated clinal divergence and effects of aridity on fitness and multivariate phenotypic selection in populations sampled along aridity gradients in Australia. We show that: (1) capeweed populations have relatively high fitness in aridity environments similar to their sampling locations; (2) the magnitude and direction of selection strongly differs between wet and dry treatments, with drought stress increasing the strength of selection; and (3) differences in directional selection between wet and dry treatments predict patterns of clinal divergence across the aridity gradient, particularly for traits affecting biomass, flowering phenology and putative antioxidant expression. Our results suggest that aridity-mediated selection contributes to trait diversification among invasive capeweed populations, possibly facilitating the expansion of capeweed across southern Australia."

"The impact of terrestrial protected areas on vegetation extent and condition: A systematic review protocol Systematic Review; Collating; Conservation Management Background: Establishing protected areas is a key approach to protecting nature. However, protected areas are often biased towards remote and less productive lands. It is important to evaluate the impacts protected areas have had, or in other words, what changes in outcomes of interest are attributable to protected areas. Studies that evaluate the impact of protected areas on vegetation - the state and processes that support biodiversity - are scarce and published in a range of disciplines. This systematic review will scope, identify, and synthesize studies that quantitatively measure the impact of protected areas on vegetation extent and condition. The findings will be useful for researchers and policy makers and provide important knowledge for setting post 2020 targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity. This review will also identify research gaps in the current evidence base and provide direction for future research. Methods: This review follows the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence guidelines for evidence synthesis and complies with the ROSES (RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Synthesis) reporting framework. We will use a comprehensive search strategy developed through several rounds of scoping review to cover databases; Web of Science, Scopus and CAB Abstracts, 16 organizational websites, google scholar and existing review documents. Our search terms and strategies aim to find impact evaluation studies (both peer-reviewed and grey literature) in English from protected areas globally. The search results will be screened at title, abstract, and then full text by two independent reviewers. A quality appraisal of evidence will be conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) risk of bias tool. Review results will be presented in the form of narrative synthesis, as well as in meta-analysis form, where data quality and amount allow."

"The future of the management of projects in the 2030s Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore recent literature on the impact of changes in the workplace environment and projected trends through to the year 2030. This allows the authors to identify and discuss what key trends are changing the nature of project organising work. The authors aim to identify what knowledge and which skills, attributes and experiences will be most likely valued and needed in 2030. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is essentially a reflective review and is explorative in nature. The authors focus on several recent reports published in the UK and Australia that discuss the way that the future workforce will adapt and prepare for radical changes in the workplace environment. The authors focus on project organising work and the changing workplace knowledge, skills, attributes and experience (KSAE) needs of those working in project teams in 2030 and beyond. The authors draw upon existing KSAE literature including findings from a study undertaken into the KSAEs of project alliance managers working in a highly collaborative form of project delivery. Findings: The analysis suggests that there is good and bad news about project workers prospects in 2030. The good news is that for those working in non-routine roles their work will be more interesting and rewarding than is the case for today. The bad news is that for workers in routine work roles, they will be replaced by advanced digital technology. Research limitations/implications: Few, if any, papers published in the project organising literature speculate about what this discipline may look like or what KSAEs will be valued and needed. Practical implications: This paper opens up a debate about how project management/project organising work will be undertaken in future and what skills and expertise will be required. It also prompts project managers to think about how they will craft their careers in 2030 in response to expected work environment demands. This will have professional and learning implications. Social implications: The issue of the future workplace environment is highly relevant to the social context. Originality/value: This paper is about a projected future some 12 years onward from today. It bridges a gap in any future debate about how project organising jobs may change and how they will be delivered in the 2030s."

"Recent Advances in the Theory and Application of Nanofiltration: a Review Nanofiltration Membranes; Thin Film Composite Membranes; Membrane Water is the material basis for living organisms and one of the primary resources to maintain the sustainable development of the earthâ€™s ecological environment. As a water purification method, nanofiltration (NF) separation technology has been widely considered by researchers in recent years. However, most of the studies on NF in the literature focus on membrane modification, and there are only a few reviews available. In this paper, the latest research progress of NF is reviewed, and the processes of NF membrane preparation using phase inversion, layer by layer, and interfacial polymerization are described. Polymer materials used for NF membrane preparation are reviewed and the main types of nanofillers to generate thin film nanocomposite membranes, including metal organic frameworks, boron nitride, Ti3C2TX, graphene oxide, SiO2, and iron oxide are discussed. Membrane fouling is inevitable during NF operation and this paper analyzes the mechanisms of fouling and summarizes key pretreatment and cleaning methods required to remediate the long-term effects of cake layer formation. The steric hindrance effect, Donnan effect, and dielectric exclusion are analyzed, and some common characterization methods are summarized. The practical applications of NF are briefly introduced including groundwater, pharmaceutical wastewater, and textile wastewater treatment. Finally, the shortcomings and prospects of the existing research progress are put forward."

"Critical evaluation of 'ageing in place' in redeveloped public rental housing estates in Hong Kong Residential Satisfaction; Public Housing; Nigeria The tremendous growth in the ageing population over the past two decades has compelled the Hong Kong government to reformulate its housing policy by redeveloping and incorporating certain age-friendly housing design elements and facilities into the public housing schemes built in the post-war period. This research investigates whether these introduced design elements and facilities satisfy the numerous special needs of the seniors in line with the concept of 'ageing in place'. Data were collected from 224 seniors through a comprehensive questionnaire survey in four large-scale redeveloped public rental housing estates. Using three designated built environment dimensions, namely micro, meso and macro, the results revealed that senior tenants were generally satisfied with the present living environments (in all the three scales) in the estates. At the micro-scale, seniors were satisfied with the level of privacy and sense of autonomy derived from the present design features in their homes. For the meso-scale, the study revealed that the seniors were particularly satisfied with the design elements such as convenient transportation and accessibility, including convenient walkways. At the macro-scale, the community care service is deemed important for seniors' wellbeing. However, more attention is needed on safety measures in interior and shower areas, public seating in common areas and provision of sufficient community care services. This study provides insights for policy makers and development authorities on elderly housing provision ."
"Producing fit-for-purpose water and recovering resources from various sources: An overview Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production Natural resources, except wind power and solar energy, are depleting, and therefore it is essential to develop and implement best management practices wherever possible. With respect to water, integrated water management is essential to preserve the fresh water for many generations to come. Producing fit-for-purpose water from various sources such as rainwater, wastewater, seawater/brackish water, and stormwater will contribute greatly to conserve the fresh water. By looking at a few wastewater streams, such as domestic wastewater and wastewaters from industries such as textile, aquaculture, mining, meat processing, carwash, and agriculture, generated all over the world informs us that quantifying them and characterizing their qualities are important to understand many aspects. The increase or decrease in consumption and technologies implemented (or need to be implemented) for water and energy savings, recovery of energy and resources from concentrates and other wastes (such as wastewater sludge, agricultural and food wastes) to reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover materials and energy will give clear direction that should be taken in research and development and implementation of technologies for sustainable living."

"Tuning the sub-processes in laser reduction of graphene oxide by adjusting the power and scanning speed of laser Graphene Oxide; Nanofiltration Membranes; Graphite Laser reduction of graphene oxide is a promising technology for manufacturing advanced devices such as supercapacitors, sensors and transistors, owing to its distinctive advantages in selective and localized GO reduction, direct micro-nanoscale patterning, and no requirement for chemicals. However, the fundamental mechanism underlying the laser induced reduction is still not well understood. In this paper, we demonstrate that by adjusting the power and scanning speed of a 780 nm femtosecond laser, not only can one distinguish, but also effectively tune, two coexisting sub-processes during the laser reduction, namely the direct conversion from sp3 to sp2 carbon and removal of oxygen functional groups. Different oxygen containing groups demonstrate varied degrees of reduction when the power of the laser was varied. Our study provides solid and direct evidence for the coexistence of two sub-processes in the laser induced reduction of graphene oxide, which is essential for both mechanistic understanding and practical adoption of this technique in real word applications."

"Social Position and Gender Perspectives of eLearning Systems: A Study of Social Sustainability Green Computing; IT Adoption; Sustainable Development The use of information and communication technologies has an increasing impact on our everyday life. The large impact of software engineering on society also means that sociocultural factors are becoming crucial for software systems. Gender and cultural diversity have a significant effect on software development, the sustainability of the software and on the society where the software is used. Thus, these diversity aspects should be analysed while developing a software system. This chapter presents an empirical study that investigates the social position of learner and instructor, gender and cultural differences in needs and use of system features. Our focus is on eLearning systems used in Australia and Saudi Arabia. The results of the study might also be expanded to other application domains such as eHealth and eGovernment. To explore the differences, we applied a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to data collected from 174 participants. The results demonstrated that social position, gender and cultural diversity have significant impacts on usersâ€™ needs and preferences."

"Spatiotemporal variations of DOM components in the Kushiro River impacted by a wetland Fluorescence; Parallel Factor Analysis; Aromaticity Dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been recognized as a serious water quality problem in natural water bodies receiving pollution loads from point and nonpoint sources. The present study investigates the spatiotemporal variability of DOM composition in the Kushiro River and its tributaries (Eastern Hokkaido, Japan) impacted by the Kushiro wetland. Water samples were collected in the wet and dry seasons from several locations of the river and analyzed for DOM characteristics by UVâ€“visible and excitationâ€“emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy techniques and by developing water quality index. Rather than the spatial effect, significant seasonal impacts on DOM pollution in the Kushiro River were observed. Overall concentrations of DOM decreased during the dry season. The increase of specific ultraviolet absorbance in the dry season indicated an increasing trend of humification, aromaticity and molecular weight of DOM. Five fluorescent peaks, including peaks A, C, M, B, and T were predicted by EEM spectra. Peaks A and C were found to be the most dominating peaks in both the seasons and indicated enrichment of humic-like matters in river water. The intensities of poly-aromatic humic substances as well as DOM components of microbial origin increase in the wet season and proteins like autochthonous DOM increase during the dry season. The study recognized the contribution of freshly produced DOM component by the decomposition of wetland plants in wet season and effect of snowfall in the dry season. Analysis of three fluorescence indices revealed that the river water primarily contains terrestrially dominated DOM. A significant impact of the adjacent WWTPs and wetland to the river water DOM were also observed. The water quality index of river water DOM showed low to medium levels of DOM pollution in the Kushiro River."
"Unsustainability at the crossroads of climate change and air pollution sciences: implications for sustainable development and the scholarship of sustainability Indonesia; Swamp Forest; Biomass Burning Release of carbonaceous aerosols â€“ comprising black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) â€“ from biomass burning into the atmosphere is dependent on the burning conditions as to the resultant relative abundances of the emitted BC and OC. This provides a way of managing biomass burning in terms of manipulating the types of emitted aerosol. The carbonaceous aerosols are concerned in different ways in different scientific fields. The BC and OC exert complex implications for (a) radiative forcing in climate change science but (b) public health concern in air pollution science. Referring to these complex implications, a case of sustainability is constructed, which is being unsustainably dealt with at the crossroads of the sciences. This reveals an inadequacy of the reductionist mode of enquiry, necessitating a new mode with unique epistemological orientation for the scholarship of sustainability. The necessity of integration of perspectives that are currently segregated for this sustainability issue and the implications for sustainable development are elucidated.

Influential node ranking in social networks based on neighborhood diversity Betweenness; Spreaders; Complex Network Social networks have significant role in distribution of ideas and advertisement. Discovering the most influential nodes has been a hot topic in the field of social networks analysis and mining. This manuscript proposes novel algorithms for this purpose based on neighborhood diversity. We introduce two new influential node ranking algorithms that use diversity of the neighbors of each node in order to obtain its ranking value. They are applied on a number of real-world networks and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. Our experimental results reveal effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
"Recycled plastic as bitumen modifier: The role of recycled linear low-density polyethylene in the modification of physical, chemical and rheological properties of bitumen Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens The integration of various polymers in bitumen is common practice to reduce its thermal susceptibility. Nowadays, recycled materials are re-purposed in roads to improve the overall pavement performance and durability. Specifically, the use of soft plastics has been increasingly looked after by local governments and road authorities to possibly limit landfill, hence helping with the waste management issues experienced by many countries. This study evaluates the use of a very common and largely available soft plastic - recycled linear low-density polyethylene (R-LLDPE) - for modification of bitumen. To assess its applicability in the road sector, the base bitumen and R-LLDPE modified bitumen blends were compared through physical, chemical, rheological and thermal evaluation. It was observed that due the addition of high concentrations of R-LLDPE the viscosity and softening point were increased from 0.62 Pa s and 44.1 Â°C up to 5.75 Pa s and 122.3 Â°C, respectively, whereas the penetration value decreased from 59.3 to 14.3 (0.1 mm). A progressive increase in viscosity with increasing concentration of R-LLDPE indicates substantial reduction in workability due to the greater polymer-dominant phase. An increase in the intensities of peaks and the absence of new peaks during Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis confirms the successful blending of the recycled polymer into the bitumen matrix. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the modified bitumen had less evaporation and higher thermal stability than base bitumen. The rheological evaluation highlighted how the R-LLDPE addition significantly affected the thermo-susceptibility of the bitumen and improved the resistance to permanent deformation at high temperature and elastic recovery. Based on the overall findings of this study, it can be stated that R-LLDPE â€“ if dosed correctly and sourced from homogeneous sources â€“ can enhance the overall bitumen performance without significant drawbacks. In particular, 3% R-LLDPE is considered a suitable modification for most environmental conditions, whereas 6% R-LLDPE is only ideal for tropical climates. Higher dosage is not recommended."

"Flexibility versus certainty: The experience of mandating a building sustainability index to deliver thermally comfortable homes Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Globally, building energy regulation has been an effective policy instrument for reducing energy use and carbon emissions. In Australia, the majority of regions address building performance through the National Construction Code. However, in 2004 the New South Wales government introduced a planning instrument called the â€˜Building Sustainability Indexâ€™, known as BASIX. Until now there has been limited investigation of this sustainability index approach compared with addressing issues individually through building standards. This paper presents analysis of 94,648 building energy assessments in New South Wales and 190,286 from other Australian states to explore the impact of BASIX. The results show that the building code process delivers greater certainty and higher performance than through the sustainability index. The analysis shows that 58% of homes that pass BASIX would fail the National Construction Code for thermal comfort, and that the process of improving performance through the index is more cumbersome and slower than through individual building standards. Given the need to progressively increase house energy standards, governments should be seeking both certainty and higher performance outcomes. Failure to deliver community expected minimum performance risks locking in poor performance for long-life assets, and condemning a generation of households to unnecessarily higher energy bills."

"Amorphous nano morin outperforms native molecule in anticancer activity and oral bioavailability Drugs; Hydroxypropylcellulose; Itraconazole In the past decade, naturally occurring phytoconstituents have emerged as potential therapeutic agents and alternative to synthetic drugs. However, efficient delivery of hydrophobic phytoconstituents into the body with desired therapeutic efficacy is a key challenge for the pharmaceutical industries due to their insolubility in water and low oral bioavailability. Nanosuspension formulations have shown promises to improve the delivery of the hydrophobic molecules with simultaneously avoiding the drawbacks like carrier toxicity and scale-up issues of other nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems. In this study, we have used morin hydrate (MH), a flavonol, and developed MH nanosuspension formulation (MHNS) to improve its poor physiochemical properties and low oral bioavailability. Different stabilizers with varying concentrations were investigated for preparing nanosuspension. MHNS was characterized by DLS, TEM, FTIR, DSC, powder XRD and was evaluated for its solubility, dissolution, partition coefficient, in-vitro anticancer activity and pharmacokinetics in rats. The optimized nanosuspension formulation, with a size of <100 nm, is capable of increasing aqueous solubility, dissolution rate, and oral bioavailability of MH. Moreover, the therapeutic efficacy, in terms of cytotoxicity to human lung cancer cells, of MH was also increased after formulating into nanosuspension form."

"Big4 responses to the COVID-19 crisis: an examination of Bauman's moral impulse Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: The paper offers insights on the response of a Big4 firm to the COVID-19 crisis vis-Ã -vis moral considerations. More specifically, the authors draw on Bauman's (1990) â€œmoral impulseâ€ to explore how the interrelated tactics of distancing, effacement of the face and reduction of people to traits tend to weaken moral considerations and negatively influences decisions and actions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt a qualitative approach that involves an interpretive textual analysis of the COVID-19 responses of a Big 4 accounting firm. Their study uses two vignettes in which they problematise aspects of the actions and ethico-social contribution of a Big4 firm in the heat of a global pandemic. Findings: The findings reveal examples of effacement of the human face (depersonalization/dehumanization) and reduction of persons to traits, as well as excessive distancing between the â€œdoingâ€ actors and those individuals who bear the consequences of those actions. Revealing an opportunity lost, the authorsâ€™ vignettes indicate that the reduction to traits tactics led to dissembling and dehumanizing employees into resources that perform tasks that are â€œvalue-addâ€ for the organisation, consonant with neoliberal ideologies. Research limitations/implications: The common limitations of qualitative approach apply to the current study for generalisability. The authors also rely heavily on publicly available information given the time frame they were faced with and their chosen research approach. Social implications: Drawing on accounting delineation debates, the paper calls for societal dialogues for reshaping the â€œofficialâ€ accounting of events. Originality/value: The authors elaborate moral impulse through the interrelated tactics of distancing, effacement of the face and reduction to traits, during a crisis. Their study mobilises a moral evaluation through which they uncover documented responses by a Big4 firm during the COVID-19 crisis. The study shows how the norms of human action have been systematically cut off from the original moral habitat and subordinated, and evaluated according, to business standards."

"Identifying Grassroots Opportunities and Barriers to mHealth Design for HIV/AIDS Using a Communicative Ecologies Framework Text Messaging; E-Health; Mobile Phone The aim of this qualitative study was to test how social and cultural research methods can be used to anticipate opportunities and barriers to the use of consumer mobile devices by community health workers (CHWs) for HIV/AIDS prevention, testing and treatment. An exploratory study was conducted with CHWs (n = 19) at the regional capitals of Denpasar and Makassar in Indonesia in order to build to a clearer picture of how the participants have integrated personal mobile handsets into their daily professional and personal routine. A communicative ecologies framework was applied to the research design which included a range of qualitative methods including in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and communicative ecology mapping. Our main findings revealed that there was no bottom-up impetus for the introduction of a formal mHealth system to support client interactions. Existing client data collection systems were locked into paper-based systems to ensure compatibility with local government and/or funding body administrative systems; hence, mobile device-based data collection would require additional processes by the participants. Boundary issues were reported with regard to out of hours contact by clients. Some CHWs sent SMS medication reminders to clients but the strong preference indicated by all participating CHWs was to meet clients face-to-face in order to build and maintain trust through the in-person counselling process, rather than introduce mobile-mediated interaction."

"Active and passive electro-optical sensors for health assessment in food crops Stripe Rust; Plant Leaves; Puccinia Striiformis In agriculture, early detection of plant stresses is advantageous in preventing crop yield losses. Remote sensors are increasingly being utilized for crop health monitoring, offering non-de-structive, spatialized detection and the quantification of plant diseases at various levels of measure-ment. Advances in sensor technologies have promoted the development of novel techniques for precision agriculture. As in situ techniques are surpassed by multispectral imaging, refinement of hyperspectral imaging and the promising emergence of light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote sensing will define the future of biotic and abiotic plant stress detection, crop yield estimation and product quality. The added value of LIDAR-based systems stems from their greater flexibility in capturing data, high rate of data delivery and suitability for a high level of automation while overcoming the shortcomings of passive systems limited by atmospheric conditions, changes in light, viewing angle and canopy structure. In particular, a multi-sensor systems approach and associated data fusion techniques (i.e., blending LIDAR with existing electro-optical sensors) offer increased accuracy in plant disease detection by focusing on traditional optimal estimation and the adoption of artificial intelligence techniques for spatially and temporally distributed big data. When applied across different platforms (handheld, ground-based, airborne, ground/aerial robotic vehicles or satellites), these electro-optical sensors offer new avenues to predict and react to plant stress and disease. This review examines the key sensor characteristics, platform integration options and data analysis techniques recently proposed in the field of precision agriculture and highlights the key challenges and benefits of each concept towards informing future research in this very important and rapidly growing field."

"Diversity of dinoflagellate assemblages in coastal temperate and offshore tropical waters of Australia Cyst (Resting Stage); Peridiniales; Alexandrium Minutum Background: Dinoflagellates are a ubiquitous and ecologically important component of marine phytoplankton communities, with particularly notable species including those associated with harmful algal blooms (HABs) and those that bioluminesce. High-throughput sequencing offers a novel approach compared to traditional microscopy for determining species assemblages and distributions of dinoflagellates, which are poorly known especially in Australian waters. Results: We assessed the composition of dinoflagellate assemblages in two Australian locations: coastal temperate Port Phillip Bay and offshore tropical waters of Davies Reef (Great Barrier Reef). These locations differ in certain environmental parameters reflecting latitude as well as possible anthropogenic influences. Molecular taxonomic assessment revealed more species than traditional microscopy, and it showed statistically significant differences in dinoflagellate assemblages between locations. Bioluminescent species and known associates of HABs were present at both sites. Dinoflagellates in both areas were mainly represented by the order Gymnodiniales (66%â€”82% of total sequence reads). In the warm waters of Davies Reef, Gymnodiniales were equally represented by the two superclades, Gymnodiniales sensu stricto (33%) and Gyrodinium (34%). In contrast, in cooler waters of Port Phillip Bay, Gymnodiniales was mainly represented by Gyrodinium (82%). In both locations, bioluminescent dinoflagellates represented up to 0.24% of the total sequence reads, with Protoperidinium the most abundant genus. HAB-related species, mainly represented by Gyrodinium, were more abundant in Port Phillip Bay (up to 47%) than at Davies Reef (28%), potentially reflecting anthropogenic influence from highly populated and industrial areas surrounding the bay. The entire assemblage of dinoflagellates, as well as the subsets of HAB and bioluminescent species, were strongly correlated with water quality parameters (R2 = 0.56â€“0.92). Significant predictors differed between the subsets: HAB assemblages were explained by salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and total dissolved solids; whereas, bioluminescent assemblages were explained only by salinity and dissolved oxygen, and had greater variability. Conclusion: High-throughput sequencing and genotyping revealed greater diversity of dinoflagellate assemblages than previously known in both subtropical and temperate Australian waters. Significant correlations of assemblage structure with environmental variables suggest the potential for explaining the distribution and composition of both HAB species and bioluminescent species."

"A classic herbal formula guizhi fuling wan for menopausal hot flushes: From experimental findings to clinical applications Hot Flashes; Menopause; Breast Neoplasms A classic herbal formula Guizhi Fuling Wan (GFW) has been used for managing menopausal hot flushes (MHFs), but the evidence across different study types has not been systematically summarized. This project investigated the clinical effects, phytochemistry, pharmacodynamics, and potential mechanisms of actions of GFW on the causative target proteins potentially driving MHFs. Twenty English and Chinese databases were searched for relevant clinical and experimental studies. A total of 12,988 studies were identified, of which 46 were included. Seven clinical studies demonstrated GFW had no statistically significant changes in the frequency and severity of MHFs; however, it could improve peripheral blood flow in the fingertips, jaw, and toes. Thirty-five studies on phytochemistry identified 169 chemical compounds of GFW. Four experimental studies revealed GFWâ€™s therapeutic effects (e.g., normalize calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) level) and potential target protein/cytokine (estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) with genetic variation, CGRP receptor, and interleukin-8) on MHFs. Therapeutic effects across different study types were inconsistent, possibly due to the dose difference and genotype variety of ESR2 in the human population. Further clinical and experimental studies, as well as biochemical investigation on the mechanisms of actions of GFW, are recommended."
"A living lab study of query amendment in job search Web Search; Information Retrieval; Learning to Rank Errors in formulation of queries made by users can lead to poor search results pages. We performed a living lab study using online A/B testing to measure the degree of improvement achieved with a query amendment technique when applied to a commercial job search engine. Of particular interest in this case study is a clear 'success' signal, namely, the number of job applications lodged by a user as a result of querying the service. A set of 276 queries was identified for amendment in four different categories through the use of word embeddings, with large gains in conversion rates being attained in all four of those categories. Our analysis of query reformulations also provides a better understanding of user satisfaction in the case of problematic queries (ones with fewer results than fill a single page) by observing that users tend to reformulate rewritten queries less."
"Exercise facilities and the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the city of Madrid Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Aims/hypothesis: We aimed to study the association between the availability of exercise facilities and the likelihood of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the adult population of Madrid, Spain. Methods: We analysed the electronic medical records of all 1,270,512 residents of Madrid aged 40â€“75 years in 2017. Exercise facility availability was defined as the count of exercise facilities in a 1000 m street network buffer around each residential building entrance. Poisson regression with standard errors clustered at census tract level was used to assess prevalence ratios of exercise facility availability tertiles and obesity and type 2 diabetes. We also examined stratified results by tertiles of area-level socioeconomic status (SES) and sex. Results: People living in areas with lower availability of exercise facilities had a higher prevalence of obesity (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.22 [95% CI 1.20, 1.25]) and diabetes (PR 1.38 [95% CI 1.34, 1.43]). We observed effect modification by area-level SES (p<0.001), with stronger associations for residents living in low-SES areas and no association for residents living in high-SES areas. Associations with type 2 diabetes were stronger among women compared with men, while associations with obesity were similar by sex. Conclusions/interpretation: People living in areas with low availability of exercise facilities had a higher prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and this association was strongest in low-SES areas and for women. Understanding the potential role of exercise facilities in driving inequities in obesity and type 2 diabetes prevalence may inform interventions to reduce health inequities.

"School–community learning partnerships for sustainability: Recommended best practice and reality Network Governance; Sector; Disaster Response Effective partnerships across different stakeholders are essential to the collaboration required for learning cities to contribute to sustainable development. Through partnerships, formal educational institutions, such as schools and universities, play a vital role in establishing and sustaining learning cities, often by facilitating the meaningful participation of different local community members. The research presented in this article examines the characteristics of effective schoolâ€“ community partnerships in the literature and compares it to the results of a threeyear research study which examined 16 case studies of schoolâ€“community partnerships in the state of Victoria in Australia. Using participatory action research, the researchers identified four approaches to implementing partnerships for sustainability, explored challenges to achieving an idealised partnership, and made recommendations for establishing successful partnership networks. The researchers propose that partnerships be viewed as a dynamic resource rather than merely a transactional arrangement that addresses the identified challenges of time, funding, skills and personnel. Furthermore, the use of â€˜â€˜partnership brokersâ€™â€™, such as local government or non-government organisations, is recommended to expand the current school-centred approach to partnerships. These insights aim to contribute to providing quality education and lifelong learning through partnerships â€“ outcomes crucial for establishing and sustaining learning cities."
"A systematic review of AR/VR in operations and supply chain management: maturity, current trends and future directions Big Data; Business Intelligence; Supply Chain Management Purpose: This research aims to provide systematic insight into the current maturity of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) in operations and supply chain management (OSCM), by analyzing the existing literature, contemporary concepts, data and gaps for future research directions. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses information from existing literature regarding timeline trends, publishers, research design and method, industry engagement, geographic location, active authors and affiliated universities, concentrated topics, theories and maturity in its review. A collection of publishing databases from 1997 to 2021 were explored using the keywords â€œAugmented Reality,â€ â€œVirtual Realityâ€ and â€œOperationsâ€ and/or â€œSupply Chainâ€ in their title and abstract to examine which publications to be included. Based on the search, a total of 164 journal articles were selected, and information on a chain of variables was collected. Findings: There has been a significant publication growth over the past 25 years regarding the adoption of AR/VR in OSCM. Key findings indicate that 52% of the publications were focused on manufacturing, with only 10% of the existing literature using background theories. AR/VR can be observed at the introduction and growth phase and have yet to reach their maturity. Furthermore, there is limited utilization of AR/VR as drivers in facilitating sustainable practices in OSCM by academics and practitioners, albeit a strong promise exists. Finally, the prospective applications of AR/VR toward post-COVID-19 supply chains recovery require special attention. Research limitations/implications: This systematic review is limited to considering only academic articles available from Emerald, Elsevier, Taylor and Francis, Springer, Scopus, JSTOR and EBSCO containing the keyword parameters. Originality/value: The study used a bibliometric review to identify the trends and maturity in the evolution of AR/VR in OSCM. This research provides a better understanding of current research practices and offers directions toward the adoption of AR/VR in OSCM."

"Graduate attribute for minimising environmental harm – Assessing effectiveness in the graduates’ workplaces Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Over recent times concern about the physical environment has fluctuated. Even after the coverage of environment and sustainability issues in the education of many professions, a decline of community concern suggests that the potential for the inclusion of environmental issues in the work of professionals could be limited. This situation raises the question of whether recent graduates have the ability, through their workplaces, to act to minimise environmental harm. To assess this ability, based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour, a survey instrument was developed and tested on a sample of graduates, of an Australian university, associated with the building and construction fields. Results indicated, firstly, that the model provided a valid approach to the assessment of influences on a graduate's behaviour. Secondly, that factors associated with their workplaces are very influential, especially support from their employers and clients. Further, behavioural enablers are especially important influences on behaviour: specifically the resources available to the graduate, workplace support and assistance, and the scope and power associated with the graduate's role. These findings provide insights for the curriculum and pedagogy that is needed if graduates are to enter the workforce and be effective in minimising environmental harm from their professional activities."

"Employment types and subjective wellbeing: Evidence from the english longitudinal survey of ageing Subjective Well-Being; Happiness; Life Satisfaction Using seven waves of the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing (ELSA), this chapter examines the impact of labour market attachments on subjective wellbeing (SWB) and quality of life (QoL), during employment and retirement. The authors show that that permanent employees (as opposed to temporary employees) and self-employed (as opposed to paid employees) report higher levels of SWB and QoL throughout their working lives. They argue that this is because permanent employees and the self-employed become more attached to their jobs due to a perceived stronger job-identity fit. However, in retirement, withdrawal from the labour market represents a loss of this identity. Thus, a significant drop in SWB and QoL is observed for permanent employees and self-employed during retirement."
"Self-Determination theory applied to physical education: A systematic review and meta-analysis Need Satisfaction; Self-Determination Theory; Physical Education In this review we examine the evidence regarding self-determination theory within the school physical education context. We applied a multilevel structural equation modeling approach to meta-analyze data from a systematic review that identified 265 relevant studies. In line with theory, autonomous motivation was positively correlated with adaptive outcomes and negatively correlated with maladaptive outcomes. Introjected regulation was modestly correlated with both adaptive and maladaptive outcomes. External regulation and amotivation both showed negative relationships with adaptive outcomes, and positive relationship with maladaptive outcomes. Also supporting SDT, autonomy, competence, and relatedness satisfactions were strongly correlated with autonomous student motivation, and less strongly, but still positively, correlated with introjected regulation. Weak negative correlations were found between autonomy, competence, and relatedness and external regulation. Amotivation had moderate negative correlations with needs satisfaction. Findings further revealed that teachers more greatly impact classroom experiences of autonomy and competence, whereas relatedness in physical education is associated with both peer and teacher influences."
"Uptake and distribution of nanoparticles by cancer cells There is growing interest in nanoparticle (NP) toxicity due to the promise of nanoparticles
(NPs) for diverse applications in drug delivery, biosensing, biological imaging, gene therapy and
photothermal therapy. While researchers continue to investigate novel medical applications, we still
have a limited understanding of critical nano-bio interactions. In our previous work, human prostate
cancer cells were used to study the uptake and toxicity of gold NPs of different size and shape. In
this study, we plan to take advantage of recent advances in soft X-ray tomography to collect
comprehensive three-dimensional data in order to characterise the interaction of 3 types of NPs with
human prostate cancer cells (PC3). While the experimental feasibility has been shown in recent
papers, we plan to test the limits of the technique by studying 3 types of NPs (gold, silver and
nanodiamond) with size ranges from ~10-200 nm. This will form the basis for an ongoing
experimental program in better understanding NP toxicity.

"Effect of Temperature-Dependent Blood Viscosity on Low-Density Lipoprotein Transport: Numerical Study Atherogenesis; Low Density Lipoprotein; Atherosclerotic Plaques The blood viscosity is correlated with the risk of developing atherosclerotic lesions. The environmental factor can play an important role in altering hemodynamics and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) especially the ambient temperature. The greenhouse gas emission from energy or power production can increase the ambient temperature. This study investigated the effect of temperature-dependent blood viscosity on the LDL transport within the axisymmetric artery with a 40% stenosis blockage via computational fluid dynamics simulation. The results showed that the changing of blood viscosity inducing the change in pressure drop. The penetration locations of the LDL were also shifted which increased the risk of having LDL penetrating into the arterial wall. In addition, the outcome will contribute to the initial development of atherosclerosis modelling."

"Mental Health Impacts of Child Labour: Evidence from Vietnam and India Infant Health; War Exposure; Child Health A number of recent studies have investigated the relationship between child labour and physical health. However, there has been little empirical evidence that child labour affects childrenâ€™s emotional and behavioural development. This study departs from existing literature by examining the mental health impacts of child labour in Vietnam and India, as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The potential endogeneity of child labour is addressed by using rainfall as the instrument. The findings show that children engaged in child labour suffer from mental health issues as measured by peer problems and reduced prosocial behaviour in both countries. There is a significant gender difference in the impact of child labour in India. Finally, doing household chores, an accepted social and cultural work in developing countries is found to be associated with the better mental health of children in Vietnam."
"A multi-objective optimization framework for building-integrated PV envelope design balancing energy and cost Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation The design of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) envelopes involves a large set of envelope-related parameters, PV-related parameters and conflicting performance criteria. Therefore, optimization of BIPV design is crucial and it has become a complex process. Existing BIPV design optimization frameworks lack BIPV product and application type-related variables, and most studies cannot handle large sets of design variables and automatically generate a set of alternative optimal designs. Therefore, an optimization framework has become a major requirement in BIPV envelope design. This study introduces a multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework to optimize life cycle energy (LCE) and life cycle cost (LCC) simultaneously, at the conceptual BIPV envelope design stage, considering different BIPV application types for the selection of appropriate BIPV products and designs. A set of envelope design features, as well as PV-related features such as tilt angle, window-to-wall ratio (WWR), PV placement and PV product type, are included as design variables in the framework. The novelty of this study is that it generates a set of the best BIPV design alternatives based on multiple objectives, PV products and building features. Alternative designs include the best building surface features and the best BIPV product for a given performance criterion. The framework is demonstrated using canopy, roof sheet and cladding BIPV applications and the results incorporate different design solutions for each case study. The results show that MOO is operational for early BIPV design decisions based on technical considerations of energy and cost. Mid-design stage decisions can be guided by these simulated results but are not sufficient to define design decisions. Client subjectivity, taste and preference may heavily impact the feasibility of applying the optimization results, because in some cases, energy optimization is not the overarching goal of the client."

"An Integrated Framework for Privacy-Preserving Based Anomaly Detection for Cyber-Physical Systems Attack; Supervisory Control; Intrusion Detection Protecting Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) is highly important for preserving sensitive information and detecting cyber threats. Developing a robust privacy-preserving anomaly detection method requires physical and network data about the systems, such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), for protecting original data and recognising cyber-attacks. In this paper, a new privacy-preserving anomaly detection framework, so-called PPAD-CPS, is proposed for protecting confidential information and discovering malicious observations in power systems and their network traffic. The framework involves two main modules. First, a data pre-processing module is suggested for filtering and transforming original data into a new format that achieves the target of privacy preservation. Second, an anomaly detection module is suggested using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Kalman Filter (KF) for precisely estimating the posterior probabilities of legitimate and anomalous events. The performance of the PPAD-CPS framework is assessed using two public datasets, namely the Power System and UNSW-NB15 dataset. The experimental results show that the framework is more effective than four recent techniques for obtaining high privacy levels. Moreover, the framework outperforms seven peer anomaly detection techniques in terms of detection rate, false positive rate, and computational time."
"Backlighting the European Indium Recycling Potentials Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals With increased understanding of the effects of human activities on the environment and added awareness of the increasing societal value of natural resources, researchers have begun to focus on the characterization of elemental cycles. Indium has captured significant attention due to the potential for supply shortages and nonexistent recycling at end of life. Such a combination of potentially critical features is magnified for countries that depend on imports of indium, notably many European countries. With the aims of analyzing the dynamics of material flows and of estimating the magnitude of secondary indium sources available for recycling, the anthropogenic indium cycle in Europe has been investigated by material flow analysis. The results showed that the region is a major consumer of finished goods containing indium, and the cumulative addition of indium in urban mines was estimated at about 500 tonnes of indium. We discuss these results from the perspective of closing the metal cycle in the region. Securing access to critical raw materials is a priority for Europe, but the preference for recycling metal urban mines risks to remain only theoretical for indium unless innovations in waste collection and processing unlock the development of technologies that are economically feasible and environmentally sustainable."

"The politics of maladaptation Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience An emerging component of the adaptation discourse, embracing theory, practice and review, is that of the negative assessment of adaptation, namely, maladaptation. Political theories and concepts have been applied as one of these assessment tools, giving rise to a political critique of maladaptation. Such a critique contrasts with the more conventional scientific and technical assessments of adaptation policies, programs and practices. Key political themes in studies of mal-adaptation include resource management and allocations, decision making processes, equity and fairness, gender, power and influence, and Nature and ecology. Within the scholarship on the politics of maladaptation, overlapping frameworks can be identified. Critiques of adaptation have been applied to the preconditions of adaptation, adaptation decision making processes and institutions, and to adaptation outcomes. There are a number of conceptual challenges in undertaking political analyses of adaptation. In this article, we outline the origins of the adaptation and maladaptation concepts, we describe the key political issues, we identify the application of politics in the maladapta-tion discourse and identify the major political perspectives. Finally, we draw conclusions on the state of the maladaptation discourse."
"Review of drivers and threats to coastal groundwater quality in China Nutrients; Submarines; Radon With rapid socio-economic development, China's coastal areas are among the fastest growing and most economically dynamic regions in the world. Under the influence of climate change and human activities, protecting the quality of coastal groundwater has emerged as one of the key environmental and resource management issues for these areas. This paper reviews (for the first time) groundwater quality data for the coastal basins of China, where over 600 million people live, focussing on key inorganic indicators/pollutants; groundwater salinity, nitrate, fluoride, and arsenic. These pollutants present major water quality issues and are also valuable as indicators of wider processes and influences impacting coastal groundwater quality â€“ e.g. saltwater intrusion, agricultural pollution and release of geo-genic contaminants. We discuss the major drivers causing water quality problems in different regions and assess future trajectories and challenges for controlling changes in coastal groundwater quality in China. Multiple processes, including modern and palaeo seawater/brine migration, groundwater pumping for agricultural irrigation, pollution from agrochemical application, rapid development of aquaculture, urban growth, and water transfer projects, may all be responsible (to different degrees) for changes observed in coastal groundwater quality, and associated long-term health and ecological effects. We discuss implications for sustainable coastal aquifer management in China, arguing that groundwater monitoring and contamination control measures require urgent improvement. The evolution and treatment of coastal groundwater quality problems in China will serve as an important warning and example for other countries facing similar pressures, due to climate change, coastal development, and intensification of anthropogenic activity in coming decades."
"Urban–rural disparity of social vulnerability to natural hazards in Australia Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Assessing vulnerability to natural hazards is at the heart of hazard risk reduction. However, many countries such as Australia lack measuring systems to quantity vulnerability for hazard risk evaluation. Drawing on 41 indicators from multiple data sources at the finest spatial unit of the Australian census, we re-forged the Cutterâ€™s classic vulnerability measuring framework by involving the â€˜4Dâ€™ quantification of built environment (diversity, design, density and distance), and constructed the first nationwide fine-grained measures of vulnerability for urban and rural locales, respectively. Our measures of vulnerability include five themesâ€”(1) socioeconomic status; (2) demographics and disability; (3) minority and languages; (4) housing characteristics; and (5) built environmentâ€”that were further used to assess the inequality of vulnerability to three widely affected natural hazards in Australia (wildfires, floods, and earthquakes). We found the inequality of vulnerability in the affected areas of the three hazards in eight capital cities are more significant than that of their rural counterparts. The most vulnerable areas in capital cities were peri-urban locales which must be prioritised for hazard adaptation. Our findings contribute to the risk profiling and sustainable urbanâ€“rural development in Australia, and the broad understanding of place-based risk reduction in South Hemisphere."

"Building capacity for a user‐centred integrated early warning system for drought in Papua New Guinea Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China Drought has significant impacts on the agricultural productivity and wellâ€being of Pacific Island communities. In this study, a userâ€centred integrated early warning system (Iâ€EWS) for drought was investigated for Papua New Guinea (PNG). The Iâ€EWS combines satellite products (Standardised Precipitation Index and Vegetation Health Index) with seasonal probabilistic forecasting outputs (chance of exceeding median rainfall). Internationally accepted drought thresholds for each of these inputs are conditionally combined to trigger three drought early warning stagesâ€” â€DROUGHT WATCHâ€, â€œDROUGHT ALERTâ€ and â€œDROUGHT EMERGENCYâ€. The developed Iâ€ EWS for drought was used to examine the evolution of a strong El NiÃ±oâ€induced drought event in 2015 as well as a weaker La NiÃ±aâ€induced dry period in 2020. Examining the evolution of drought early warnings at a provincial level, it was found that tailored warning lead times of 3â€“5 months could have been possible for several impacted PNG provinces. These lead times would enable in-creasingly proactive drought responses with the potential for prioritised allocation of funds at a provincial level. The methodology utilised within this study uses inputs that are openly and freely available globally which indicates promising potential for adaptation of the developed userâ€centred Iâ€EWS in other Pacific Island Countries that are vulnerable to drought."

"Life cycle costing of municipal food waste management systems: The effect of environmental externalities and transfer costs using local government case studies Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste Municipal food waste is of growing interest worldwide as governments strive to reduce wastesâ€™ environmental impact. For local governments responsible for waste collection, treatment and disposal; finding an affordable management and treatment solution with the smallest impact on the environment is paramount. This paper introduces a life cycle costing tool, incorporating both an Environmental LCC and Societal LCC to provide decision support to local government. The tool was tested on two case study waste catchments; comparing seven unique food waste management systems. Results indicated that food waste anaerobic digestion or co-digestion, shown to have smaller environmental impacts, can be implemented with marginal increase (1.7% to 11.6%) in overall cost. Moreover, with efficiencies food waste anaerobic digestion systems can demonstrate the same cost as business-as-usual. Composting systems were also revealed to have consistently lower costs per household across case studies than business-as-usual, although environmental impacts were generally higher than digestion systems. Further analysis determined the required rate of policy incentives (i.e. landfill levy, electricity tariffs and carbon credits) to promote various alternative food waste management systems."

"Recovery and reuse of alginate in an immobilized algae reactor Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water The use of microalgae for nutrients removal from wastewater has attracted more attention in recent years. More specifically, immobilized systems where algae cells are entrapped in beads in a matrix of a polysaccharide such as alginate have shown a great potential for nutrients removal from wastewater to low levels with reduced retention times and hence smaller footprint. However, a significant operational cost in the up-scaling of alginate-immobilized algae reactors will be the gelling agent alginate. To reduce expenditure of this consumable a proof-of-concept is given for an alginate recycling method using sodium citrate as a dissolving agent. Using algae beads made from virgin and recycled alginate yielded comparable removal rates for both phosphorus and nitrogen compounds from wastewater. At labscale, an alginate recovery of approximately 70% can be achieved which would result in a net operational cost reduction of about 60%."

"Gold Coast smart city strategy: Informed by local planning priorities and international smart city best practices Smart Cities; Big Data; Internet of Things This paper takes an applied approach to propose a smart city strategy informed by local planning priorities and international best practices. In doing so, it focuses on Gold Coast - a midsized Coastal City in Australia - which has been part of IBM's smarter cities challenge, and open and agile smart cities network. In this paper, local planning context and priorities in relation to smart cities are investigated, and benchmarked against best practice smart city initiatives from around the world. The result is a strategic smart city framework around organisational and operational capital, economic and financial capital, human and social capital, infrastructure and physical capital. The approach taken, and the lessons learned are applicable to other cities interested in taking a strategic approach towards the fast growing concept of smart cities."

"‘Grey’ exclusions matter: mapping illegal exclusionary practices and the implications for children with disabilities in England and Australia Inclusive Education; Special Educational Needs; Psychological Practice This paper provides an outline of, and rationale for, an international research project that will identify commonalities and disparities in illegal school exclusionary practices in Australia and England. The aims here are to situate such practices within a global context and to map the events and processes through which children and young people, particularly those with â€˜specialâ€™ educational needs and disabilities, are removed from school in Australia and England. The research we advocate is premised on evidence that inequitable and illegal exclusionary practices are endemic in education systems globally; hence, â€˜pushout syndromeâ€™ in the USA, â€˜off rollingâ€™ in England, facilitated â€˜dropoutâ€™ in Italy and â€˜grey exclusionsâ€™ in Australia. The authors argue that the repeated commissioning of research by national governments and school inspectorates, intended to accurately ascertain the scale of this problem and its impact on the life trajectories of the excluded, serves to defer meaningful action to prevent its occurrence. School exclusion, whether legal or illegal, can be conceptualized as a process rather than an event, and this paper discusses a descriptive continuum through which exclusionary practices in Australia and England can be mapped An experiential continuum is proposed that facilitates a thematic mapping of contributory factors, identified from a relevant literature, as a preliminary analytical framework for future research."

"The role of strategic interactions in risk-taking behavior: A study from asset growth perspective Bank Efficiency; Banking Industry; Banking This study uses panel data on Vietnamese commercial banks from 2008 to 2018 in order to investigate the role of strategic interactions in determining bank risk-taking behavior by considering bank asset growth. The results suggest that aggressive competition is less favorable for banks striving for stability and that a high value of competitive strategy measure (as a proxy for strategic interactions) encourages risk-taking incentives. We also find that the distributional effects of strategic interaction on bank risk-taking because of asset growth reveal that the uncertainty in strategic-interaction-driven profits diminishes in banks with higher growth. This finding is consistent with the idea that when competition becomes more aggressive, bank restructuring should focus on increasing total assets by merging and acquiring small- and medium-sized banks to stabilize the banking sector. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that banks with low leverage or under regulatory pressure engage in more risk-taking. Therefore, policymakers may not implement a tighter capital requirement that contributes to a heightened level of risk. The results are robust to alternative measures of risk-taking and monetary policy stance as well as different econometric specifications."

"The science and politics of climate risk assessment in Australia's Murray Darling Basin Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Climate change has many disruptive consequences, particularly in large river basins experiencing drying trends and declining water availability. With pressure for more adaptive policies, understanding how institutions governing water are adapting to climate risks has broad international relevance. This paper examines the challenges of climate risk assessments in Australia's Murray Darling Basin, an economically and culturally important basin where national legislation mandates a Basin Plan based on the best available science. However, despite repeated scientific warnings about a drying climate, the current Basin Plan does not reduce estimates of water resources available, and its climate risk management relies on a bricolage of policy mechanisms, which appear insufficient for the magnitude of predicted changes. This paper outlines the findings of original research exploring why this occurred. It draws on interviews with 30 senior public policy professionals and researchers with deep experience in climate and water policy. The interview data indicate that minimising political risks were the principal reasons for abandoning proposed reductions in entitlements and for relying on historical averages for estimating water availability. As the reform process evolved, decisions about water-planning techniques became increasingly politicised, and the adoption of explicit climate adaptation measures became problematic. As a result, the Basin Plan neither reflects the broad scientific consensus about climate change nor makes specific allowances for declining water availability. Climate risks are downplayed while concerns about levels of scientific uncertainties appear overstated. Importantly, lessons emerge from this examination that could contribute to the revisions of the Plan, scheduled for 2026. More generally, the research finds that proactive climate adaptation policies for large river basins require sustained and well-designed institutional reforms, particularly the adoption of legally prescribed procedures for utilising science - and accounting for its use - in controversial environmental reforms."

"Improving the information availability and accessibility of antenatal measurements to ensure safe delivery: A research-based policy recommendation to reduce neonatal mortality in indonesia Small For Gestational Age; Pregnancy; Birth Weight Purpose: Assessing the risks and preventable causes of maternal and neonatal mortality requires the availability of good-quality antenatal information. In Indonesia, however, access to reliable information on pregnancy-related results remains challenging. This research has proposed a research-based policy recommendation to improve availability and accessibility to vital information on antenatal examinations. Patients and Methods: Descriptive statistics were used to characterize midwivesâ€™ capabilities in routinely gathering and recording antenatal information during pregnancy. The investigation was carried out among 19 midwives in South Kalimantan, Indonesia, from April 2016 to October 2017. Antenatal data on 4946 women (retrospective study) and 381 women (prospective study) have been accessed through a scientific andtechnicaltrainingprogram. Results: To date, lack of timely access to antenatal information has hampered the process of reducing neonatal mortality in Indonesia. The post-training statistical analysis showed that the training has significantly improved midwivesâ€™ scientific knowledge and technical abilities in providing more reliable data on antenatal measurements. Conclusion: Consistent scientific and technical training among midwives is required to update their knowledge and skills, particularly those relating to documenting the results of antenatal examinations at different stages of pregnancy and using that information to assess potential risks and identify necessary interventions. This should also be followed by routine monitoring on the quality of collected antenatal data. This can be one of the enabling actions to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals target in reducing neonatal mortality in Indonesia."

"In situ control of tempered martensite during laser cladding repair of aero-grade 300M steel using AISI 420 stainless steel powder Laser Cladding; Inconel (Trademark); Laser The aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of delay time between the clad tracks on the microstructure hardness evolution. AISI 420 stainless steel was deposited onto 300M steel substrate using a fiber delivered disk laser and a powder blown coaxial nozzle. The delay between the clad tracks was aimed at controlling the in situ quench and tempering sequence during the cladding process. Four different delay times were investigated (continuous build, t = 2 s, t = 5 s, and t = 60 s). No micro-cracking and very little porosity were observed for all variables. The microstructure changed from untempered martensite structure at a continuous build to a fully tempered martensite structure at t = 60 s. The delay time between the clad tracks is the most influential parameter to control the in situ tempering and is crucial to restore the tensile and fatigue properties of aero-grade high strength steel for repair applications."
"Siloed diversity: Transnational migration, digital media and social networks Education; Acculturative Stress; Studies Abroad This book examines the experiences of transient migrants in the Asia-Pacific, and in so doing provides new ways of understanding diversity. By focusing on the transient destination hubs of Australia and Singapore, Catherine Gomes shifts our thinking about diversity for two disruptive reasons: the increasingly large and global transient flows of people and our everyday reliance on digital media. The unprecedented usage of digital media influences not only communication patterns and information-seeking behaviour, but has also led to the rapid evolution of the very nature of entertainment and news, and directly impacted on our documenting and mapping of self (e.g. posts of photographs, opinions and links on social media timelines). The book introduces readers to the concept of siloed diversity - a phenomenon which occurs when people rely on a hierarchy of identities developed while in transience to make connections and disconnections with others."

"Profiling interdisciplinary accounting research: an analysis of publication descriptors in three leading journals Ranking; Journal Ranking; AACSB Purpose: The aim of this study is to profile interdisciplinary accounting research and the facilitating role played by researchers by probing the characteristics of published articles in three leading interdisciplinary accounting research journals, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal (AAAJ); Accounting, Organizations and Society (AOS); and Critical Perspectives on Accounting (CPA). Design/methodology/approach: Profiling analysis is undertaken with a broad scan of publication descriptors in AAAJ, AOS and CPA between 2005 and 2016. Profiling stems from identifying and quantifying the characteristics of interdisciplinary research, and with further analysis, infer generalisations about its content and the community of interdisciplinary researchers. Findings: The published output of 1,462 articles is produced by 1,688 authors affiliated with 660 institutions in 52 countries. The two most high-ranking topics are social and environmental accounting and management accounting. The highest-ranked authors are Stephen Walker, Rob Bryer, Lee Parker and Yves Gendron. The most productive universities are the University of London, Cardiff University and the University of Manchester. The countries highly involved in interdisciplinary accounting research are the UK, USA, Australia and Canada. Research limitations/implications: The data is restricted by the sample of manuscripts based on three interdisciplinary accounting research journals for the period 2005â€“2016 and does not consider manuscripts published in other accounting and non-accounting journals. Additionally, the process of analysing publication descriptors to generate categorised lists was a complex process that may not be replicated precisely by other researchers. Practical implications: The results reported in this study can assist researchers interested in interdisciplinary research on what they may expect to read and understand. Originality/value: The present study profiles interdisciplinary research in accounting to gain a picture of the elements that comprise interdisciplinarity, which, at present, is without empirical investigation."

"Inundation of a floodplain lake woodlands system: nutritional profiling and benefit to mature Eucalyptus largiflorens (Black Box) trees Black Box; Murraya; Salt Stress River management continues to challenge riparian systems worldwide, with climate change impacts and anthropogenic extractions escalating. The Murrayâ€“Darling basin (MDB) in Australia is critical to agricultural production and habitat provision to maintain biodiversity. Concern for the condition of native trees and biota in the MDB has led to substantial research investment to increase ecosystem function understanding and improve floodplain and wetland management. This field study offers new insights into tree nutrition and physiology as interpreted against the plant-soil-environment dynamics of recent flooding. Black Box (Eucalyptus largiflorens (Myrtaceae) is the only key native riverine MDB tree restricted to that region; and appears stressed at the far reaches of certain significant floodplain ecosystems. Here, nutritional and ecophysiological comparisons were made between Black Box trees that had just been inundated, and those nearby that had not. Leaf stomatal conductance, transpiration, total soil aluminium (Al) concentration, soil pH, and soil conductivity were different between inundated and dry sites. Soil moisture increased due to inundation, thus reducing tree water stress across the three study locations. Changes in leaf chemistry were not detected at the very early stages of flooding examined in this study. An increase in soil acidity due to inundation may also enhance bioavailability of nutrients to trees. New insight into immediate plant benefits gained from this study suggests further investigation is warranted to elucidate the influence of flood and drought on nutrient balance and how future wetland management can benefit from a more holistic understanding of plant-soil-environment dynamics."
"Lift response of rapidly actuated leading-edge and trailing-edge control surfaces for MAVs Micro Air Vehicle; Membrane; Angle of Attack Small biological flyers and Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) operate in a low Reynolds Number flight regime, close to the ground (within the atmospheric boundary layer), where the flow is known to be highly turbulent. Existing fixed-wing designs with conventional control surfaces mounted on the wingsâ€™ trailing-edges, and actuated with commercially available servo actuators, have not been able to achieve sufficient control authority and rapidity to allow MAVs to fly straight and level in turbulent flow. Inspired by small biological flyers in this flight regime, that are known to utilize unsteady flow phenomena to produce significant control forces, the use of control surfaces hinged at the leading edge of the wing is investigated as a potential solution to improving MAV control response and authority. Two flat-plate airfoils, one with a leading-edge control surface and another with a trailing-edge control surface, were manufactured and tested in a wind tunnel. Dynamic forces were derived from surface pressure measurements at varying control surface deflections and actuation rates, at Reynolds number ranging from 40,000 to 160,000. Rapid actuation of either control surface revealed large transient forces, which could be exploited to compensate for the high-frequency perturbations MAVs encounter when flying in turbulence."

"53. Precinct level (or city level) energy
 use prediction using building data and other data
 sources Over 60% of Australian population live in cities. Understanding the energy use in cities not only help achieve net zero emission targets, fine grained spatial and temporal data of energy use in precincts in cities can help manage electricity infrastructure during extreme events such as bushfires and the COVID19 pandemic. Studies have shown buildings are responsible for nearly 90% of energy use in cities like
New York. In addition to building energy data, data about pedestrian movement, traffic lights are collected at regular intervals, and available as open data in some cities.
This project will focus on predicting precinct level energy use using data from buildings and other mobility patterns. A data driven energy consumption model that utilizes building data and mobility data will be developed. This model can inform energy use behavior for optimally managing urban infrastructure during normal periods and extreme events.

"Ecosystem dynamics: exploring the interplay within fintech entrepreneurial ecosystems Crowdfunding; Lending; Fintech Scholars and practitioners continue to recognize the crucial role of entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) in creating a conducive environment for productive entrepreneurship. Although EEs are fundamentally interaction systems of hierarchically independent yet mutually dependent actors, few studies have investigated how interactions among ecosystem actors drive the entrepreneurial process. Seeking to address this gap, this paper explores how ecosystem actor interactions influence new ventures in the financial technology (fintech) EE of Singapore. Guided by an EE framework and the use of an exploratory-abductive approach, empirical data from semi-structured interviews is collected and analyzed. The findings reveal four categories representing both the relational perspective, which features interaction and intermediation dynamics, and the cultural perspective, which encompasses ecosystem development and regulatory dynamics. These categories help explain how and why opportunity identification and resource exploitation are accelerated or inhibited for entrepreneurs in fintech EEs. The present study provides valuable contributions to scholars and practitioners interested in EEs and contributes to the academic understanding of the emerging fintech phenomenon."
"Rice-shrimp ecosystems in the Mekong Delta: Linking water quality, shrimp and their natural food sources Biofloc Technology; Penaeus Vannamei; Aquaculture Aquatic ecosystems are used for extensive rice-shrimp culture where the available water alternates seasonally between fresh and saline. Poor water quality has been implicated as a risk factor for shrimp survival; however, links between shrimp, water quality and their main food source, the natural aquatic biota inhabiting these ponds, are less well understood. We examined the aquatic biota and water quality of three ponds over an entire year in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, where the growing season for the marine shrimp Penaeus monodon has been extended into the wet season, when waters freshen. The survival (30â€“41%) and total areal biomass (350â€“531 kg haâˆ’1) of shrimp was constrained by poor water quality, with water temperatures, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentrations falling outside known optimal ranges for several weeks. Declines in dissolved oxygen concentration were matched by declines in both shrimp growth rates and lipid content, the latter being indicative of nutritional condition. Furthermore, as the dry season transitioned into the wet, shifts in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton were accompanied by declines in the biomass of benthic algae, an important basal food source in these systems. Densities of the benthic invertebrates directly consumed by shrimp also varied substantially throughout the year. Overall, our findings suggest that the survival, condition and growth of shrimp in extensive rice-shrimp ecosystems will be constrained when poor water quality and alternating high and low salinity negatively affect the physiology, growth and composition of the natural aquatic biota. Changes in management practices, such as restricting shrimp inhabiting ponds to the dry season, may help to address these issues and improve the sustainable productivity and overall condition of these important aquatic ecosystems."

"Life cycle assessment of alkali-activated concretes under marine exposure in an Australian context Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali Alkali-activated concretes have been shown to be an environmentally advantageous construction material as they utilize waste or by-products as precursors, such as fly ash and ground blast furnace slag. These concretes also have the ability to achieve strengths suitable for structural applications. However, each mix design of an alkali-activated concretes is unique and requires a detailed life cycle analysis to determine the environmental impact and cost viability. This study evaluates the feasibility of alkali-activated fly ash or fly ash geopolymer and alkali-activated slag concrete developed for application in Australia currently subject to long term site performance studies. This paper reports a detailed life cycle assessment analysis of these concretes to assess their environmental footprint. The paper considers three distinct allocation methods: baseline, mass, and economic allocation, with two system boundaries: manufacture and construction. The study shows AAS concrete has a lower environmental impact than an equivalent strength PC concrete in two impact categories, global warming potential and eutrophication, while acidification and human toxicity depend on the allocation method applied in the manufacturing stage. The global warming potential (100-years) of AAS is 5.25â€“35% less than PC concrete. The FAGP concrete has more negative impacts on the environment than PC-based concrete, regardless of which allocation method is applied. The report highlights alkaline activators and transportation of raw materials as the main environmental impact contributors to concrete manufacture. The global warming potential of FAGP is 22â€“34% higher than the equivalent PC concrete in the baseline method. For the construction stage boundary, machinery appliances for handling concrete and transportation only contributes a small environmental impact (<4%) compared with concrete manufacturing. Cost estimation for concrete production suggests that the cost of the alkali-activated concrete is competitive with the conventional concrete market, dependant on the proximity of the feedstocks and the cost of sodium silicate. Neglecting the transportation cost of feedstocks, the cost of AAS concrete can be 4.8% cheaper, whereas the cost of FAGP concrete is 2.7% more expensive than PC concrete."

"Sustainability and academic air travel in Australian universities Snow Making; Skiing; Skis Purpose: Air travel is becoming increasingly recognized as a source of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. This is particularly relevant for the university sector, which relies heavily on staff air travel for domestic and international mobility. Design/methodology/approach: Using a qualitative content and textual analysis of Australian university sustainability policies, documents and Web pages, this paper discusses the extent to which these organizations take the task of reducing emissions from flying seriously. Findings: Universities fall into one of three groups in this regard. â€œAir Travel Ignorersâ€ are organizations that either have no sustainability policy or none that recognize air travel as a source of greenhouse gas emissions. The second group â€“ â€œRecognition without Interventionâ€ â€“ describes universities that do acknowledge the role of air travel in their carbon footprint, but do not propose any means to reduce the amount of flying they do. Third, â€œAir Travel Substitutersâ€ seek to substitute their air travel with a digital form of mobility, usually video conferencing. Research limitations/implications: The authors then highlight the need to decrease and denormalize university air travel through shifting shared expectations of mobility for events such as conferences and meetings. Practical implications: By way of a conclusion, the authors discuss the nature of air travel for Australian academia and the relationship between various forms of mobility, connectedness and co-presence. Originality/value: This is the first comprehensive analysis of Australian university sustainability policies with respect to air travel."

"How Can Human Values be Addressed in Agile Methods? A Case Study on SAFe Scrum; Agile Software Development; Project Management Agile methods are predominantly focused on delivering business values. But can Agile methods be adapted to effectively address and deliver human values such as social justice, privacy, and sustainability in the software they produce? Human values are what an individual or a society considers important in life. Ignoring these human values in software can pose difficulties or risks for all stakeholders (e.g., user dissatisfaction, reputation damage, financial loss). To answer this question, we selected the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), one of the most commonly used Agile methods in the industry, and conducted a qualitative case study to identify possible intervention points within SAFe that are the most natural to address and integrate human values in software. We present five high-level empirically-justified sets of interventions in SAFe: artefacts, roles, ceremonies, practices, and culture. We elaborate how some current Agile artefacts (e.g., user story), roles (e.g., product owner), ceremonies (e.g., stand-up meeting), and practices (e.g., business-facing testing) in SAFe can be modified to support the inclusion of human values in software. Further, our study suggests new and exclusive values-based artefacts (e.g., legislative requirement), ceremonies (e.g., values conversation), roles (e.g., values champion), and cultural practices (e.g., induction and hiring) to be introduced in SAFe for this purpose. Guided by our findings, we argue that existing Agile methods can account for human values in software delivery with some evolutionary adaptations."
"Evaluating the environmental impact of sun creams in Port Phillip Bay In this project we aim to assess the impact of sun protection products used by Australians that are washed off into the marine environment and subsequently interact with Australian marine environment. Tons of suncream being used in Victoria every year and still the effects of it are not scientifically validated. A vast number (~ 3,000) of sea water samples around most highly populated beaches in Victoria will be collected
by citizens and will be analysed for various metal nanoparticles and chemicals used in sun cream by
employing Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS), Gas Chromatography and High
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Further, a detailed environmental toxicology assessment will be performed for all the water samples. On the basis of generated data sets a correlation between use of sun cream and its environment impact will be generated and a theory will be postulated that will try to answer the following question, whether the sun cream has any effect or noeffect

"Life Cycle Cost and Assessment of Alternative Railway Sleeper Materials Ballast; Prestressed Concrete; Railroad Improvements in plastic recycling technology along with pressure to reduce emissions and waste has led to a desire to find environmentally friendly, cost competitive railway sleepers. This study conducts life cycle analyses of emissions and costs for timber, concrete, short fibre and long fibre composite railway sleepers to determine which sleepers are more environmentally friendly and cost competitive. The results clearly highlight the environmental advantages of short fibre plastic composites. The basic scenario had concrete sleepers being the most cost competitive, before factoring in the recyclability and likely future cost reductions of short fibre composite sleepers. With as little as 50% of the entirely recyclable short fibre sleepers being recycled their cost quickly becomes comparable to concrete sleepers. Further, there are several likely changes in the future that will make short fibre sleepers even more cost competitive. The short fibre industry is still growing and could substantially reduce costs through the effects of economies of scale and experience curves of production. A further driver of future cost competitiveness would be the broader use of an Australian or international carbon price, where concrete sleepers have a disadvantage. Together, these changes indicate that short fibre composites have great potential financially and environmentally."

"Designer Ecosystems for the Anthropocene—Deliberately Creating Novel Ecosystems in Cultural Landscapes Anthropocene; Climate Change; Environment Crisis Accepting that nature and culture are intricately co-evolved has profound implications for the ethical, legal, philosophical and pragmatic dimensions of social and environmental policy. The way we think about nature affects how we understand and manage ecosystems. While the ideals of preserving wilderness and conserving ecosystems have motivated much conservation effort to date, achieving these ideals may not be feasible under Anthropocene conditions unless communities accept custodial responsibilities for landscapes and other species. This paperâ€™s origins are in the authorâ€™s work with the Martuwarra Fitzroy River Council representing Indigenous traditional owners in Australiaâ€™s Kimberley region. These landscapes, shaped by 60,000 years of human occupation, interweave knowledge, laws and governance regimes, and material and spiritual connections with country. This interweaving offers insights into options for dealing with humanityâ€™s complex sustainability challenges. The paper also draws on the literature about cultural landscapes, ecological design, agroecology and permaculture to explore options for applying ecological design as a planning and problem-solving framework. The paper concludes that design-based approaches offer significant opportunities for using ecological science to integrate conservation and production in agricultural landscapes in ways that can meet human needs while also conserving biodiversity under climate change."

"Design of ternary blend high-volume fly ash concrete mixes using hydrated lime Coal Ash; Silica Fume; Concretes The increase of carbon emission due to annual growth of Portland cement (PC) production has enforced research into the development of sustainable green concrete using a range of readily available industrial waste materials. The present study is focused on developing two high volume fly ash (HVFA) concretes with cement replacement levels 65% (HVFA?65) and 80% (HVFA?80). Initially, the required lime for both HVFA concrete mixes were determined, and then the optimized mix design identified, based on 28-day strength, by varying the fly ash?lime combination. The optimized mixes achieved a compressive strength of 53MPa and 40MPa, for HVFA?65 and HVFA?80 concretes, respectively. Similar to PC concrete, both HVFA concretes showed high resistance to chloride penetration, water absorption and carbonation at 28 days. The early stage strength development is dependent upon the matrix produced in the specific HVFA concrete, which is itself dependent upon the number of unreacted fly ash spheres."

"Constructing the responsibility to protect: Contestation and consolidation Humanitarian Intervention; First International; Ethnic Cleansing This volume examines the ongoing construction of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine, elaborating on areas of both consolidation and contestation. The book focuses on how the R2P doctrine has been both consolidated and contested along three dimensions, regarding its meaning, status and application. The first focuses on how the R2P should be understood in a theoretical sense, exploring it through the lens of the International Relations constructivist approach and through different toolkits available to conventional and critical constructivists. The second focuses on how the R2P interacts with other normative frameworks, and how this interaction can lead to a range of effects from mutual reinforcement and co-evolution through to unanticipated feedback that can undermine consensus and flexibility. The third focuses on how key state actors - including the United States, China and Russia - understand, use and contest the R2P. Together, the bookâ€™s chapters demonstrate that broad aspects of the R2P are consolidated in the sense that they are accepted by states even while other, specific aspects, remain subject to contestation in practice and in policy. This book will be of much interest to students of the R2P, human rights, peace studies and international relations."

"Indigenous Leadership at the Corporate Accountability Symposium, November 2018 How businesses conduct themselves and impact communities, workers, consumers and other stakeholders shapes our world. The importance of fostering sound human rights practices in business and providing redress when rights are breached is gaining increasing recognition in Australia and globally.  We seek funding for a Corporate Accountability Symposium and research to ensure that Indigenous concerns around corporate accountability are central to the Symposium. 

CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY SYMPOSIUM, NOVEMBER 2018

A two-day Corporate Accountability Symposium will be held in November 2018, organised by the Australian Corporate Accountability Network.  The Symposium will bring international experts as well as indigenous groups from overseas and within Australia together with policy makers and key partner organisations in Australia to set a policy agenda for business and human rights in Australia.  The aim of this funding is to ensure that indigenous concerns are at the centre of policy development.  The first day will bring state and federal policy makers together to progress the business and human rights policy that was agreed between business and civil society through the Australian Government’s Multi-Stakeholder Advisory Group on Business and Human Rights that the Australian government abandoned in 2017.  The second day of the Symposium will be open to the public.  The Symposium aligns with the Social Change priority area of Transformations in health and social policy and practice. Funds will be used to fly indigenous Australians to the Symposium and bring international experts to Australia.  Side events at RMIT will be organised, also, to develop RMIT staff and student knowledge of indigenous concerns around corporate accountability and build ties with international and Australian experts.

"Female warriors: a reproduction of patriarchal narrative of Hua Mulan in The Red Detachment of Women (1972) China; Mao Zedong; Socialist During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the CCP officially claimed that Chinese women achieved an equal position as men, and the Confucian patriarchal family was deconstructed. This article is an ongoing exploration of Maoist gender discourse by analysing the image of female warriors in the revolutionary opera film, The Red Detachment of Women (1972) which was made and popularised during the Cultural Revolution. This article finds that Maoist gender discourse failed to deconstruct the Confucian patriarchy. The image of female warriors in the revolutionary opera films was a reproduction of the patriarchal narrative of Hua Mulan, which served an ethical symbol of loyalty and filial daughter in the discourse of Confucian patriarchy. Similar to Mulan, the masculinised image of female warriors in the revolutionary opera films cannot be identified as a feminist representation yet a cultural and ethical symbol of filial daughter that leads to womenâ€™s subordination to menâ€™s needs."

"Modelling the energy performance of residential buildings using advanced computational frameworks based on RVM, GMDH, ANFIS-BBO and ANFIS-IPSO Load Forecasting; Prediction; Energy Model Modelling the heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) is the cornerstone of the designing of energy-efficient buildings, since it determines the heating and cooling equipment requirements needed to retain comfortable indoor air conditions. Advanced and specialised modelling tools for energy-efficient buildings may provide a reliable estimation of the effect of alternative building designs. However, implementing these tools can be a labour-intensive task, very time-consuming and dependent on user experiences. Hence, in this study, four advanced computational frameworks including relevance vector machine (RVM), group method of data handling (GMDH), hybridization of adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS) and biogeography-based optimisation (BBO), i.e. ANFIS-BBO, and hybridization of ANFIS and improved particle swarm optimisation (IPSO), i.e. ANFIS-IPSO, are proposed as novel approaches to predict the heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) of residential buildings. Obtained results from the proposed models are compared using several performance parameters. In addition, several visualisation methods including Taylor diagram, regression characteristic curve, a novel method called accuracy matrix and rank analysis are used to demonstrate the model with the best performance. Furthermore, Andersonâ€“Darlingâ€™ Normality (A-D) test and Mannâ€“Whitney Uâ€™ (M âˆ’ W) tests are studied as non-parametric statistical test for further investigations of the models. Obtained results indicate the excellent ability of the applied models to map the non-linear relationships between the input and output variables. Result also identified RVM as the best predictive model among four proposed models. Finally, two equations are derived from the RVM model to address the HL and CL of residential buildings."

"What happened to the outside? Exploring the role of 'nature' in household retrofits This project aims to place ‘natures’, specifically, trees and plants, climate and heat, more firmly into discussions of household retrofit and fuel poverty, and to explore the implications of doing so for 
policy and practice. The project aims to produce a framework outlining the ways natures influence and  figure in experiences and practices of household retrofit. The following questions will guide the 
project:
1. Where, how and why do ‘natures’ figure in experiences and practices of household retrofit?
2. What do these experiences mean for retrofit and fuel poverty policy responses? How might this help broaden the lens through which we a) view the opportunities and barriers to retrofit 
and alleviate energy poverty, and b) focus policy and program responses? "
"Locus of control and energy poverty Locus of Control; Labour Market; Personality Traits We examine the impact of locus of control (LoC) on energy poverty. Using 15 waves of longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey and a supplementary dataset that collects information on household energy choices, we examine the direct effects of LoC on subjective and objective indicators of energy poverty. We also examine the role of savings, gambling behaviour, trust and household energy choices as potential channels through which LoC transmits to energy poverty. We find that being more internal on LoC is associated with a lower likelihood of being energy poor. Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in being more internal on LoC is associated with a 0.028 standard deviation decline in the probability of being energy poor as defined by the low-income high-cost measure of energy poverty and a 0.125 standard deviation decline in the probability that one is unable to heat their home. We find that savings, gambling behaviour, social capital and being proactive in installing energy-saving lighting and not leaving the lights on in the house throughout the day are channels through which LoC influences energy poverty."

"Are women nursing academics represented in university leadership positions? Nursing Education; Nurses; Educators The nursing workforce constitutes the largest professional health workforce in Australia. Nursing is traditionally a female dominated profession. This study reviewed Australian universities that provide entry to practice nursing education. The study identified the distribution of females and males in leadership in nursing education, the positioning of the discipline in the university, and where nurses occupy leadership roles above the nursing discipline (faculty/college). Of the 37 universities that offered entry to practice nursing, more females were evident. However, more men were evident in academia than the proportion of men in nursing outside of the academic setting. Leadership nomenclature varied within each nursing discipline group reviewed. This study demonstrated that the number of nursing academics has decreased since the late 1990â€™s. The nursing workforce is still a significant contributor to the academic workforce and yet numbers of nurse academics working in roles senior to their discipline were few. This paper discusses how the nursing workforce as predominantly female, has implications to both females and males, and may impact opportunities for leadership and promotion to senior roles. Practitioner Notes 1. Nursing workforce is the largest health professional workforce in Australia 2. Women outnumber men in academic nursing 3. Proportionally more men hold academic nursing leadership roles 4. Nurses in leadership roles above the discipline in academic settings are underrepresented 5. Entry to practice nursing is represented in 37 Australian universities."

"Micro histories of intercultural knowledge exchange: Tao Xingzhi’s educational poetry Place; Luhmann; Alexander Von Humboldt Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a micro historical account of the work of a key Chinese educational reformer, Tao Xingzhi (1891â€“1946), who transformed educational ideas from John Dewey to effect social and cultural change in 1920sâ€“1940s China. Design/methodology/approach: This paper examines English and Chinese language sources, including Taoâ€™s poetry, to present a fresh analysis of Taoâ€™s epistemological life history. It draws upon transnational historical approaches to chart the multidirectional circulation of progressive education philosophies around the globe. It also explores some conceptual dimensions of Chinese historical thinking and historiographical strategies. Findings: Tao Xingzhi engaged in critical intercultural knowledge exchange in implementing educational reforms in China. He blended and critiqued Chinese and Deweyian educational philosophies to create unique educational reform, which involved reversing some of Deweyâ€™s approaches as well as adapting others. Originality/value: This paper foregrounds Tao Xingzhiâ€™s agency in transforming some of Deweyâ€™s ideas in the Chinese context and challenges studies that adopt an â€œimpact-responseâ€ approach to Taoâ€™s contribution, which suggest a one-way flow of knowledge from a â€œmodernâ€ West to a â€œtraditionalâ€ China. It brings hitherto unexplored Chinese language sources to an English-speaking audience, particularly Taoâ€™s poetry, to gain new historical insights into Taoâ€™s educational reforms. It contributes to transnational understandings of the multidirectional flows of knowledge about Progressive educational philosophies around the world."

"Protecting nature on private land using revolving funds: Assessing property suitability Conservation Planning; Reserve Design; Environmental Protection Protecting biodiversity on private land is an important and growing part of global conservation efforts. Revolving funds are used by conservation organisations to buy, resell and permanently protect private land with important ecological values. By reinvesting proceeds from sales in additional properties, revolving funds offer a potentially cost-effective way to protect biodiversity. Their success requires managers to choose properties that can be resold and recover costs, with resale outcomes having consequences for subsequent acquisitions. However, revolving fund property selection is a multi-dimensional decision, influenced by various ecological, social and financial considerations. In conjunction with revolving fund managers, we developed a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to understand which factors they consider to be the most influential on a propertyÊ¼s suitability for acquisition, and how much to pay for it. Sensitivity analysis revealed that managers perceive property suitability to be heavily influenced by the threat to the propertyÊ¼s ecological values, the acquisition and ongoing management costs, and finding alternative options for protection. Amenity values were seen to heavily influence property resale. Threat and alternative options influence how much to pay, but most influential was the balance of the fund when the purchasing decision is made. Our results suggest managers are taking a low risk approach to property selection. Opportunities may exist to apply revolving funds to higher risk properties otherwise difficult to conserve, provided the need for resale is still met. Ensuring revolving funds target properties with suitable attributes could increase the contribution of this tool to conserving biodiversity on private land."

"Combination of steam explosion and ionic liquid pretreatments for efficient utilization of fungal chitin from citric acid fermentation residue Biomass; Delignification; Ethanol Production Aspergillus niger mycelium residues, a citric acid fermentation by-product, is a raw material for fungal chitosan and glucosamine (GlcN). However, traditional chemical extraction of fungal chitosan and GlcN uses strong acid at high temperatures for long periods and has several drawbacks, including high cost and environmental pollution. In this work, the residues were pretreated by the combination of steam explosion (SE) and ionic liquid (IL) to produce fungal chitosan and GlcN hydrochloride. Following chemical extraction, GlcN hydrochloride yield increased by 65.49 Â± 8.14%, and soluble sugar release reached 0.36â€“0.46 g/g via SE pretreatment at 2.5 MPa for 1 min. Fungal chitosan was produced via enzymatic hydrolysis. Combined SE and IL pretreatment increased deacetylation degree (1.29 Â± 0.06-fold) of fungal chitosan by chitin deacetylase hydrolysis using Rhodococcus equi CGMCC14861 (ReCDA) at 37 Â°C for 6 h. Besides, fungal chitosan was produced using a by-product recycling strategy, promoting ReCDA fermentation, using supernatant with soluble sugars and proteins. After mixing 0.2 g by-product supernatant with 100 mL medium, ReCDA production was 1.5-fold higher than that in the control. This study demonstrates a green technology for efficient utilization of fungal chitin from A. niger mycelium residues of citric acid fermentation."

"Cyclic-RGDfK-Directed Docetaxel Loaded Nanomicelles for Angiogenic Tumor Targeting Micelle; Polyethylene Glycol 1000; Succinic Acid Targeting angiogenesis is a strategy to better control tumor growth and metastasis. Î±vÎ²3 is an integrin, involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and overexpressed in angiogenic endothelial cells and various cancers including breast, prostate, pancreatic, and brain cancers. cRGDfK peptide has high specificity towards Î±vÎ²3 integrin receptors. Docetaxel (DTX) is a broad spectrum anticancer drug, widely used to treat breast, ovarian, prostate, non-small-cell lung, gastric, and neck cancers. Its clinical application is limited owing to its poor aqueous solubility, low oral bioavailability, and nonspecific cytotoxicity. The nanocarriers help to overcome these limitations and further can be surface-modified to conjugate ligand to achieve selective delivery to tumor. d-Î±-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) is a water soluble derivative of natural d-Î±-tocopherol (Vit E). TPGS-based engineered nanocarrier systems have been shown to transport and deliver anticancer drugs more efficiently than the pristine drugs. Herein, we attempt to improve the therapeutic potential of DTX and to target the integrin receptor overexpressing angiogenic tumors, by encapsulating the DTX in nanomicelles and conjugating to cRGDfK peptide for tumor targeting. These nanomicelles are characterized by various analytical techniques and their potential of selective targeting is also evaluated. In the present chapter, we provide the general procedure used in this study: (1) synthesis and characterization of succinoyl-TPGS, (2) preparation and characterization of docetaxel loaded TPSA nanomicelles (DNM), (3) bioconjugation, quantification, and characterization of cRGDfK peptide to DNM (PDNM), (4) in vitro evaluation of cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles, (5) antiangiogenic activity, and (6) stability studies."

"Knowledge, skills, attributes and experience (ksae) for ipd-alliancing task motivation Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management This chapter focuses on the talents and human-capital contribution made by teams engaged in integrated project delivery. It is concerned with defining and discussing the desirable qualities that people working on in integrated project delivery (IPD)-alliancing projects need. The chapter discusses the impact that IPD-alliancing has on the way that participants may view their work and that may explain why this form of project delivery has been found to be a successful form in Australia. The skills, knowledge, attributes and experience required of people within a collaborative IPD project provide a different emphasis than that of traditional competitive business-as-usual (BAU) projects. The chapter shows that understanding of how the project delivery environmental context leads to people experiencing a more meaningful and personally rewarding, motivational attitude towards their work, which in turn triggers superior project delivery outcomes from the BAU context. It draws on two levels of context: the organisational-level context and the individual-level context."

"Long-term effects of sewage sludge–derived biochar on the accumulation and availability of trace elements in a tropical soil Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Thermal treatment by pyrolysis has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to enable the agricultural use of sewage sludge. The solid product obtained via pyrolysis of sewage sludge is called sewage sludge biochar and presents several advantages for its use as a fertilizer or soil conditioner. However, there are concerns about the accumulation and dynamics of trace elements in soil amended with sewage sludge biochar over the years. This study examined the effect of sewage sludge biochar, under field conditions for 5 yr, on the accumulation and availability of trace elements in a tropical soil. For this, 15 t haâ€“1 of sewage sludge biochar produced at 300 and 500 Â°C were applied in the first two growing seasons. Application was interrupted from the third to the fifth seasons to assess the residual effect of sewage sludge biochar in the soil. The total and available trace element concentrations were determined. The total contents of trace elements showed the following variation in the soil over the 5 yr (mg kgâ€“1): Cd (16.8â€“20.0), Co (19.5â€“21.5), Cr (98.2â€“125.7), Cu (8.1â€“17.1), Mn (62.9â€“85.7), Ni (20.3â€“35.0), Pb (27.0â€“52.4), and Zn (20.3â€“35.8). There was no change in the availability of Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb over the years. Additionally, a residual effect of the sewage sludge biochar was the increase in availability of trace elements that are considered essential (Cu, Mn, and Zn) and beneficial elements (Co) for plants. Therefore, in relation to contamination by trace elements, the pyrolysis of sewage sludge of domestic origin proved to be an adequate strategy to enable the safe use of this residue in tropical agriculture."

"France’s #nuit debout social movement: Young people rising up and moral emotions Social Movements; Protest; Activism Set against a backdrop of austerity and neoliberal policies affecting many young people adversely, the Nuit Debout protest movement in France began in March 2016 when people gathered in public spaces to oppose the Socialist governmentâ€™s plan to introduce neoliberal labour legislation. Like other post-2008 movements, Nuit Debout was leaderless, non-hierarchical, and relied on social media for political communication and to mobilise participants. The Nuit Debout was also a movement inspired by powerful moral-political emotions such as righteous anger and hope. In this article, the authors address two questions. First, what features of Nuit Debout distinguished it from earlier social movements in France? Second, what role did moral emotions play in mobilising people to act as they did? Drawing on interviews with young protestors and their own testimonies, we argue that Nuit Debout was a distinctive form of protest for France. One distinguishing feature was the way young peopleâ€”the â€œprecarious generationâ€â€”were motivated by a strong sense of situated injustice, much of which related to what they saw as the unfairness of austerity policies, being deprived of a decent future and the feeling they had been betrayed by governments."

"Quantifying the technical service requirements of future power systems Increasing penetration of VREs leads to a set of increasingly difficult challenges: they are weather dependent, which leads to variability and uncertainty that must be managed at a sub hourly and seasonal timescale; they are interfaced to the power system by inverters,
which drives a variety of system challenges; and they are inherently more distributed, which can pose a challenge to system operators tasked with monitoring them. Other changes, including increasing energy storage deployment and more actively varied demand driven by
DER, can pose additional challenges independent of or compounded by VRE. At the heart of these research challenges are “services” that need to evolve with the changing characteristics of the power system and are fundamental to supporting the sociotechnical objective of “reliably maintaining supply-demand balance, at all points in time, at all locations, at least cost, equitably, and with minimum impact on the environment”. These services determine: the operation and planning of the electricity grid across all time scales; the required characteristics of the technologies connected to the power system; and, through commercial mechanisms, the incentives to innovate and invest and to do so equitably. Current state-of-the-art services (e.g., capacity adequacy, ancillary services, etc.) fall far short of future service requirements; there is a danger of developing electricity grids that are costly, unreliable, inequitable, and not resilient and will therefore not deliver the step-change needed for the energy transition.

This paper asks if state-based regulation in the economic-North advanced under the Business and Human Rights agenda: disclosure-based regimes, due diligence compliance regimes and trade-based regimes, could advance efforts to improve respect for human rights in this sector. It adopts fields of struggle lens and global value chain theoretical approaches to business power and governance to understand the challenging political and economic dynamics that entrench harm within sandstone quarrying in Rajasthan. This analysis suggests that company-based disclosure and due diligence regimes will struggle to ameliorate these dynamics whilst trade-based approaches hold some potential to generate meaningful change."
"The concentrated polyaluminum chloride with tailor-made distribution of al species: synthesis, distribution and transformation of al species, and coagulation performance Wastewater Treatment; Aluminum Oxychloride; Flocculation Production of concentrated polyaluminum chloride (PACl) with the proper distribution of Al species (Ala, Alb, and Alc) is still a challenging issue on both industrial and laboratory scale. Hence, the effects of total aluminum concentration (AlT) at high levels, regular basicity values, and low base injection rates on the distribution of Al species in PACl solutions were investigated using quadratic models. The results confirmed the possibility to synthesize tailor-made PACl solutions with a specified value of either Ala, Alb, or Alc within the range of 22â€“51%, 4â€“51%, or 0.5â€“74%, respectively. For instance, in agreement with the predicted value, a PACl sample rich in both Alb (42,200 ppm) and AlT was produced by applying the basicity of 1.7, AlT of 9.07% as Al2O3, and basification rate of 0.48 ml/h. In addition, the maximum Alc could be acquired by exploiting the highest C, B, and Q values. This condition also minimized both Ala and Alb. The trends of Ala and Alc changes by the increment of basicity were concave and convex, respectively, while Alb showed either a decreasing trend or a concave pattern based on the values of injection rate and AlT. The Alb-rich PACl sample was effectively applied for turbidity removal from synthetic wastewater at various pHs and initial turbidities. At best, residual turbidity of about 1% was observed after the coagulation process. These findings can be constructive for the production and application of tailor-made PACl."

"Towards good governance of urban greening: insights from four initiatives in Melbourne, Australia Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework Urban greening can enhance sustainability and liveability, through conserving biodiversity, mitigating urban heat and enhancing peopleâ€™s health and wellbeing. However, urban greening is complex, as it occurs in unique ecological settings, with social, cultural and economic factors shaping the forms it takes. This raises questions about the governance of urban greening, including what counts as â€˜good governanceâ€™. In this paper, we first outline principles of good governance drawn from the natural resource management context. We then present four urban greening initiatives from Melbourne Australia representing different scales, land tenures and organising structures. Following this, we analyse how governance of the four initiatives addresses good governance principles. Our analysis shows that there are diverse ways in which urban greening can be practiced and governed. The importance of more â€˜informalâ€™ initiatives should not be discounted relative to formalised initiatives, as a spectrum of approaches can be seen as strength. Further, in determining what constitutes good governance, the standards against which initiatives are assessed should be tailored to their specific circumstances, and consider impacts to the environment itself. These findings point to good urban greening governance being both situated and principled."

However, neoliberal reforms that have both privatised pipelines and centralised strategic planning decisions have reduced the decision-making power of planners at a local level. This places local planning authorities in an ambiguous position to consider and manage pipeline risk in their professional practice. The paper draws on findings from interviews with stakeholders involved with urban planning and high-pressure gas pipelines, including local planners, in two case study sites in Australia to highlight the impacts of neoliberal planning reforms on the professional practices of planners in managing risks to community safety from gas pipelines. Other researchers have argued that neoliberalism poses problems for the planning profession. Land use planning around high-pressure gas pipelines offers a valuable case study to demonstrate this. This research provides an important contribution to this existing body of research by exploring the effects of neoliberalism through investigation into the lived experiences of planners, showing that these developing trends impact representation of community interests in planning decisions and also public safety."

"DVC as a Supplement to ZVI: Mapping Degree of Visible Change for Wind Farms Wind Farms; Wind Power; Social Rejection Wind farms can profoundly change the appearance of landscapes and how they are experienced. The proliferation of wind farm applications and the visual impacts of larger array footprints and taller turbines raise additional landscape concerns for users and observers. These trends require new assessment methods to evaluate such impacts and supplement visual assessments, stakeholder engagements and decision making. The new concept of Degree of Visible Change (DVC) is formulated to overcome some of the limitations associated with established techniques in Visual Impact Assessments (VIA), in particular Zone of Visual Influence (ZVI) mapping. Developed and tested for a proposed wind farm in Queensland, DVC calculates and maps horizontal (h) and vertical (v) view extents that are occupied by proposed wind turbines, combines these into a new parameter representing visual prominence and defines significance levels based on limits of human Field of View (FOV). DVC also allows the effect of distance attenuation on visibility to be represented, helping to identify affected receptors and their potential levels of visual impacts. This approach provides an additional layer of analysis to map the potential visual intrusion of wind farms and highlights the effect of existing land cover and potential mitigative planting to ameliorate visual impacts."
"Untreated rice husk ash incorporated high strength self-compacting concrete: Properties and environmental impact assessments Cement; Rice Hulls; Mortar The suitability of untreated rice husk ash (URHA) as a supplementary to the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and fine aggregates (FA) in high strength self-compacting concrete (SCC) was investigated in terms of mechanical properties as well as environmental impact assessments (EIA). In total, nine SCC mixes were prepared and investigated with various levels of URHA replacements to OPC and FA. Initially, the fresh and hardened properties of URHA incorporated SCC were determined. Further, EIAs were carried out considering eighteen different environmental impact indices for the optimum URHA incorporated SCC mixes to determine the most appropriate mix in terms of mechanical properties along with their environmental impacts. The experimental results reveal, URHA in the range of 10â€“15% can be used without compromising the fresh and hardened properties of SCC. The results of the EIAs are presented and discussed in terms of compressive strength to environmental indices ratios to normalise the comparison. The EIAs disclose that even through some of the mixes provide better performance in terms of certain environmental impact categories; especially CO2 emission, water pollution (fresh and marine) and ecotoxicity, their strength to environmental impact ratios are relatively low. Thus, it is recommended to select the optimum mix design of URHA incorporated high strength SCC in terms of mechanical properties and as well as EIA."

"Influence of pedestrian age and gender on spatial and temporal distribution of pedestrian crashes Crash Injuries; Crash; Random Parameters Objectives: Every year, about 1.24 million people are killed in traffic crashes worldwide and more than 22% of these deaths are pedestrians. Therefore, pedestrian safety has become a significant traffic safety issue worldwide. In order to develop effective and targeted safety programs, the location- and time-specific influences on vehicleâ€“pedestrian crashes must be assessed. The main purpose of this research is to explore the influence of pedestrian age and gender on the temporal and spatial distribution of vehicleâ€“pedestrian crashes to identify the hotspots and hot times. Methods: Data for all vehicleâ€“pedestrian crashes on public roadways in the Melbourne metropolitan area from 2004 to 2013 are used in this research. Spatial autocorrelation is applied in examining the vehicleâ€“pedestrian crashes in geographic information systems (GIS) to identify any dependency between time and location of these crashes. Spider plots and kernel density estimation (KDE) are then used to determine the temporal and spatial patterns of vehicleâ€“pedestrian crashes for different age groups and genders. Results: Temporal analysis shows that pedestrian age has a significant influence on the temporal distribution of vehicleâ€“pedestrian crashes. Furthermore, men and women have different crash patterns. In addition, results of the spatial analysis shows that areas with high risk of vehicleâ€“pedestrian crashes can vary during different times of the day for different age groups and genders. For example, for those between ages 18 and 65, most vehicleâ€“pedestrian crashes occur in the central business district (CBD) during the day, but between 7:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., crashes among this age group occur mostly around hotels, clubs, and bars. Conclusions: This research reveals that temporal and spatial distributions of vehicleâ€“pedestrian crashes vary for different pedestrian age groups and genders. Therefore, specific safety measures should be in place during high crash times at different locations for different age groups and genders to increase the effectiveness of the countermeasures in preventing and reducing vehicleâ€“pedestrian crashes."

"Local implementation of global accounting reform: evidence from a developing country International Financial Reporting Standards; Accounting Conservatism; Firm Purpose: While the world-wide adoption of international financial reporting standards (IFRS) aims to eliminate differences in national accounting standards between countries, the socio-political institutions surrounding financial reporting practices remain localised. This paper aims to penetrate and reveal the manner in which local national context, stakeholder intentions and financial reporting practices can moderate the compliance with IFRS in a developing country. Design/methodology/approach: An interview-based qualitative research framework was used to analyse the experience and attitudes of accountants, auditors and financial reporting regulators during a passage of accounting reform initiatives. Findings: This paper provides a critical analysis of the financial reporting practices of a developing country that has ostensibly implemented accounting reforms prescribed by the World Bank. It has revealed the key firm- and field-level logics that are experienced and managed by regulators and corporate managers in their approaches to financial reporting and accountability. The World Bank-led accounting reform can be constrained by a complex mix of institutional logics originating from market and corporate structures, networks of institutionalised family and political relationships, professional and regulatory structure and resourcing limitations and cultural business conventions. This paper provides evidence of firm- and field-level logics that contest and influence the emergence of a financial reporting oversight body and lead to highly variable compliance with international accounting standards. Originality/value: This paper aims to extend our knowledge beyond broad national-level elements of institutional orders. It presents a more penetrating examination of the existence and contestation of logics originating from various local and global actors and interests. It presents a theoretical mapping of institutional logics, which operate in international and local settings and also encompass firm- and field-level imperatives. Any effort to understand and improve accounting practices of a developing country need to consider the power, contestation and influence of multiple logics operating in its institutional environment."

"Carbon-efficient closed-loop supply chain network: an integrated modeling approach under uncertainty Closed-Loop Supply Chain; Remanufacturing; Reverse Logistics Inspired by a circular economy paradigm, an evolving momentum of policies and legislations aims to close the loop of product lifecycles through improved level of recycling, remanufacturing, and reuse, with the objective of adding value to the economy while not endangering the environment. However, the trade-off between the environmental and economic sustainability of designing business processes is inevitable. To address this trade-off in the supply chain context, competing objectives regarding both cost minimization and reduction in carbon emission should be simultaneously considered and integrated into a comprehensive model. This complexity is however elevated when uncertainty of demand is taken into consideration. In this study, the design of a closed-loop supply chain is investigated where competing objectives of cost and sustainability of supply chain operations are evaluated under demand uncertainty. Augmented Weighted Tchebycheff (AWT) and Îµ-constraint methods are employed to address the multi-objectivity of the problem while a robust optimization approach is applied to deal with the demand uncertainty. The results confirm that the proposed approach provides efficient solutions for designing a green closed-loop supply chain network."

"Compression properties of multifunctional composite structures with embedded lithium-ion polymer batteries Carbon Fibers; Electrochemical Capacitors; Battery Multifunctional light-weight composite structures that combine high load-bearing properties with electrical energy storage capacity have potential application in energy intensive systems such as electric cars. This paper examines the effect of compression loading on the mechanical and electrical responses of light-weight carbon fibre laminates containing embedded lithium ion polymer (LiPo) batteries. The mechanical and electrical responses of the LiPo battery itself to compression loading are also examined. Embedding batteries has a significant adverse effect on the compressive stiffness, failure stress and fatigue life of laminates. The property reductions are attributed to several factors; namely the compressive properties of the battery being much lower than the composite material, the geometric stress concentration created by the battery, discontinuities in the carbon fibres, and the soft polymer layer at the battery-composite interface that effects load transfer. Experimental testing and finite element analysis reveal that the reduction to the compression properties is dependent on the number and arrangement of the batteries."

"International approaches to protecting and retaining trees on private urban land Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Most studies of urban forest management look at vegetation on public land. Yet, to meet ambitious urban forest targets, cities must attempt to maintain or increase trees and canopy cover on private urban land too. In this study, we review and evaluate international approaches to protecting and retaining trees on private urban land. Our study combines a systematic academic literature review, two empirical social science studies on the views of urban forest professionals, and a global case study review of innovative regulations and incentives aimed at protecting and retaining trees on private urban land. Case studies were evaluated for the extent they exceeded minimum standards or went beyond â€˜business-as-usualâ€™. We found that the most innovative mechanisms combine many regulations, instead of relying on a single regulation, and use financial incentives to retain or plant trees in newly developed or re-developed sites, as well as private residences. We did not find any cases where appropriate monitoring was in place to determine the efficacy and efficiency of these mechanisms. We also found no single simple solution that could effectively and efficiently protect and retain trees on private land. Only by combining policies, planning schemes, local laws, and financial incentives with community engagement and stewardship will cities protect and retain trees on private land. Useful and innovative ways to protecting and retaining trees on private land involves providing solutions at multiple governments levels, embedding trees in existing strategic policy and management solutions, incentivising positive behavior, creating regulations that require payment up front, and engaging the broader community in private tree stewardship."

"Emerging investigator series: Phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater by adsorption on steelmaking slag preceding forward osmosis: An integrated process Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption Phosphorus is a critical non-renewable mineral essential for sustainable crop production. However, it is a primary cause of eutrophication in natural water bodies. Hence, a pragmatic approach that allows wastewater treatment plants to efficiently recover phosphorus from wastewater is needed. In this study, we investigated phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater using an industrial waste product (steelmaking slag) as an adsorbent to selectively separate phosphorus from wastewater before its concentration by the forward osmosis (FO) process. Phosphorus adsorbed on slag was extracted, thereby regenerating the adsorbent medium. The resulting phosphorus-rich solution was further enriched by FO prior to chemical precipitation for phosphorus recovery. Batch test results showed that the equilibrium of phosphorus sorption on the slag medium was achieved within 45 min with an adsorption capacity of 3.8 mg g-1. In continuous-flow column tests, the slag exhibited a stable phosphorus removal efficiency of 82% from wastewater, following which approximately 88% of the phosphate could be extracted from the adsorbent medium. When the phosphorus-rich solution extracted from the adsorbent was passed through the FO membrane, FO could retain 98% of the phosphate. However, the water flux through the FO membrane declined gradually to approximately 20% of the initial value at a water recovery of 90%, which could be attributed to the increasingly concentrated feed solution. The enrichment of phosphate in the concentrated feed by the FO process provided a favorable condition for spontaneous precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphate. This study demonstrates that the proposed combined adsorption-FO process can effectively remove, and thus recover, phosphorus from municipal wastewater."

"Silver-Based Plasmonic Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Reduction Methane Production; Catalyst; Synthesis Gas Light-enhanced valorization of CO2 provides a potentially useful pathway to offsetting carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Ni, a thermally active metal for the methanation of CO2, was coupled with Ag, a metal that exhibits a surface plasmon resonance effect in the visible light region, with the intention of exploiting the catalytic CO2 conversion by Ni and light enhancement from Ag. The catalytic metals were loaded onto an insulating silica support and exposed to 405 nm laser light during the reaction. The impact of the Ni-Ag bimetallic interaction intimacy on the influence of the light illumination on CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity was examined. Sequentially impregnating Ni and Ag (regardless of the order) provided a stronger bimetallic interaction relative to the coimpregnation procedure. The coimpregnated sample, with the weakest metallic interaction, exhibited the highest CH4 productivity in the dark, while irradiating the catalyst at 405 nm had minimal impact on its performance. The poor photoeffect was attributed to the lack of interaction between Ni and Ag in conjunction with the low catalytic activity of Ag. The sequentially impregnated samples, which facilitated a stronger bimetallic interaction, exhibited an increase in CO2 conversion when illuminated, with the greatest improvement produced when Ni was loaded first. The increase in CO2 conversion under laser irradiation was attributed to the contribution of the Ag photoresponse. Comparing the three bimetallic catalysts clearly revealed that Ni-Ag/SiO2 with the strongest bimetallic interaction delivered the highest photoenhancement in terms of both CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity."
"Parameter study and optimization of a half-vehicle suspension system model integrated with an arm-teeth regenerative shock absorber using Taguchi method Energy Harvesting; Active Suspension; Dampers This paper presents a novel regenerative shock absorber that utilizes an arm-teeth mechanism to convert linear to rotational motion and to amplify the generator input speed. The flywheel of the arm-teeth mechanism also acts as an energy-storing element, allowing for smooth operation especially on a rough and uneven road surface. The critical parameters are identified through experiments and the simulation model is established based on a half-vehicle suspension system model. The novelty of this work is the proposed arm-teeth mechanism and the optimization of the half-vehicle suspension system through the Taguchi method. In this method, the ratio of the peak output power over the squared excitation displacement amplitude and the frequency bandwidth of the front and rear shock absorbers are set as targets and evaluated respectively. The effects of each parameter on the targets and the optimal parameter combinations are identified through the Taguchi matrix calculations. The optimized system is evaluated under the excitation of the road surface profiles of Class A, C and E of ISO 8606. It is found that the optimized system is able to harvest more energy with a broader frequency bandwidth than the original system at a certain speed for all three random road profile classifications."

"The Toxicity of Nanoparticles to Organisms in Freshwater Nanocrystal; Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticle; Ecotoxicity Nanotechnology is a rapidly growing industry yielding many benefits to society. However, aquatic environments are at risk as increasing amounts of nanoparticles (NPs) are contaminating waterbodies causing adverse effects on aquatic organisms. In this review, the impacts of environmental exposure to NPs, the influence of the physicochemical characteristics of NPs and the surrounding environment on toxicity and mechanisms of toxicity together with NP bioaccumulation and trophic transfer are assessed with a focus on their impacts on bacteria, algae and daphnids. We identify several gaps which need urgent attention in order to make sound decisions to protect the environment. These include uncertainty in both estimated and measured environmental concentrations of NPs for reliable risk assessment and for regulating the NP industry. In addition toxicity tests and risk assessment methodologies specific to NPs are still at the research and development stage. Also conflicting and inconsistent results on physicochemical characteristics and the fate and transport of NPs in the environment suggest the need for further research. Finally, improved understanding of the mechanisms of NP toxicity is crucial in risk assessment of NPs, since conventional toxicity tests may not reflect the risks associated with NPs. Behavioural effects may be more sensitive and would be efficient in certain situations compared with conventional toxicity tests due to low NP concentrations in field conditions. However, the development of such tests is still lacking, and further research is recommended."

"Will Australia's common carp (Cyprinus carpio) populations develop resistance to Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) if released as a biocontrol agent? Identification of pathways and knowledge gaps Carps; Carp Edema Virus; Koi Due to its significant impacts on the environment and their overabundance in multiple waterways, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) has long been a target for control in southeastern Australia. Local eradication and site-based actions have had limited impacts, instigating national efforts to examine alternatives for effective long-term control, including the release of the exotic pathogen Cyprinid herpesvirus-3 (CyHV-3) as a biological control measure. First described in Germany and Israel in the late 1990s, CyHV-3 causes a serious clinical disease in carp but it is a species-specific virus with no evidence of it causing clinical or histological signs of disease in non-target species. Detailed modelling studies predict that in the short term this virus would effectively suppress high density populations of carp in the rivers and waterbodies of southeastern Australia, particularly in the southern Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). However, the long-term efficacy of CyHV-3 as a biocontrol remains more uncertain, owing to the possibility that the host will develop resistance allowing populations to recover. Here we review the literature to identify the factors that could influence the evolution of host resistance following the release of CyHV-3 in southeastern Australia and suggest follow-up strategies to address knowledge gaps. One of the factors identified as a risk is the influence of common carp hybrids, and the introgression of resistant genes from goldfish (Carassius auratus). Carp Ã— goldfish hybrids exist in southeastern Australia, and even though hybrids are generally not as ecologically fit as parental taxa, the impact of hybrids on the efficacy of CyHV-3 as a biocontrol at a population level needs further evaluation. Australian carp populations are most likely of western European ancestry, with no evidence suggesting that they bear genetic relatedness to resistant carp strains from the Amur river in northeastern Asia, but this needs to be confirmed through genetic comparison. Finally, considering that resistance to CyHV-3 is complex and polygenic, Amur-resistance alleles are absent in the Australian carp populations, and selection pressure on the host due to case fatality would be moderate (60â€“80% mortality), we predict that the evolution of host resistance arising from a random mutation in the genome will develop at a slow pace and resistance might take decades to impact on CyHV-3 field effectiveness."

"Field-only surface integral equations: Scattering from a perfect electric conductor Surface Integral; Method Of Moments; Integral Equation Method A field-only boundary integral formulation of electromagnetics is derived without the use of surface currents that appear in the Strattonâ€“Chu formulation. For scattering by a perfect electrical conductor (PEC), the components of the electric field are obtained directly from surface integral equation solutions of three scalar Helmholtz equations for the field components. The divergence-free condition is enforced via a boundary condition on the normal component of the field and its normal derivative. Field values and their normal derivatives at the surface of the PEC are obtained directly from surface integral equations that do not contain divergent kernels. Consequently, high-order elements with fewer degrees of freedom can be used to represent surface features to a higher precision than the traditional planar elements. This theoretical framework is illustrated with numerical examples that provide further physical insight into the role of the surface curvature in scattering problems."

"A comparative method of air emission impact assessment for building construction activities Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Different construction activities may indicate distinct environmental impacts due to their uniqueness. Ability to assess and compare the environmental impacts from different construction activities can aid the process of minimising emissions at different building construction processes. The study presents a comparative impact assessment methodology to evaluate environmental impacts at different activities during the building construction stage. Significant impact related construction activities for five major impact categories namely global warming potential (GWP 100), acidification potential (AP), Eutrophication potential (EP), Photochemical oxidation formation potential (POFP) and Human toxicity potential (HTP) are compared from the global, regional and local perspectives. A case study of a residential building in Australia is used to demonstrate the application of the functions of the developed method. The results of the case study indicated that the method can be effectively used to compare environmental impacts of different construction activities at different geographical perspectives considered. The method can be used by designers and contractors in comparing impacts of various construction activities to identify the most emission effective construction processes."

"Waste materials for wastewater treatment and waste adsorbents for biofuel and cement supplement applications: A critical review Chromium; Tannery Waste; Fleshings A pragmatic shift is ongoing in waste material management and wastewater treatment technology due to the large amount of waste production worldwide and the necessity for cheap adsorbents to reduce wastewater treatment costs. Improvements in the circular economy and energy recovery from waste materials is another fast-growing concept for promoting sustainability and a greener environment. This review study endeavours to integrate the concept of wastewater treatment by waste materials (agricultural residue, industrial and municipal waste, organic and inorganic sources) and utilization of the used waste adsorbents for value-added products through further treatment. Although very few experimental studies were performed on this concept, this study summarizes the potential valuable products such as regenerated adsorbents, biofuel, soil amendment supplements and cementitious material by utilizing waste adsorbent. Production mechanisms of valuable products is discussed comprehensively. This review also documents the major emerging contaminants, the diverse waste materials as potential adsorbent candidates and conversion processes from waste into adsorbents. The outcome of this review promotes the utilization of waste into multiple useful products generation which may improve waste management and boost the circular economy. The integrated applications of this review describe the commercial window available to accumulate waste materials for large scale applications. Further, sources of energy and nutrients extracted from waste materials after treating polluted water in industries, municipal units and animal husbandries can be a significant contributor to commercial viability in the future."

"Additives migrating from 3D-printed plastic induce developmental toxicity and neuro-behavioural alterations in early life zebrafish (Danio rerio) Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter The environmental impact of exposure to 3D-printed plastics as well as potential migration of toxic chemicals from 3D-printed plastics remains largely unexplored. In this work we applied leachates from plastics fabricated using a stereolithography (SLA) process to early developmental stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity. Migration of unpolymerized photoinitiator, 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (1âˆ’HCHPK) from a plastic solid phase to aqueous media at up to 200 mg/L in the first 24 h was detected using gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry. Both plastic extracts (LC50 22.25% v/v) and 1âˆ’HCHPK (LC50 60 mg/L) induced mortality and teratogenicity within 48 h of exposure. Developmental toxicity correlated with in situ generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an increase in lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation markers and enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in embryos exposed to concentrations as low as 20% v/v for plastic extracts and 16 mg/L for 1âˆ’HCHPK. ROS-induced cellular damage led to induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis which could be pharmacologically inhibited with both antioxidant ascorbic acid and a pan-caspase inhibitor. Neuro-behavioral analysis showed that exposure to plastic leachates reduced spontaneous embryonic movement in 24â€“36 hpf embryos. Plastic extracts in concentrations above 20% v/v induced rapid retardation of locomotion, changes in photomotor response and habituation to photic stimuli with progressive paralysis in 120 hpf larvae. Significantly decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity with lack of any CNS-specific apoptotic phenotypes as well as lack of changes in motor neuron density, axonal growth, muscle segment integrity or presence of myoseptal defects were detected upon exposure to plastic extracts during embryogenesis. Considering implications of the results for environmental risk assessment and the growing usage of 3D-printing technologies, we speculate that some 3D-printed plastic waste may represent a significant and yet very poorly uncharacterized environmental hazard that merits further investigation on a range of aquatic and terrestrial species."

"Uptake, depuration and sublethal effects of the neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, exposure in Sydney rock oysters Neonicotinoids; Imidacloprid; Nicotinic Receptors The broad utilisation of imidacloprid (IMI)in agriculture poses an increasing risk to aquatic organisms. However, the potential impacts on commercially important shellfish and chemical residues after exposure, are yet to be assessed. We investigated the levels of IMI in Sydney rock oyster (SRO)tissue during a three-day uptake and four-day depuration cycle using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. IMI was absorbed from the water, with significantly higher concentrations in the adductor muscles than the gills and digestive glands. Depuration was also fast with a significant drop in tissue concentrations after one day in clean water and complete elimination from all tissues except the digestive gland after four days. The distribution of IMI in SRO after direct exposure using mass spectrometry imaging demonstrated uptake and spatially resolved metabolism to hydroxyl-IMI in the digestive gland and IMI-olefin in the gills. We assessed the effects of IMI on filtration rate (FR), acetylcholinesterase (AChE)activity in the gills, and gene expression profiles in the digestive gland using transcriptomics. Exposure to 2 mg/L IMI reduced the FR of oysters on the first day, while exposure to 0.5 and 1 mg/L reduced FR on day four. IMI reduced the gill AChE activity and altered the digestive gland gene expression profile. This study indicates that commercially farmed SRO can uptake IMI from the water, but negative impacts were only detected at concentrations higher than currently detected in estuarine environments and the chemical residues can be effectively eliminated using simple depuration in clean water."

"Network optimisation and performance analysis of a multistatic acoustic navigation sensor Positioning; Source Localization; Fisher Information Matrix This paper addresses some of the existing research gaps in the practical use of acoustic waves for navigation of autonomous air and surface vehicles. After providing a characterisation of ultrasonic transducers, a multistatic sensor arrangement is discussed, with multiple transmitters broadcasting their respective signals in a round-robin fashion, following a time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme. In particular, an optimisation methodology for the placement of transmitters in a given test volume is presented with the objective of minimizing the position dilution of precision (PDOP) and maximizing the sensor availability. Additionally, the contribution of platform dynamics to positioning error is also analysed in order to support future ground and flight vehicle test activities. Results are presented of both theoretical and experimental data analysis performed to determine the positioning accuracy attainable from the proposed multistatic acoustic navigation sensor. In particular, the ranging errors due to signal delays and attenuation of sound waves in air are analytically derived, and static indoor positioning tests are performed to determine the positioning accuracy attainable with different transmitterâ€“receiver-relative geometries. Additionally, it is shown that the proposed transmitter placement optimisation methodology leads to increased accuracy and better coverage in an indoor environment, where the required position, velocity, and time (PVT) data cannot be delivered by satellite-based navigation systems."

"Beyond the mainstream: Diversity leadership and leading diversity Feminism; Identity Work; Organization Studies Who runs social work education? What can be said about the representation of diverse groups in leadership in social work education? Leadership theory has for some time recognized more marginal or so-called â€˜standpointâ€™ perspectives, in particular gender and â€˜raceâ€™, that take up a lens beyond the mainstream assumptions of white, male, western leadership. Nevertheless, such theorizing in relation to race/ethnicity and difference has largely been conceptualized as deficit to the white, male norm and accordingly focused on the barriers to inclusion and engagement of minority perspectives. This tendency omits to consider the insights and contributions beyond the mainstream perspectives can bring to leadership styles and strategies. This chapter considers diversity in leadership and leading diversity as two key dimensions. It considers the race/ethnicity axis, and the ways it can shape and craft the perceptions of leaders, the ways in which leadership is enacted and how this relates to actions aimed at leading diversity."

"Renewable energy from the solid-state anaerobic digestion of grape marc and cheese whey at high treatment capacity Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production Globally, wine production annually generates some 11 million metric tonnes of grape marc (GM) while the cheese-making industry releases over 200 million m3 yâˆ’1 of effluent. Where value-creation mechanisms are absent, such wastes may be channelled to landfills. The study aimed to evaluate the bioenergy potential of the combined treatment of such wastes. Digestion of feedstock at a ratio 3/1 GM/CW (w/w) was conducted in unstirred conditions at 45 Â°C, following optimisation through the Taguchi Method. Cumulative biogas and methane yields were 0.601 m3 gas kgâˆ’1 VS and 0.363 m3 CH4 kgâˆ’1 VS, respectively. Firmicutes and Bacteroides mediated hydrolysis and acidogenesis, thus providing metabolites to Methanosarcina. Co-digestion can potentially generate 1330 GW h and 482,000 Mt CO2-equivalents avoidance. Wine and dairy industries jointly present a case for value-creation through a circular economy, thereby reducing the dependency on non-renewables, renewing commitment to the Paris Agreement."

"Preventing type 1 diabetes progression via a tolerance inducing vaccine (Administered by Victoria University) We will develop an effective immunotherapy for recent onset T1D with excellent translational potential. In contrast to existing research aiming to eliminate or suppress pathogenic T cells, our distinct approach is to `switch? these T cells into becoming immuno- suppressive / protective, enabling them to maintain a state of benign insulitis to avoid in the long- term the destruction of insulin production. We will use our unique approaches derived from our insights into cancer, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and malaria immunomodulation, namely: altered peptide ligands (APL) and mannan delivery system. As this approach will promote a new beneficial outcome, it is expected to result in sustained beneficial Th2/Tr1 responses to auto- antigens, powerfully eliminating (by conversion) damaging Th1 immunity associated with T1D."

"The Evolving Facets of Bacterial Vaginosis: Implications for HIV Transmission Vagina Flora; Gardnerella Vaginalis; Atopobium Vaginae Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common yet poorly understood vaginal condition that has become a major focus of HIV transmission and immunology research. Varied terminologies are used by clinicians and researchers to describe microbial communities that reside in the female reproductive tract (FRT), which is driven, in part, by microbial genetic and metabolic complexity, evolving diagnostic and molecular techniques, and multidisciplinary perspectives of clinicians, epidemiologists, microbiologists, and immunologists who all appreciate the scientific importance of understanding mechanisms that underlie BV. This Perspectives article aims to clarify the varied terms used to describe the cervicovaginal microbiota and its ""nonoptimal"" state, under the overarching term of BV. The ultimate goal is to move toward language standardization in future literature that facilitates a better understanding of the impact of BV on FRT immunology and risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV."

"Fire resistance of 3D printed concrete composite wall panels exposed to various fire scenarios 3D Printers; Geopolymers; Concretes Purpose: Fire safety of a building is becoming a prominent consideration due to the recent fire accidents and the consequences in terms of loss of life and property damage. ISO 834 standard fire test regulation and simulation cannot be applied to assess the fire performance of 3D printed concrete (3DPC) walls as the real fire time-temperature curves could be more severe, compared to standard fire curve, in terms of the maximum temperature and the time to reach that maximum temperature. Therefore, this paper aims to describe an investigation on the fire performance of 3DPC composite wall panels subjected to different fire scenarios. Design/methodology/approach: The fire performance of 3DPC wall was traced through developing an appropriate heat transfer numerical model. The validity of the developed numerical model was confirmed by comparing the time-temperature profiles with available fire test results of 3DPC walls. A detailed parametric study of 140 numerical models were, subsequently, conducted covering different 3DPC wall configurations (i.e. solid, cavity and rockwool infilled cavity), five varying densities and consideration of four fire curves (i.e. standard, hydrocarbon fire, rapid and prolong). Findings: 3DPC walls and Rockwool infilled cavity walls showed superior fire performance. Furthermore, the study indicates that the thermal responses of 3DPC walls exposed to rapid-fire is crucial compared to other fire scenarios. Research limitations/implications: To investigate the thermal behaviour, ABAQUS allows performing uncoupled and coupled thermal analysis. Coupled analysis is typically used to investigate combined mechanical-thermal behaviour. Since, considered 3DPC wall configurations are non-load bearing, uncouple heat transfer analysis was performed. Time-temperature variations can be obtained to study the thermal response of 3DPC walls. Originality/value: At present, there is limited study to analyse the behaviour of 3DPC composite wall panels in real fire scenarios. Hence, this paper presents an investigation on the fire performance of 3DPC composite wall panels subjected to different fire scenarios. This research is the first attempt to extensively study the fire performance of non-load bearing 3DPC walls."
"“It just fits my needs better”: Autistic students and parents’ experiences of learning from home during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic Autism; Children with Developmental Disabilities; Caregivers Background and aims: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to people's lives, especially for families, whose children have been taken out of schools during lockdown restrictions and required to learn from home. Little is known, however, about the perceived impact of the lockdown restrictions on the educational experiences of autistic children and young people â€“ a group whose conventional schooling experiences are already often challenging. In this study, we sought to (1) understand these experiences from the perspectives of autistic young people and their parents, and (2) identify the underlying sources of positive experiences at this challenging time, in order to inform the ways in which autistic children might flourish at school in more normal times. Methods: Ninety-one Australian participants, including 16 autistic young people aged 12â€“18 years, 32 autistic parents and 43 non-autistic parents of autistic young people aged 3â€“18 years, took part in semi-structured interviews about their experiences of life during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The interviews were subjected to reflexive, thematic analysis to identify themes and subthemes for each research question. Results: Overall, our participants initially found the transition to learning from home extremely challenging, with parents reporting that the support received from schools was far from adequate. After that initial period of transition, however, many autistic children reported flourishing at home both educationally and personally. For these children and families, we identified three key ingredients essential to this flourishing, including: (i) the importance of connected, trusting relationships (â€˜peopleâ€™); (ii) the sensory and social safety of home (â€˜placeâ€™); and (iii) the flexibility to pace and structure learning to suit the individual child (â€˜timeâ€™). Conclusions: While the initial COVID-19 lockdown presented many challenges to children learning at home, there were aspects of this otherwise-unsettling situation that enabled children to thrive and from which we can learn for the future. Implications: These findings have important implications for understanding how and when autistic children might thrive in institutional educational settings once the pandemic subsides, focusing on the relationships between teachers and students, the nature of the physical learning environment and the need for greater flexibility in planning the school day."

"Estimation of the healthcare waste generation during COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh Environmental Pollution; Medical Waste; COVID-19 COVID-19 pandemic-borne wastes imposed a severe threat to human lives as well as the total environment. Improper handling of these wastes increases the possibility of future transmission. Therefore, immediate actions are required from both local and international authorities to mitigate the amount of waste generation and ensure proper disposal of these wastes, especially for low-income and developing countries where solid waste management is challenging. In this study, an attempt is made to estimate healthcare waste generated during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. This study includes infected, ICU, deceased, isolated and quarantined patients as the primary sources of medical waste. Results showed that COVID-19 medical waste from these patients was 658.08 tons in March 2020 and increased to 16,164.74 tons in April 2021. A top portion of these wastes was generated from infected and quarantined patients. Based on survey data, approximate daily usage of face masks and hand gloves is also determined. Probable waste generation from COVID-19 confirmatory tests and vaccination has been simulated. Finally, several guidelines are provided to ensure the country's proper disposal and management of COVID-related wastes."

"Ethnic Diversity and Food Insecurity: Evidence from Ghana Food Pantries; Program Participation; Family Characteristic We examine the link between ethnic diversity and food insecurity. Using data from the Ghana Living Standards Survey, we measure food insecurity using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale and measure ethnic diversity at the district level using information from the Ghana Population and Housing Census. After addressing endogeneity, we find that an increase in ethnic diversity is associated with an increase in food insecurity. This result is robust to different approaches to addressing endogeneity, different measures of ethnic diversity and alternative ways of conceptualising food insecurity. Our findings further show that trust, threat of criminal violence and threat of war/conflict are important channels through which ethnic diversity influences food insecurity."
"Environmental management accounting in the Middle East and North Africa region: Significance of resource slack and coercive isomorphism Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is suffering from serious environmental issues, which are caused mainly by industrial and non-financial business activities. Implementing environmental management accounting (EMA) will help businesses manage environmental issues better and improve how they treat the environment. The key motivation for undertaking this study is that earlier research reported a poor level of environmental accounting practices by firms in the MENA region. These studies documented the necessity to develop a better understanding of EMA practices and the factors that influence their employment. Based on the new institutional sociology (NIS) perspective of institutional theory and resource slack theory, this study examines the influence of technological capabilities, environment-focused human resources management (EFHRM) and institutional isomorphism, specifically on the extent to which EMA practices are implemented in non-financial listed firms from eight MENA countries. These countries are Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan and Egypt. A web-based survey approach was utilised; and the data was analysed through structural equation modelling (SEM). The findings indicated an overall poor widespread of the use of EMA practices in the selected firms as perceived by the participants. Also, the findings suggest that technological capabilities, EFHRM and coercive isomorphism positively and significantly influence how EMA practices are implemented. Coercive pressures, technological and human resources are affecting the extent of EMA use in this study's sample, but not to a great extent. Hence, coercive pressures should be maximised by regulatory bodies in the selected MENA countries in order for EMA practices to be widely accepted. Furthermore, governments should facilitate the outsourcing of experts who can help with implementing EMA practices. It means collaborating with non-government partners, such as accounting associations, industry associations, research & consulting firms and educational institutions. These kinds of collaborations can lead to better support for environmental management and EMA, thus instituting the required educational programs and training to enhance employeesâ€™ awareness of EMA practices that include the role of technology."

"Making the invisible visible Stimulating work health and safety-relevant thinking through the use of infographics in construction design Construction Safety; Occupational Accidents; Accident Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the potential to use infographics to capture, represent and communicate important information to construction designers, such that it improves their ability to understand the implications of design choices for construction workers' health and safety. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on information obtained through a photographic Q-sort, supplemented with a literature review, health and safety information related to the design of a faÃ§ade was collected from subject matter experts. This information was used to develop infographics representing the subject matter knowledge. A facilitated workshop was then held with 20 design professionals to engage them in a hazard identification process using a case study scenario. The designers were provided with the infographics and asked to comment upon how the infographics changed their assessments of the health and safety risks inherent in the case study building design. A sub-set of participants was interviewed to explore their perceptions of the impact and usefulness of the inforgraphics. Findings - Infographics were developed at different levels of detail, representing potential health and safety issues associated with the site location and surroundings, the construction site environment and the detailed faÃ§ade design. Workshop participants identified a number of potential health and safety issues associated with the case study scenario. However, this number increased substantially once they had viewed the infographic. Further, the health and safety issues identified when participants had access to the infographic were more likely to be less visible issues, relating to ergonomic hazards, procurement or the organisation and sequencing of work. The workshop participants who were interviewed described how the infographics enabled them to make a more global assessment of the health and safety implications of the case study building design because it helped them to understand the design in the physical construction site context. Participants also favoured the visual nature of the infographics and suggested that this format may be particularly useful to communicate important health and safety information to novice designers with limited on-site experience. Research limitations/implications - The infographics developed in this research were relatively simple two-dimensional representations produced and presented in hard copy format. It is possible that more sophisticated forms of infographic could have produced different results. Thus, it is important that future research develops different types of infographics and rigorously evaluates their effectiveness in developing designers' health and safety-related knowledge and improving decision making. Practical implications - The results indicate that simple infographics can help design professionals to better understand the health and safety implications of design decisions in the context of the construction site environment. In particular, the infographics appear to have increased designers' ability to recognize less visible health and safety-related issues. The designers interviewed also described the potential usefulness of the infographics in design workshops as a tool to stimulate discussion and develop a shared understanding of the health and safety aspects of a particular design decision or choice. Originality/value - The value of the research lies in the development and evaluation of infographics as a tool supports the integration of health and safety into design decision making. The potential to develop these tools into digital or web-based resources is also significant."

"Towards action research with trans women sex workers: Policy, space and social challenges Gender Dysphoria; Transgender Persons; Transsexualism Trans women face multiple social, economic and health inequalities and the impact of gender oppression and violence is even more profoundly experienced by trans women sex workers, although in culturally specific ways. This paper presents a pilot study conducted to explore and engage with the context of trans women sex workers in Lido Tre Archi, Italy. In line with the community psychology values of social justice, social change and participation, we outline our engagement process and key challenges observed when attempting action research with such a highly marginalised group. Data were collected in the form of ethnographic notes from informal consultations with different stakeholders and participant observations, and of documents (newspaper articles, picture captions) and were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings are organised in three themes relating to the social, policy and physical context in Lido Tre Archi demonstrating evidence of the contextual challenges and how they intertwine to generate a spiral of marginalisation and social exclusion for the participants. We take a collaborative and reflexive stance in our work and conclude with recommended steps and potential limitations to initiate an action research project."
"Optimization of Communication Network Topology in Distributed Control Systems Subject to Prescribed Decay Rate Decentralized Control; Semidefinite Program; Controller In this paper, we propose a simple cohesive framework to find an optimal directed control network topology with minimum number of links while a prescribed decay rate is satisfied in the transient response of a distributed control system. In order to guarantee the system's decay rate to be faster than a prespecified value, a constraint on the dominant eigenvalue of the system is required to be considered. This results in a nonconvex optimization problem as eigenvalue of a parametric nonsymmetric matrix is a nonconvex, nonsmooth, and even non-Lipschitz function. Here, we present a convex equivalent optimization problem whose minimizer also solves this eigenvalue optimization problem. This optimization problem proposes a state-feedback matrix which results in a decay rate faster than a given value while input signal costs are considered. The equivalent optimization problem in combination with sparsity-promoting optimal control constitutes a combinatorial optimization problem. Using alternating direction method of multipliers, the problem is decomposed into a chain of analytically solvable subproblems which are differentiable and separable. The proposed optimization framework includes relative preference between the topology of the control network and the decay rate of the system. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
"Exploring apprenticeship learning for player modelling in interactive narratives Interactive Narrative; Artificial Intelligence; Storytelling In this paper we present an early Apprenticeship Learning approach to mimic the behaviour of different players in a short adaption of the interactive fiction Anchorhead. Our motivation is the need to understand and simulate player behaviour to create systems to aid the design and person-alisation of Interactive Narratives (INs). INs are partially observable for the players and their goals are dynamic as a result. We used Receding Horizon IRL (RHIRL) to learn playersâ€™ goals in the form of reward functions, and derive policies to imitate their behaviour. Our preliminary results suggest that RHIRL is able to learn action sequences to complete a game, and provided insights towards generating behaviour more similar to specific players."

This study provides an analysis of what AGI protection scholars, up to the beginning of 2019, have written about the essence of human beliefs. It is generally advised to use a theory classification system, where the ideas are evaluated following the degree of their sophistication and size of behaviorists-internalists, equally because of the scope of their consensus mankind. We propose several well-supported hypotheses to indicate the difficulty of describing the character of human beliefs and a few meta-level theories are needed."
"A focused review on membrane contactors for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) effluents Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling The need for a more sustainable wastewater treatment is more relevant now due to climate change. Production and reuse of methane from anaerobic treatment is one pathway. However, this is defeated by the presence of dissolved methane in the effluent and would be released to the environment, adding to the greenhouse gas emissions. This review paper provided summary and analysis of studies involved in the production of dissolved methane from AnMBR, focusing with actual methane measurement (gas and dissolved) from AnMBR with different types of wastewater. Then more focused discussion and analysis on the use of membrane-based technology or membrane contactors in the recovery of dissolved methane from AnMBR effluent are included, with its development and energy analysis. The dissolved methane removal and recovery rate of membrane contactors can be as high as 96% and 0.05 mol methane/m2/h, respectively, with very low additional energy requirement of 0.01 kWh/m3 for the recovery. Future perspectives presented focus on the long-term evaluation and modelling of membrane contactors and on the membrane modifications to improve the selectivity of membranes to methane and to limit their fouling and wetting, thus making the technology more economical for resource recovery."

"Enhancement of the intrinsic light harvesting capacity of Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite: Via modification with sulphide Perovskite Solar Cells; Solar Cell; Formamidine Caesium silver bismuth halide double perovskites, in the first instance Cs2AgBiBr6, were recently introduced to the field of emerging photovoltaics as environmentally friendly, non-toxic and thermodynamically stable photoabsorber materials. However, the wide indirect bandgaps of these materials indicate the need for bandgap engineering and enhancing the light absorption to improve the photovoltaic performance. The present work demonstrates that this can be achieved via modification of the double perovskite with sulphide to obtain caesium silver bismuth sulphobromide materials, Cs2AgBiBr6-2xSx, which have been synthesised as pin-hole-free uniform films and systematically investigated herein. Notable enhancements in the intrinsic light absorption for 0 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 0.2 are demonstrated, as are the improvements by up to 50% in the photocurrent density of the corresponding thin-film solar cells. The devices based on the films with the nominal composition Cs2AgBiBr5.8S0.1 delivered a short-circuit current density of 3.0 Â± 0.3 mA cm-2 and a power conversion efficiency of 1.9 Â± 0.1% (cf. 2.1 Â± 0.2 mA cm-2 and 1.3 Â± 0.1%, respectively, for the control cells based on the sulphide-free Cs2AgBiBr6). Equally important, caesium silver bismuth sulphobromides demonstrate excellent stability against all common environmental stimuli, viz. heat, light, and humidity."
"Industry Engagement and Intellectual Property (IP) Enhancement for Microbial Detection Assay Strips (MIDAS) kits Activity Summary and Innovation:
A rapid, low-cost, portable, point-of-use assay for the detection of pathogens such as helminths and enteric viruses in wastewater and biosolids.
This system represents an accurate, rapid and cost-effective technology with the potential to replace polymerase chain reaction based detection methods, which are technically challenged and not ideal for onsite (point-of-care) detection of microbes/viruses in wastewater treatment plants.
Currently, the PCR-based methods are used for the detection of microorganisms in wastewater however these methods are not portable and requires technical skills to conduct the assays. In addition, PCR-based methods take longer from test to result and there are increased costs associated with the transport of samples to off-site laboratories that have PCR equipment.
The paper based dipstick has been designed to develop qualitative or quantitative rapid test systems for simultaneous detection of two different pathogens. 
We have demonstrated this technology to Melbourne Water (MW) and MW has shown a strong interest in investing in either as a co-developer or investor.
• As requested by MW a detailed non-confidential brief with various investment/business models has been developed and shared with MW.
• However, Melbourne Water has further asked for a detailed Business plan with a comprehensive IP position on this technology."
"Design of a wire cut EDM end-effector with strict robotic constraints Electric Discharge Machining; Wire; Tool Wear Wire Electric Discharge Machining (WEDM) stands out as a non-contact and nearly force-free machining technique able to cut complex workpieces, delivering dimensional accuracy and superior surface finishing, especially for exotic super-hard materials. On the other hand, machining with six-axis industrial robots (IR) has received much attention due to its notorious advantages over CNC machines to deliver cost efficiency, large envelope, and complex tool kinematics. However, robot machining suffers from severe limitations regarding the tool payload, chatter, repeatability, accuracy error, complex programming and frequently poor surface finishing. This paper investigates the benefits of combining a robot with WEDM to exploit the advantages of both techniques. However, the new system design is not trivial and will involve a transdisciplinary approach and inventive problem solving to design and control a WEDM end-effector. The present study adopts the TRIZ algorithm approach to design a novel WEDM end-effector and define actions to be taken to achieve a flexible and accurate robotic machining system for hard-to-cut materials."

"Assessing multi-climate-hazard threat in the coastal region of Bangladesh by combining influential environmental and anthropogenic factors Bangladesh; Cyclonic Storms; Disaster This study developed a geo-spatial framework for assessing multi-hazard threat on the Bangladesh coast, integrating environmental hazards (EH), geo-environmental attributes (GA), and anthropogenic modifications (AM) based on their potential contribution to overall threat. For this purpose, a fuzzy logic based analytical technique was integrated with geospatial mapping. Thematic layers were prepared for twenty-three theoretically important factors representing the three components of threat. The spatial variations of threat and its components were delineated through spatial overlaying of the respective layers in a GIS environment. The final threat map revealed 32% (5338 km2) and 4% (646 km2) of the area of the western deltaic coast, which encompassed >50â€“60% of the areas of Khulna, Bagerhat, and Satkhira districts, was under high and very high threat, respectively, owing primarily to frequent cyclones, salinity ingression, and subsidence, and secondarily to the low elevation of the coast, high astronomical tide, shallow bathymetry, excessive groundwater extraction, and polder construction. High and very high threat zones within the central estuarine coast corresponded to 27% (4518 km2) and 16% (2618 km2) of the area, including most of Bhola, Barguna, and Patuakhali districts, which was attributable to the effects of coastal erosion, sea-level rise, flooding and the ancillary effects of strong wave action, high river discharge, deforestation, and land transformation. Around 14% (948 km2) and 3% (164 km2) of the eastern cliff coast, comprising the southwestern part of the Coxsbazar district, was found to be under high and very high threat, respectively, due to the direct effects of sea-level rise, storm surge, erosion, and indirect effects of closeness to the shoreline, alluvial composition of the beach, tourism, and pollution from industries. The outcomes of this study could guide the coastal managers of Bangladesh in prioritizing actions aimed at disaster risk reduction and sustainable development of this region."

"Towards an Optimal Outdoor Advertising Placement: When a Budget Constraint Meets Moving Trajectories Viral Marketing; Information Diffusion; Twitter In this article, we propose and study the problem of trajectory-driven influential billboard placement: given a set of billboards U (each with a location and a cost), a database of trajectories T, and a budget L, we find a set of billboards within the budget to influence the largest number of trajectories. One core challenge is to identify and reduce the overlap of the influence from different billboards to the same trajectories, while keeping the budget constraint into consideration. We show that this problem is NP-hard and present an enumeration based algorithm with (1-1/e) approximation ratio. However, the enumeration would be very costly when |U| is large. By exploiting the locality property of billboards' influence, we propose a partition-based framework PartSel. PartSel partitions U into a set of small clusters, computes the locally influential billboards for each cluster, and merges them to generate the global solution. Since the local solutions can be obtained much more efficiently than the global one, PartSel would reduce the computation cost greatly; meanwhile it achieves a non-trivial approximation ratio guarantee. Then we propose a LazyProbe method to further prune billboards with low marginal influence, while achieving the same approximation ratio as PartSel. Next, we propose a branch-and-bound method to eliminate unnecessary enumerations in both PartSel and LazyProbe, as well as an aggregated index to speed up the computation of marginal influence. Experiments on real datasets verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods."

"Planning for sustainable stakeholder engagement based on the assessment of conflicting interests in projects Green Building; Construction Industry; Project Delivery The absence or lack of effective stakeholder engagement during project life cycle, especially at the earlier stages of planning and implementation often negatively impacts the expected performance of projects. These coupled consequences of the lack of contextual knowledge from the stakeholders as well as lack of their support in the field necessitates effective stakeholder engagement. However, this integration faces challenges such as limitations of project resources and conflicting interests of the stakeholders. In this sense, project resources can be allocated based on the priorities of the fields of conflicts to facilitate stakeholder engagement of the projects. The goal of this paper is to provide a framework to enhance effectiveness of the stakeholder engagement in projects by systematically ranking the potential conflicts while combining the viewpoints of stakeholders and project management team. For this purpose, we draw on stakeholder theory, value-based management, matrix-based dependency modeling, and Total Quality Management to develop a stakeholder engagement framework while considering fuzzy inputs for reflecting the ambiguities at the project life cycle. The proposed approach is then applied to plan stakeholder engagement in case of a green building project in Iran. Practically, application of the proposed framework facilitates stakeholder engagement for project managers in line with sustainable goals through early assessment of the fields of potential conflicts of interests."

"Zero energy in the built environment: A holistic understanding Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building International pressures through global agreements such as the recent Paris agreement in 2015 have put stress on governments and industries to find lasting solutions for the built environment. The built environment was recognized as an important factor in reducing global emissions for the first time at the Conference of Parties (COP) 21 meeting in Paris through a dedicated 'Buildings Day.' The Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC) was also launched at COP 21 as a network to globally support zero emission, efficient and resilient buildings and construction sector. The Paris Agreement brought all nations to collectively combat climate change with a view to limit temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees Celsius (Â°C). Nations agreed to report their efforts through the monitoring program. In most countries, residential and commercial buildings spend a large proportion of their energy in lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning and in various appliances requiring energy for operation. This paper takes a broad understanding of zero energy. Starting with buildings, the definitions also consider understanding zero energy and from a carbon perspective, considering going from beyond buildings to include precincts and cities. The paper brings an understanding of zero energy, its importance, and its urgency with respect to global commitments to reduce the impact of the building and construction sector and the role of governments and industries in supporting the lowering of emissions in the built environment now and in the future."

"Omics-based ecosurveillance uncovers the influence of estuarine macrophytes on sediment microbial function and metabolic redundancy in a tropical ecosystem Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus Vertical zonation within estuarine ecosystems can strongly influence microbial diversity and function by regulating competition, predation, and environmental stability. The degree to which microbial communities exhibit horizontal patterns through an estuary has received comparatively less attention. Here, we take a multi-omics ecosurveillance approach to study environmental gradients created by the transition between dominant vegetation types along a near pristine tropical river system (Wenlock River, Far North Queensland, Australia). The study sites included intertidal mudflats fringed by saltmarsh, mangrove or mixed soft substrata habitats. Collected sediments were analyzed for eukaryotes and prokaryotes using small sub-unit (SSU) rRNA gene amplicons to profile the relative taxonomic composition. Central carbon metabolism metabolites and other associated organic polar metabolites were analyzed using established metabolomics-based approaches, coupled with total heavy metals analysis. Eukaryotic taxonomic information was found to be more informative of habitat type. Bacterial taxonomy and community composition also showed habitat-specificity, with phyla Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria strongly linked to mangroves and saltmarshes, respectively. In contrast, metabolite profiling was critical for understanding the biochemical pathways and expressed functional outputs in these systems that were tied to predicted microbial gene function (16S rRNA). A high degree of metabolic redundancy was observed in the bacterial communities, with the metabolomics data suggesting varying degrees of metabolic criticality based on habitat type. The predicted functions of the bacterial taxa combined with annotated metabolites accounted for the conservative perspective of microbial community redundancy against the putative metabolic pathway impacts in the metabolomics data. Coupling these data demonstrates that habitat-mediated estuarine gradients drive patterns of community diversity and metabolic function and highlights the real redundancy potential of habitat microbiomes. This information is useful as a point of comparison for these sensitive ecosystems and provides a framework for identifying potentially vulnerable or at-risk systems before they are significantly degraded."

"Press Freedom and the Global Economy: The Cost of Slipping Backwards Mediatization; Journalists; News This article examines the effects of press freedom (as defined by the US-based Freedom House) on economic growth for 97 countries over four decades (1972â€“2014). Acknowledging that the idea of â€œpress freedomâ€ carries with it a weight of ethnocentric assumptions, our empirical analysis finds that US understandings of deterioration in press freedom are detrimental to a nationâ€™s economy. Further, we find that countries do not fully recover economically if their press freedoms are compromised, even if the rights of media are restored. This is consistent with emerging literature highlighting the suppressive long-term effects censorship may exert on citizen desire for a free press. We find that the relationship between press freedom and economic performance varies, particularly depending upon the education level of a nationâ€™s workforce, which is consistent with notions that education can be linked to a demand for a free press."

"Exploring privacy paradox in contact tracing apps adoption Privacy Concerns; Online Shopping; Electronic Commerce Purpose: Understanding the privacy concerns of individuals in the adoption of contact tracing apps is critical for the successful control of pandemics like COVID-19. This paper explores the privacy paradox in the adoption of contact tracing apps in Australia. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive review of the related literature has been conducted, leading to the development of a conceptual model based on the privacy calculus theory and the antecedent-privacy concern-outcome framework. Such a model is then tested and validated using structural equation modelling on the survey data collected in Australia. Findings: The study shows that perceived benefit, perceived privacy risk and trust have significant influences on the adoption of contact tracing apps. It reveals that personal innovativeness and trust have significant and negative influences on perceived privacy risk. The study further finds out that personal innovativeness is insignificant to perceived benefit. It states that perceived ease of use has an insignificant influence on perceived privacy risk in the adoption of contact tracing apps. Originality/value: This study is the first attempt to use the privacy calculus theory and the antecedentâ€“privacy concernâ€“outcome framework for exploring the privacy paradox in adopting contact tracing apps. This leads to a better understanding of the privacy concerns of individuals in the adoption of contact tracing apps. Such an understanding can help formulate targeted strategies and policies for promoting the adoption of contact tracing apps and inform future epidemic control through effective contact tracing for better emergency management."

"GreenFog: A Framework for Sustainable Fog Computing Edge Computing; Internet Of Things; Location Awareness The alarming rate of increase in energy demand and carbon footprint of Fog environments has become a critical issue. It is, therefore, necessary to reduce the percentage of brown energy consumption in these systems and integrate renewable energy use into Fog. Renewables, however, are prone to availability fluctuations due to their variable and intermittent nature. In this paper, we propose a new Fog framework and design various optimization techniques, including linear programming optimization, linear regression estimation, and Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) learning to optimize renewable energy use in the Fog based on a novel idea of load shaping with adaptive Quality of Service (QoS). The proposed framework, along with the optimization techniques, are tested on a real-world micro data center (Fog environment) powered by solar energy sources connected to multiple IoT devices. The results show that our proposed framework significantly reduces the difference between renewable energy generation and total energy consumption while efficiently adjusting the QoS of applications."
"Mixed-dimensional heterostructures of hydrophobic/hydrophilic graphene foam for tunable hydrogen evolution reaction Catalyst; Cobalt Phosphide; Water Splitting The synergetic effect of hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbon can be used to obtain tunable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the interface. Herein, graphene oxide (GO-Hummers method) was coated on graphene foam (GF) synthesized via chemical vapor deposition to develop mixed-dimensional heterostructure for the observation of HER. The porosity of GF not only provides an optimized diffusion coefficient for better mass transport but also modified surface chemistry (GF/GO-hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface), which results in an onset potential 50 mV and overpotential of 450 mV to achieve the current density 10 mA/cm2. The surface analysis shows that inherent functional groups at the surface played a key role in tuning the activity of hybrid, providing a pathway to introduce non-corrosive electrodes for water splitting."

"Options for Improved Treatment of Saline Wastewater From Fish and Shellfish Processing Activated Sludge; Batch Reactors; Salinity The rapid growth of the aquaculture industry over recent decades, with annual production reaching 94.6 million tonnes in 2018 has resulted in a significant increase in saline wastewater following the use of seawater in both fish and shellfish production and processing. This wastewater contains high concentrations of nutrients, organic compounds, and total nitrogen, resulting in the requirement for significant treatment prior to discharge to meet environmental regulations, which are becoming more stringent. The infrastructure and running costs associated with physico-chemical treatment approaches are generally higher than the implementation of biological approaches; the latter represents both an economic and sustainable technology. However, salinity represents a significant inhibitor to microbial activity, affecting the efficacy of the biological treatment of wastewater. This review aims to 1) identify the major biodegradable components in saline fish wastewater that may result in deleterious effects upon discharge, 2) discuss the current methods used for the treatment of fish processing wastewaters, and 3) identify opportunities for improved processes to be utilised and identify gaps in knowledge that require further research. Total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total nitrogen (TN) were found to be the most prevalent components in fish effluent. High concentrations of TSS and TN are likely due to the protein content. One method for reducing the environmental impact of the treated wastewater is to enhance nutrient removal (TSS, TN, BOD) through process modification, leading to an increase in active proteolytic activity. Bioaugmentation using immobilised, saline-tolerant proteases or halophilic, protease-producing microorganisms have both shown significant potential in laboratory studies in reducing both the COD and TN content of fish processing wastewater to below discharge limits and therefore may represent commercial options for future treatment processes."

"Does daily commuting behavior matter to employee productivity? Commute; Bicycling; Travel This study is the first of its kind to explore the relationship between commuting behavior and employee productivity by drawing theories from multiple disciplines and providing empirical evidence from Australian cities. Relying on survey data collected from three major cities in Australia, this study finds that commuting distance is positively associated with absenteeism. This study also finds a positive association between active commuting (i.e., travel to work by walking or bicycling) and job performance in the middle-aged employees. The structural equation model further explored possible causal pathways from commuting to employee productivity, and the results reveal that commuting mode choices and commuting distance influence absenteeism and job performance through affecting commuting satisfaction and personal health, though commuting distance retains a direct impact on absenteeism after controlling for the indirect effects. In particular, the results suggest that the happy commuters are more productive, and the short-distance and active travel commuters are more likely to be the happy commuters. Overall, these findings support that commuting behaviors of employees influence their productivity at the workplace. Encourage active commuting not only improves the physical health of employees, but may also enhance their job performance, contributing to the economic benefits to employers and society."

"Understanding Australia's national feral cat control effort Dingoes; Mammals; Vulpes Vulpes Context. Feral cats (Felis catus) pose a significant threat to Australia's native species and feral cat control is, therefore, an important component of threatened species management and policy. Australia's Threatened Species Strategy articulates defined targets for feral cat control. Yet, currently, little is known about who is engaged in feral cat control in Australia, what motivates them, and at what rate they are removing feral cats from the environment. Aims. We aim to document who is engaging in feral cat control in Australia, how many cats they remove and to estimate the number of feral cats killed in a single year. Furthermore, we seek to better understand attitudes towards feral cat control in Australia. Methods. We used a mixed methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative techniques. Feral cat control data were obtained from existing data repositories and via surveys targeting relevant organisations and individuals. A bounded national estimate of the number of feral cats killed was produced by combining estimates obtained from data repositories and surveys with modelled predictions for key audience segments. Attitudes towards feral cat control were assessed by exploring qualitative responses to relevant survey questions. Key results. We received information on feral cat control from three central repositories, 134 organisations and 2618 individuals, together removing more than 35 000 feral cats per year. When including projections to national populations of key groups, the estimated number of feral cats removed from the environment in the 2017-2018 financial year was 316 030 (95% CI: 297 742-334 318). Conclusions. Individuals and organisations make a significant, and largely unrecorded, contribution to feral cat control. Among individuals, there is a strong awareness of the impact of feral cats on Australia's biodiversity. Opposition to feral cat control focussed largely on ethical concerns and doubts about its efficacy. Implications. There is significant interest in, and commitment to, feral cat control among some groups of Australian society, beyond the traditional conservation community. Yet more information is needed about control methods and their effectiveness to better understand how these efforts are linked to threatened species outcomes."

"Understanding what attracts new residents to smaller cities (Administered by University of South Australia) Australia's long term population growth strategy has prioritised major state capitals as the centres of growth. Between
2016-2066 the Australian population is project to increase by 24.6 million poeople and 55% of this growth is likely to
occur in Melbourne and Sydney.
The largest cities are already under great strain, as reflected in high levels of road congestion and expensive local
housing markets. Sydney and Melbourne account for roughly 75% of all road congestion across major cities in Australia
and New Zealand.
More dispersed population growth strategies that encourage development of regional centres could help alleviate some
of these urban pressures. However for these strategies to succeed, the recent decline in population growth in regional
areas (due to an ageing population and as young adults move away to find jobs or pursue education), needs to be
reversed.
This project will examine the key drivers of migration flows and settlement patterns across Australia, and identify key
barriers to and opportunities for greater population decentralisation.

"Estimate Forest Biomass Dynamics Using Multi-Temporal Lidar and Single-Date Inventory Data Lidar; Tree Crown; Canopy Height Estimating change in forest biomass is important for monitoring carbon dynamics and understanding the global carbon cycle. Multi-temporal airborne lidar data has been recently used to accurately predict change in forest attributes such as aboveground biomass (AGB). In this study, we assessed the ability of multi-temporal airborne lidar (2008 and 2016) and single-date inventory data to estimate forest biomass dynamics. To do so, we compared different imputation approaches to predict biomass, specifically direct (i.e., a model trained by the biomass variable or AGB) and indirect (i.e., a model trained by structure variables - basal area, tree volume and stem density) approaches. We also evaluated the ability of the selected model in temporally estimating biomass by relating biomass predictions with forest disturbance data. Our results demonstrated that AGB can be better predicted using an indirect imputation method in which lidar metrics were trained by a structure variable (basal area, RMSE = 95.09, R2 = 0.89). While the model was developed for the date of inventory measurements (2016), the model was successfully applied to predict biomass for a historical date (2008). For both years, biomass predictions were highly consistent with disturbance history. This study further informs the benefits of multi-temporal lidar data to estimate forest biomass dynamics in instances when only single-date inventory data are available. The work thus can support forest researchers and managers in improving their scientific and practical tasks in forest management."

"Local urban climate governance in Nepal: The interplay between national governments and aid agencies Aid; Official Development Assistance; International Cooperation Multi-lateral aid come from various Bilateral-aid agencies that play a crucial role in supporting developing nations around the world to address climate change issues. Despite significant effort from aid agencies, it is not clear how aid is received and distributed at local level in recipient countries. This paper highlights some of the challenges associated with funding obtained and utilised particularly to address climate change adaptation via case study of Kathmandu, Nepal. This empirical research is funded by the Government of Australia. This research draws on PhD research including a review of the literature and in-depth interviews with governing actors such as local planners in Kathmandu, climate experts, academics, and community members. The study focused on understanding the impacts of international and aid agency investment in climate action at the local urban scale. Key findings reveal that over the past decade significant resources were spent in capacity building programs nationally, but with limited contribution at the level of local adaptation in the urban regions. Local governing agencies and authorities have little capacity to address urban scale needs. Results of the study suggest that the process of distributing aid funding and evaluation of its impact is not transparent. This raised a number of questions around the legitimacy of governing climate change adaptation programs from the top down."

"Characterization of Novel Moss Biomass, Bryum dichotomum Hedw. as Solid Fuel Feedstock Biofuel; Nannochloropsis; Chlorella Sorokiniana Due to the overuse of natural gas and petroleum in Bangladesh, the excessive greenhouse gas (GHG) emission continuously worsens the countriesâ€™ air quality. To resolve this environmental concern as well as determine the sustainable bioenergy sources, research on biomass for biofuel production has been highlighted recently. Therefore, this study emphasized to identify a novel biomass for solid fuel generation as well as designed a pilot-scale biofuel production scheme. The study endeavoured to characterize the bioenergy properties of a novel wetland moss species, B. dichotomum Hedw., collected from rainforest of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), Bangladesh. Current study also presented the morphological edifice and elemental composition through scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Gross and net calorific values of moss were determined through bomb calorimeter by standard method, and they were 10.77 and 9.35 MJ kgâˆ’1, respectively. Moisture content, ash content, volatile matter, fixed carbon, and bulk density were characterized on air-dried basis through standard ASTM methods, and the outcomes were 10.74%, 55.3%, 28.29%, 5.67% and 44.09 kg mâˆ’3, respectively. Other physical bioenergy parameters were biomass characteristics index 3936 kg mâˆ’3, energy density 0.475 GJ mâˆ’3 and fuel value index 5.07. Apart from that, experimental results revealed carbon element 56.6%, oxygen content 42.1% on dry weight basis and O/C ratio 0.74 in sample biomass."
"Mining in Papua New Guinea: A complex story of trends, impacts and governance Papua New Guinea; Resource Extraction; Mining Mining is often portrayed as a contributor to sustainable development, especially so in developing countries such as Papua New Guinea (PNG). Since 1970, several large mines have been developed in PNG (e.g. Panguna, Ok Tedi, Porgera, Lihir, Ramu) but always with controversial environmental standards and social impacts often overlooked or ignored. In PNG, mine wastes are approved to be discharged to rivers or oceans on a very large scale, leading to widespread environmental and social impacts â€“ to the point of civil war in the case of Panguna. The intimate links between indigenous communities and their environment have invariably been under-estimated or ignored, leading many to question mining's role in PNG's development. Here, we review the geology of PNG, its mineral resources, mining history, key trends for grades and resources, environmental metrics (water, energy, carbon), mine waste management, and regulatory and governance issues. The study provides a unique and comprehensive insight into the sustainable development contribution of the mining industry in PNG â€“ especially the controversial practices of riverine and marine mine waste disposal. The history of mining is a complex story of the links between the anthroposphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and geosphere. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that the scale of environmental and social impacts and risks are clearly related to the vast scale of mine wastes â€“ a fact which remains been poorly recognised. For PNG, the promise of mining-led development remains elusive to many communities and they are invariably left with significant social and environmental legacies which will last for decades to centuries (e.g. mine waste impacts on water resources). Most recently, the PNG government has moved to ban riverine tailings disposal for future projects and encourage greater transparency and accountability by the mining sector, including its interactions with communities. There remains hope for better outcomes in the future."

"Catalytic upgrading of holocellulose-derived C5 and C6 sugars Biomass; Levulinic Acids; Ethyl Levulinate Biorefineries are a new concept in chemical manufacturing in which naturally occurring, sustainable biomass resources such as forestry and agricultural waste are converted to diverse fuel and chemical product streams, akin to the processing of non-renewable fossil fuels by petrochemical refineries. Polysaccharides are attractive potential feedstocks for biorefineries, with the transformation of C5 and C6 sugars offering routes to the production of fine, bulk, and platform chemicals typically produced via petrochemical routes. The transformation of biomass-derived building blocks will require different processes to those currently employed in the petrochemical industry, wherein highly functional biomolecules are selectively deoxygenated to their target product, which requires new classes of catalyst that are compatible with hydrophilic, bulky substrates. Here, we review recent advances in the design and development of catalysts and processes for C5-C6 sugar reforming into chemical intermediates and products and highlight the challenges of aqueous phase operation and catalyst evaluation, in addition to process considerations such as solvent and reactor selection."

The absorber is made of three metallic layers separated from each other using low-loss cyclic olefin copolymer as dielectric spacers. A high quality factor ($Q$) is obtained using a first-order resonating structure with additional capacitive loading formed by the top two metallic layers. A circuit model is developed for the analysis and design of the proposed absorber. The designed absorber shows $\text{1}\%$ fractional bandwidth for more than $\text{90}\%$ absorption around a center frequency of 0.5 THz under normal incidence angle. This is equivalent to a quality factor of $Q=31$, calculated at $\text{50}\%$ absorbance. The structure shows a highly stable absorbance over a wide range of oblique incidence angles. The designed absorber has been fabricated using a microfabrication process. The measured results of the fabricated prototype are in good agreement with the simulations."

"Mechanisms underlying exposure to partner violence and children's emotional-behavioral difficulties Adverse Childhood Experiences; Maltreatment; Child Abuse Intimate partner violence (IPV) between parents can have a serious impact on children's health, well-being, and development. This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal associations between exposure to IPV in the first year postpartum and children's emotional-behavioral well-being at age 10 years, where maternal depressive symptoms and involvement in home learning activities at 4 years mediate this relationship. A second aim was to test for the moderating effects of child gender and economic disadvantage. Data were drawn from 1,385 Australian mothers and children participating in the Maternal Health Study; a prospective longitudinal study of women's health after childbirth. Results revealed that IPV in the first year postpartum was associated with higher maternal depressive symptoms at 4 years postpartum, which was, in turn, associated with children's emotional-behavioral difficulties at age 10 years. These associations remained significant after adjusting for concurrent exposure to IPV and maternal depressive symptoms at 10 years. There was no evidence of moderation by child gender, but there was for economic disadvantage. The associations between early life exposure to IPV, maternal depressive symptoms, and children's emotional-behavioral difficulties were stronger for families experiencing economic disadvantage, while the associations between IPV, maternal involvement, and children's emotional-behavioral difficulties were stronger for those not experiencing disadvantage. These findings can inform prevention and early intervention practices and policies aimed at providing adequate mental health support to women experiencing IPV to minimize the negative impact on children."

"Fertility gap and child nutrition: Evidence from India Birth Rate; Childlessness; Postponement Using data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) of India, the authors examine the impact of fertility gap on child nutritional outcomes, focused on whether a child is stunted, wasted or anemic. They find that the odds of having malnourished children who are stunted, wasted or anemic are higher for women who exceed their fertility target compared to those who have achieved or underachieved it. The authors build on the literature that has emphasized the importance of lower fertility on development, and thus calls for policies that are aimed at achieving this."
"Geopolitical risk and bank stability Oil Price Shocks; Oil Markets; Petroleum In this paper, we present evidence supporting our hypothesis that geopolitical risk hurts bank stability. Using annual bank stability, bank-specific, macroeconomic, and geopolitical risk datasets, we show that an increase in geopolitical risk is associated with a decline in bank stability. This finding is robust to different geopolitical risk and bank stability measures, removing the period of extreme financial events, excluding banks with less than ten years of data, potential endogeneity issues, and controlling for other risk factors. Our results also emphasize the role of holding capital and bank size in attenuating the destabilizing effect of geopolitical risk."

"Porous crystalline frameworks for thermocatalytic CO2reduction: An emerging paradigm Metal-Organic Frameworks; N(1)-Methyl-2-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide; Zirconium Heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 reduction derived from porous, crystalline frameworks have emerged as efficient systems with comparable activity and superior selectivity to their inorganic counterparts. The spatial arrangement of active sites in such catalytically active frameworks is critical to their performance in CO2 reduction. This review presents a comprehensive and critical analysis of (thermal) CO2 reduction over catalysts derived from porous, crystalline frameworks, whose structural and chemical diversity offers unprecedented opportunities to regulate reactivity. Thermodyamic considerations and the impact of process parameters on reaction intermediates, governing mechanisms for CO2 reduction and catalyst stability are discussed. Strategies for leveraging the flexibility of porous, crystalline frameworks to improve their stability and promote CO2 reduction are presented which include: use as sacrificial precursors to an active phase; integration within composites; and as hosts for nanoparticle encapsulation. Finally, future challenges and research prospects are highlighted."

"Leaf my neighbourhood alone! predicting the influence of densification on residential tree canopy cover in Perth Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Trees provide myriad ecosystem services of benefit to urban populations; however, urban development is pressuring existing urban tree coverage. Thus, a pertinent challenge for planners is identifying development scenarios that find synergies between urban growth and the preservation or enhancement of tree canopy coverage. This paper presents the training and validation of a model that predicts changes in neighbourhood-level urban tree canopy cover associated with different socio-economic and physical urban form variables. Neighbourhoods across Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, were used as a case study. A Random Forests model was trained using a suite of socio-economic and urban form variables and neighbourhood percentage tree canopy cover derived from very high resolution multispectral remote sensing images and digital surface models. This model was validated using independent test data with a mean absolute error of 1.78% and a root mean square error of 2.42%. An application of this model was demonstrated using the City of Nedlands, Perth, where a new planning scheme allowing denser urban development has been approved by the State Government. The magnitude and spatial variation in the change of neighbourhood tree canopy cover in the City of Nedlands in 2050 associated with three urban development scenarios was predicted using the model."

"Good regulation versus bad regulation Derivative Markets; Financial Markets; Bankruptcy Code The debate on regulation typically revolves around the quantity of regulation and the choice between regulation and deregulation. While the global financial crisis has taught us that regulation is necessary, this does not mean that regulation cannot be counterproductive. Good regulation is any regulation that reduces the extent of fraud and corruption in the financial sector without imposing excessively high costs on the society. Several examples of good regulation and bad regulation are discussed."

"Mali and Bougainville: new perspectives on international engagement in complex, heterogeneous security environments This project aims to contribute to more realistic, nuanced and ultimately more effective international engagement in complex, heterogeneous security and socio-political contexts. It does this through a study of conflict resolution, understood broadly (Ramsbotham et al 2011) in Mali and Bougainville (a region of Papua New Guinea), drawing on practice-informed theoretical insights from critical security and peace and conflict studies (e.g., Mac Ginty & Richmond 2016; Boege et al, 2009). These two cases are different in many respects. Both, however, are heterogeneous security contexts, characterised by complex interaction and interdependence among different forms of social and political order, and different providers of conflict resolution and security. State and traditional or
indigenous authorities are leading security and conflict resolution actors, but there are others that fit neatly into neither category. Both Mali and Bougainville are also on the UN Security Council agenda.
After being earlier touted as an example of a successful multi-ethnic state, Mali in the grip of a multilayered conflict without a clear way forward; Bougainville approaches a vote on independence from PNG against an earlier war of secession, followed by two decades of peacebuilding. Neither Mali nor Bougainville, at contrasting points in the `conflict cycle?, are fixed in conditions of violence or relative
peace, however, and both have much to say to each other and to international actors such as the UN regarding seeking and sustaining peace in complex, highly heterogeneous socio-political contexts."

"Happy feet in a hostile world? The future of penguins depends on proactive management of current and expected threats Penguin; Eudyptes; Aptenodytes Forsteri Penguins face a wide range of threats. Most observed population changes have been negative and have happened over the last 60 years. Today, populations of 11 penguin species are decreasing. Here we present a review that synthesizes details of threats faced by the world's 18 species of penguins. We discuss alterations to their environment at both breeding sites on land and at sea where they forage. The major drivers of change appear to be climate, and food web alterations by marine fisheries. In addition, we also consider other critical and/or emerging threats, namely human disturbance near nesting sites, pollution due to oil, plastics and chemicals such as mercury and persistent organic compounds. Finally, we assess the importance of emerging pathogens and diseases on the health of penguins. We suggest that in the context of climate change, habitat degradation, introduced exotic species and resource competition with fisheries, successful conservation outcomes will require new and unprecedented levels of science and advocacy. Successful conservation stories of penguin species across their geographical range have occurred where there has been concerted effort across local, national and international boundaries to implement effective conservation planning."

"Defining HIV reservoirs in the central nervous system In this study a comprehensive quantitative and phenotypic analysis of HIV-infected cell populations in distinct CNS
and non-CNS tissues obtained from chronically HIV-infected individuals will be performed in order to determine HIV
persistence in the CNS and inform HIV cure strategies. To this end we have compiled one of the largest tissue
banks of matched CNS and non-CNS tissue from HIV-infected individuals in Australia (n=80). Tissue from CNS and
non-CNS regions will be assessed by immunohistochemistry/hybridisation methods for cells containing viral DNA
and/or RNA using highly novel and sophisticated DNA/RNAscope platforms. These methods offer significant
benefits over traditional qPCR based quantification methods as they provide information at a single cell level, thus
allowing for the specific cell types infected in the CNS to be assessed. Furthermore, they can be performed on
formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue.
Secondly, we will further characterise the potential replicative ability of HIV infected cells in the CNS by assessing
intact genomes as it has been reported that ~93% of proviruses in CD4+ T cell reservoirs, a major HIV reservoir in
the blood, are defective and contain large internal deletions/and or hypermutations at the HIV tat-rev splice junction
(Bruner Nat Med 2016). Thus, cells expressing HIV DNA/RNA will be further assessed using a unique newly
developed hybridisation technique BASEscope that identifies intact, and therefore potentially replication competent,
HIV RNA."
"Information asymmetry and credit rating: A quasi-natural experiment from China Sovereign Ratings; Credit Rating Agencies; Firm We examine how the issuer-paid incumbent credit rating agencies (CRAs) in China adjust their rating strategies in response to the 2010 entry of an independent credit rating agency, China Bond Rating (CBR) between 2006 and 2015. The business model that CBR employs is a combination of the public utility model and the investor-paid model. We find that the CBR's ratings coverage effectively reduced the information asymmetry in the Chinese corporate bond market. The evidence shows decreased ratings inflation and increased informativeness of rating change announcements by incumbent issuer-paid CRAs after CBR entered the market. The findings suggest that a firm's credibility is an important channel driving issuer-paid incumbent CRAsâ€™ strategic ratings. Our paper provides new information and insight into the debate of whether CRAs with alternative business models can alleviate the information asymmetry problem."

"Broadening research in gender and music practice Highbrow; Cultural Capital; Music This article builds on research about gender in music practice, concerned with skewed musical canons, ratios and quotas of gender representation, unfair treatment and power dynamics, and the exclusionary enmeshment with music technologies. The aim is to critically discuss what 'gender' is understood to be, how it has been studied and how gendered power has been challenged, in order to suggest new routes for research on gender and music practice. While we count ourselves among the scholars working in the field and critically investigate our own work as well as that of others, the article addresses some additional concerns to those of previous studies by examining how gender is ontologically constructed in these studies, how intersectional approaches can enrich analyses of gender in music practice and how the material dimensions of music practice can be actively addressed. The conclusions outline suggestions for broadening research in gender and music practice."
"Synchrotron X-Ray Radiation-Induced Bystander Effect: An Impact of the Scattered Radiation, Distance From the Irradiated Site and p53 Cell Status Bystander Effect; Microbeams; Low Drug Dose Synchrotron radiation, especially microbeam radiotherapy (MRT), has a great potential to improve cancer radiotherapy, but non-targeted effects of synchrotron radiation have not yet been sufficiently explored. We have previously demonstrated that scattered synchrotron radiation induces measurable Î³-H2AX foci, a biomarker of DNA double-strand breaks, at biologically relevant distances from the irradiated field that could contribute to the apparent accumulation of bystander DNA damage detected in cells and tissues outside of the irradiated area. Here, we quantified an impact of scattered radiation to DNA damage response in â€œnaÃ¯veâ€ cells sharing the medium with the cells that were exposed to synchrotron radiation. To understand the effect of genetic alterations in naÃ¯ve cells, we utilised p53-null and p53-wild-type human colon cancer cells HCT116. The cells were grown in two-well chamber slides, with only one of nine zones (of equal area) of one well irradiated with broad beam or MRT. Î³-H2AX foci per cell values induced by scattered radiation in selected zones of the unirradiated well were compared to the commensurate values from selected zones in the irradiated well, with matching distances from the irradiated zone. Scattered radiation highly impacted the DNA damage response in both wells and a pronounced distance-independent bystander DNA damage was generated by broad-beam irradiations, while MRT-generated bystander response was negligible. For p53-null cells, a trend for a reduced response to scattered irradiation was observed, but not to bystander signalling. These results will be taken into account for the assessment of genotoxic effects in surrounding non-targeted tissues in preclinical experiments designed to optimise conditions for clinical MRT and for cancer treatment in patients."

"“Seriously, Australia, why are you so stingy with Wi-Fi?”: customer satisfaction with Wi-Fi speed in Australian hotels and lessons for public Wi-Fi provision Social Media; Online Reviews; Brand Community Purpose: This paper aims to analyse whether the speed of Wi-Fi in hotels influences customer satisfaction with hotels and the implications of this for the provision of Wi-Fi by commercial and governmental bodies seeking to boost tourism. Design/methodology/approach: Regression analysis on data from Australian hotels (191 entries) and 111 responses to a national survey of local government authorities on public Wi-Fi (PWF) provision were combined with a literature review and content analysis of online reviews by hotel customers. Findings: If Wi-Fi quality rises by 1%, customer satisfaction with the hotel increases by 0.376/100 units. In the areas where hotel Wi-Fi is of better quality, PWF provided by the local government is also of better quality; the reverse statement is also true. Practical implications: Tourists value continuous access to Wi-Fi, whether provided by commercial or public bodies. It is imperative for hotels and local governments seeking to boost tourist activity to invest in quality Wi-Fi networks. However, to assist this, national policies should address spatial disparities in broadband infrastructure revealed in the study. Originality/value: This study looks beyond a conventional distinction between the private and public provision of Wi-Fi to examine the shared interests of industry and government in this essential component of tourist infrastructure. The study is unique in the English-speaking literature for its focus on the link between the quality of Wi-Fi provision and customer satisfaction, with original results and discussion providing a rationale for investing in quality Wi-Fi networks."
"Lipid-based nanocarriers for delivery of small interfering RNA for therapeutic use Lipid Nanoparticle; MEND; Small Interfering RNA Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) indicate the unprecedented versatility in silencing disease-causing genes. However, the therapeutic use of siRNA is limited by its inherent instability in serum and immunogenicity. Thus, to realize their full therapeutic potential, there is a growing need to develop an efficient siRNA delivery system that targets it towards the localized symptomatic sites. Consequently, nanosized lipid carriers have been utilized for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to improve their efficacy in clinical studies. In this review, we attempt to elaborate on the current improvements of chemically diverse lipid carriers for the delivery of siRNAs-based drugs across a wide range of diseases. Finally, we discuss the patents and clinical status of siRNA in lipid formulations, which continue to expand for years to come."

"Engaging with uncertainty and ambiguity through participatory 'Adaptive Pathways' approaches: Scoping the literature Robust Decision Making; Climate Change Adaptation; Uncertainty Analysis Climate change adaptation planning demands decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. Adaptive Pathways (AP) planning is receiving increased attention as a method to guide adaptation planning in the face of uncertainties. The approach has been most extensively developed and applied in large, well-funded contexts such as the Thames Barrier and Dutch Delta program. However, the development of AP planning has focused much less on the parallel need for engaging with the challenge of ambiguity - that there are diverse, sometimes contending, knowledges, values, and stakes involved. A more nascent body of work has been exploring ways of engaging with both the uncertainties and ambiguities of adaptation through various participatory approaches to AP planning. This paper sought to synthesise insights from this emerging work. Examining the peer-reviewed and grey literature identified eight cases from four countries across five different policy issues that provided details of how they approached diverse participation. Analysis of this small suite of cases provided some key insights for those seeking to use participatory approaches to AP planning to engage with the inherent uncertainties and (arguably necessary) ambiguities of adaptation. The paper concludes with a call for greater publication of details regarding how participatory approaches to methods such as AP planning have been undertaken not just what was undertaken."

"Spatially Aggregated Photovoltaic Power Prediction Using Wavelet and Convolutional Neural Networks Diffuse Solar Radiation; Clear Sky; Prediction Forecasting the power generation from intermittent renewable energy sources, such as Photovoltaic (PV) systems, is crucial for the reliable operations of power systems. In this paper, we consider the task of spatially aggregated PV power generation from large-scale, grid-connected and geographically dispersed PV sites. PV power generation data is highly uncertain, non-linear and non-stationary, making accurate forecasting very challenging. We present a new approach, Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks (WCNNs), by combining Wavelet Transformation (WT) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The WCNNs approach first applies time-invariant WT to decompose the highly fluctuating PV power time series into multiple components. It then predicts the approximation (i.e., low frequency smoothed time series) and details (i.e., high frequency random noise) using CNNs and linear regression, respectively. Extensive evaluation using a real dataset from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) shows that WCNNs is an effective approach and outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning models both with and without WT."

"Unresolved Complexity in Assessments of Mineral Resource Depletion and Availability Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals Considerations of mineral resource availability and depletion form part of a diverse array of sustainable development-oriented studies, across domains such as resource criticality, life cycle assessment and material flow analysis. Given the multidisciplinary nature of these studies, it is important that a common understanding of the complexity and nuances of mineral supply chains be developed. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of these assessment approaches and expand on several areas that are conceptually difficult to account for in these studies. These include the dynamic nature of relationships between reserves, resources, cut-off grades and ore grades; the ability to account for local economic, social and environmental factors when performing global assessments; and the role that technology improvements play in increasing the availability of economically extractable mineral resources. Advancing knowledge in these areas may further enhance the sophistication and interpretation of studies that assess mineral resource depletion or availability."
"Building a sustainable society: Construction, public procurement policy and ‘best practice’ in the european union Anthropocene; Unequal Exchange; Posthumanism Sustainability and sustainable development are political and essentially contested social phenomena. Despite this ambiguity, they continue to hold a central position as apolitical concepts in much of social science and policy making. In Europe, public procurement is increasingly used as a tool to reach sustainability, a fact that actualizes an inherent tension between politically charged objectives on the one hand, and technological processes and market logics on the other. Therefore, in this article, we investigate this tension by studying policies relating to sustainable public procurement of the built environment in the EU. We argue that governing any policy domain entails the construction and representation of particular policy problems. Hence, we focus on how the â€˜problemsâ€™ of sustainable public procurement are represented in EU policy guidance and best practice documents. Our analysis shows that these central policy documents are dominated by a problem representation where unsustainability is constructed as technical design flaws and market failure. This has the primary effect that it renders sustainable development as, primarily, a technical issue, and beyond politics. Therefore, we conclude that current policy reproduces â€˜weakâ€™ forms of sustainable development, where the practice is depoliticized and premised upon continued growth and innovation."

We empirically examine the relationship between energy poverty and housing tenure in Australia using HILDA survey data over the period 2005 to 2018. We employ objective, subjective and composite measures of energy poverty and control for other respondent and household covariates. Results from our study, which are robust to a suite of checks, suggest that being energy poor has a negative impact on homeownership and â€œrent to ownâ€ transition, and a positive impact on â€œown to rentâ€ transition. We conclude by discussing the policy implications of our study."

"Life cycle assessment of paper and plastic packaging waste in landfill, incineration, and gasification-pyrolysis Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste Global commodity prices for materials including paper and crude oil have slumped, lowering the value of recyclate, presenting new challenges for the Australian waste and recycling industry. This study assesses the environmental performance of managing (mixed paper and mixed plastic) recyclate in landfill, incineration and gasification-pyrolysis using life cycle assessment (LCA) for impacts including acidification, climate change, photochemical oxidation, and eutrophication potentials. The study finds environmental outcomes can be optimized by separately treating recyclate. Mixed paper treated in incineration or gasification-pyrolysis produces less greenhouse gas emissions than in landfill, whereas mixed plastic is best managed in landfill. The directional outcomes for other pollutants assessed were sensitive to the inclusion of credits from electricity production. The study is significant because waste management in Australia is now considering thermal treatment options, due to diminishing landfill capacities and perceived environmental benefits. Policy changes to waste management systems will benefit from having the ability to predict environmental outcomes based on particular waste types and materials."

"Multifunctional sandwich composites containing embedded lithium-ion polymer batteries under bending loads Carbon Fibers; Electrochemical Capacitors; Battery Multifunctional composites that combine high load-bearing properties and energy storage capacity have potential application in next-generation electric vehicles. The effect of high structural bending loads on the flexural properties and electrical energy storage capacity of sandwich composites containing lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) batteries embedded within the polymer foam core is explored in this paper. Three-point bend tests which induce failure by plastic indentation or cracking of the core are performed on sandwich composites containing single or multiple LiPo batteries. The bending properties of the sandwich material are not changed significantly by embedding batteries within the core. The energy storage capacity of the sandwich composite can be increased by inserting multiple batteries without adversely affecting the bending properties. Furthermore, the internal electrical resistance and capacity of the batteries is not degraded when the sandwich composites are damaged by high bending loads. The implications of the results for the design of light-weight multifunctional sandwich composites with high energy storage capacity are discussed."

"Suitability Prediction and Enhancement of Future Water Supply Systems in Barwon Region in Victoria, Australia Environmental Assessment; Landscape Fragmentation; China Intensive agricultural production accompanied by the climate change impacts in postColonial rural landscapes have continuously increased the demand for water resources and coastal areas, showing an unprecedented water supply crisis. By taking extreme weather conditions and rainfall events for future trends, a resilient water storage facility for the landscape requires the collaborative approach of natural systems and simulation modelling techniques to develop sustainable future scenarios. In this study, an ecological suitability model is used to identify potential sites for the construction of multi-purpose dams. As part of the model structure, multi factors are classified using the patterns of changing landscapes, and then weighted overlay analysis is conducted on a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. Compared to previous studies, this paper derives its principal impact parameters and projections based on historical land cover information. The suitability maps that are generated visually guide the geographical location of the multi-purpose dams and indicate the areas from highly suitable to least suitable, clarifying the possibility of building blue infrastructure alongside the waterways in west-central Barwon. The workflow proposes a resilient water system based on existing land characteristics and measures that future water storage capacity will be a valid increase of approximately 1.5 times. This strategy alleviates water scarcity during the dry season to benefit traditional agricultural activities. Digital calculations are utilized to demonstrate the feasibility of the experimental results, providing a methodology for regulating the distribution and supply of river flows throughout the year while retaining runoff in a hierarchical pattern at precipitation periods."

"‘Value flows’ between talent and their networks: a case study of international graduates working in Vietnam’s emerging economy Talent Management; Practical Implication; Succession Planning This paper explores issues relating to talent management in Vietnamâ€™s emerging market economy, particularly knowledge transfer, skills application, and linkage effects within and across firms. The paper offers the concept of â€˜valueâ€™ to consider employeesâ€™ knowledge, skills, and attributes, and â€˜value flowsâ€™ as the deployment of these resources. This value-based approach to talent management is illustrated using qualitative data collected from semi-structured interviews with Vietnamese international graduatesâ€™ and members of their employment networks. The focus on international graduates considers the Vietnamese governmentâ€™s policies of internationalisation of higher education as a strategic investment to improve the quality of human resources to meet the countryâ€™s socioeconomic development needs for global integration. The paper offers some implications for policies and practices to develop and harness talent in emerging economies like Vietnam."

"Identifying Unusual Charging Patterns of Electric Vehicles Using Artificial Intelligence Power System; State Estimation; Smart Grid Some of the most challenging parts of finding new approaches to lowering residential energy use involve studying, detecting, and visualizing households' anomalous power usage patterns. This research presents a novel method for identifying irregularities in electric vehicle energy use by extracting features using a modified long-short-Term memory model. The latter is implemented to extract load features by analysing intent-driven user consumption instances occurring throughout the day. In addition to feature extraction, we explore the use of a deep neural network, specifically the LSTM architecture, to efficiently detect and classify anomalies in Electric Vehicles.

"N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-conjugated PAMAM dendrimers as dual receptor-targeting nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery Polyamidoamine; Drug Delivery Systems; Dendrimers N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-labelled dendrimers (NAG-Dend) were synthesized for the targeted delivery of camptothecin (CPT) to A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells, which overexpress glucose transporters and lectin receptors. CPT loaded, NAG-Dend (NAG-Dend-CPT) exhibited more rapid and higher cellular uptake than the unlabelled dendrimer formulation (Dend-CPT), leading to enhanced cytotoxicity. Compared with native CPT, NAG-Dend-CPT was 4.5 times more toxic to A549 cells. The anticancer activity of the different CPT formulations was dose and time dependent. NAG-Dend-CPT also increased reactive oxygen species generation, induced higher apoptosis and showed greater inhibition of A549 cell migration than Dend-CPT. The selective accumulation of NAG-Dend in the lungs of tumour-bearing mice confirmed that the NAG-based dendrimer system can target lung metastasis tumours in a biological system. Overall, our results show that NAG-conjugated dendrimers could be a promising nanocarrier system for the delivery of anticancer drugs, including CPT, to human lung cancer cells."

"Diversification gains for a home biased trader in the emerging and frontier equity markets Volatility Spillover; Spillover; Comovement We study the case of a home-biased equity trader based in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, or Latin America, who is looking at diversifying his/her investment risks internationally within his/her region and three other emerging/frontier regions. We focus on explaining the dynamic conditional correlations between equity markets from 3 January 2002 to 11 November 2016. Timevarying opportunities for diversification are found in several nations across regions. However, diversification opportunities outside a region are largely reserved for bad times, such as during the global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis."
"Advances in transcriptomics of plants Argonaute Proteins; Gene; Nicotiana Benthamiana The current global population of 7.3 billion is estimated to reach 9.7 billion in the year 2050. Rapid population growth is driving up global food demand. Additionally, global climate change, environmental degradation, drought, emerging diseases, and salty soils are the current threats to global food security. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of these diverse agricultural productivity constraints and enhance crop yield and stress-tolerance in plants, we need to go beyond traditional and molecular plant breeding. The powerful new tools for genome editing, Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) and Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas systems (CRISPR-Cas9), have been hailed as a quantum leap forward in the development of stress-resistant plants. Plant breeding techniques, however, have several drawbacks. Hence, identification of transcriptional regulatory elements and deciphering mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation are crucial to avoiding unintended consequences in modified crop plants, which could ultimately have negative impacts on human health. RNA splicing as an essential regulated post-transcriptional process, alternative polyadenylation as an RNA-processing mechanism, along with non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, small interfering RNAs and long non-coding RNAs) have been identified as major players in gene regulation. In this chapter, we highlight new findings on the essential roles of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation in plant development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. We also discuss biogenesis and the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants and recent advances in our knowledge of the roles of miRNAs and siRNAs in plant stress response."

"Spatial characteristics of species distributions as drivers in conservation prioritization Conservation Planning; Reserve Design; Environmental Protection Spatial prioritization, based on the biogeographical identification of priority areas for conservation actions, is an important aspect of conservation planning. Although the influence of factors such as costs, threats or use of surrogates on the resulting priorities has been studied extensively, relatively little is known about how the spatial characteristics of species distributions drive the spatial pattern of priorities in multi-species conservation plans. Using datasets from Australia and Finland, we explore how excluding or including a given species changes spatial priorities in a multi-species prioritization. We develop three metrics to quantify changes in priorities, and explore how these changes depend on the total number of species used in the prioritization, the spatial characteristics of the given species distribution, and how species share their space with other species used in the prioritization. We randomly selected 12 set of 10 species from each dataset, and explore the influence of each of these species in prioritizations done for a total of 10, 20, 50 or 100 species. We show that spatial priorities become increasingly stable as the number of species is increased, and that the stability of highest and lowest priority areas behave differently. When less than 50 species were used in a prioritization, intermediately rare species that occupy mostly species-poor habitats tend to have the greatest influence on priorities, whereas very rare and common species that co-occur with many other species tend to have a small influence. Our results present a systematic method to explore the stability of spatial priorities to changes in the species pool used for a conservation plan. Although the analysed two datasets differed in data type, location, scale and species composition, they both showed how using a small number of species leads to unstable spatial solutions, where the choice to include or exclude an individual species can strongly influence the conservation outcome. Our results also show that conservation planners should carefully assess the use of spatial prioritizations for identifying least important areas (e.g. for development) as these can be particularly unstable when the prioritization is based on a small number of species."

"Domestic and International Drivers of the Demand for Water Resources in the Context of Water Scarcity: A Cross-Country Study Water Demand; Family Characteristic; End Use Global warming, while increasing human demand for water, is reducing water availability by reducing runoff flows and the effective amount of water between seasons, making water scarcity a growing problem globally. Water management plays an important role in mitigating global warming, improving the water cycle, reducing carbon emissions, and providing clean energy, and pricing water is considered a good approach to water management. Pricing water needs to take into account all sectors and aspects of society, such as domestic water, food and agriculture, energy, transport, industry, urban provision, human health, ecosystems, and the environment, and their interrelationships through water, within the context of the fundamental human rights to water and sanitation. This requires that every stakeholder should contribute to the development of water-related policies at every stage of the water interrelationship. This study investigated the relationship between water demand across different sectors of the economy using indicators for China, Australia, Japan, and the UK. Using panel analyses, this study finds that economic growth and population expansion increases the demand for water in all aspects. These findings have significant policy implications for water management. Because water prices can have an impact on global trade and, more importantly, are a major solution to global warming, water management policies should be considered at the global level, not only at the national level."

"Fabrication and Spectral Characteristics of Silicon Nanowires for Efficient Solar Energy Harvesting Silicon Nanowires; Silicon; Etching Solar cell utilizes a small portion of solar spectrum leaving higher energy (> band gap, Eg) as thermalization loss and lower energy (< band gap, Eg) as absorption loss. Wavelength-sensitive engineered absorbing layer such as nanometric absorber holds huge potential in this context. Here in this work, a simple and hands-on strategy was devised to grow silicon nanowires (Si-NWs) on silicon wafer. Nanoparticles were achieved in the first step and used as seeds to directed growth of Si-NWs. As-grown Si-NWs with coverage ca. 6.5 Ã— 108/cm2 were characterized through scanning electron microscope. To realize such Si-NWs as nanometric absorber in nanowire solar cell, a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulation has been carried out. Considering the possibility of Si-NWs of different diameters as observed in experimental investigations, Si-NW of 50-, 100-, and 150-nm diameters was chosen in simulation. Two specific wavelengths, 700 and 1100 nm, were in prime focus to understand the characteristics of exciton generation within Si-NW. Confinement in exciton generation rate distribution at 700-nm solar spectrum for Si-NW of 150 nm was found to be most effective, whereas at 1100-nm wavelength Si-NW of 100 nm showed higher exciton generation rate distribution with the nanowire. Exciton generation line profiles along the center and edge were extracted, and comparative analysis was carried out for different diameters of Si-NW at 700- and 1100-nm wavelengths. Such experimental and correlated simulation is indispensable not only to reduce costs but also to understand and improve the cell efficiency using the light-trapping technique."
"Towards the spectral mapping of plastic debris on beaches Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Floating and washed ashore marine plastic debris (MPD) is a growing environmental challenge. It has become evident that secluded locations including the Arctic, Antarctic, and remote islands are being impacted by plastic pollution generated thousands of kilometers away. Optical remote sensing of MPD is an emerging field that can aid in monitoring remote environments where in-person observation and data collection is not always feasible. Here we evaluate MPD spectral features in the visible to shortwave infrared regions for detecting varying quantities of MPD that have accumulated on beaches using a spectroradiometer. Measurements were taken from a range of in situ MPD accumulations ranging from 0.08% to 7.94% surface coverage. Our results suggest that spectral absorption features at 1215 nm and 1732 nm are useful for detecting varying abundance levels of MPD in a complex natural environment, however other absorption features at 931 nm, 1045 nm and 2046 nm could not detect in situ MPD. The reflectance of some in situ MPD accumulations was statistically different from samples that only contained organic debris and sand between 1.56% and 7.94% surface cover; however other samples with similar surface cover did not have reflectance that was statistically different from samples containing no MPD. Despite MPD being detectable against a background of sand and organic beach debris, a clear relationship between the surface cover of MPD and the strength of key absorption features could not be established. Additional research is needed to advance our understanding of the factors, such as type of MPD assemblage, that contribute to the bulk reflectance of MPD contaminated landscapes."

"The effect of parental smoking on children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills Locus of Control; Labour Market; Personality Traits Economic research emphasises the importance of cognitive and non-cognitive skills in children for long-term labour market, health and social outcomes. In contrast to previous studies that focus on the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy, we contribute to the literature by examining whether parental current smoking impacts on children's cognitive and non-cognitive development. We exploit data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children and address potential endogeneity and self-selectivity bias using robust estimation methods. Overall, we find evidence that parental smoking results in worse development outcomes in children. Specifically, our fixed-effects estimates indicate that children living with parents who are smokers exhibit lower cognitive outcomes ranging between 0.09 and 0.17 standard deviation, while the impacts on non-cognitive outcomes range between 0.06 and 0.80 standard deviation. We also provide insights on some of the mechanisms of transmission. Our findings suggest that campaigns, programs and policies that reduce tobacco consumption may have positive externalities in terms of improving children's cognitive and non-cognitive development, and long-term labour market outcomes."

"Tailoring Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction in a transition metal dichalcogenide by dual-intercalation Magnetic Bubbles; Magnetism; Domain Walls Dzyaloshinskiiâ€“Moriya interaction (DMI) is vital to form various chiral spin textures, novel behaviors of magnons and permits their potential applications in energy-efficient spintronic devices. Here, we realize a sizable bulk DMI in a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) 2H-TaS2 by intercalating Fe atoms, which form the chiral supercells with broken spatial inversion symmetry and also act as the source of magnetic orderings. Using a newly developed protonic gate technology, gate-controlled protons intercalation could further change the carrier density and intensely tune DMI via the Rudermanâ€“Kittelâ€“Kasuyaâ€“Yosida mechanism. The resultant giant topological Hall resistivity ÏxyT of 1.41 Î¼ Î© â‹… cm at Vg= âˆ’ 5.2 V (about 424 % larger than the zero-bias value) is larger than most known chiral magnets. Theoretical analysis indicates that such a large topological Hall effect originates from the two-dimensional Bloch-type chiral spin textures stabilized by DMI, while the large anomalous Hall effect comes from the gapped Dirac nodal lines by spinâ€“orbit interaction. Dual-intercalation in 2H-TaS2 provides a model system to reveal the nature of DMI in the large family of TMDs and a promising way of gate tuning of DMI, which further enables an electrical control of the chiral spin textures and related electromagnetic phenomena."

"The rise of defensive engineering: How personal liability considerations impact decision-making Flood Risk; Flood Risk Management; Community Rating Based on a survey of Australian engineers (n = 275) this paper examines the impact of personal liability considerations on engineering decision-making. Almost all respondents who make high-stakes decisions saw questions of liability as having both positive (90%) and negative (87%) impacts. Our analysis shows that awareness of personal liability acts to focus the attention of many engineers on the moral dimension of their work. However, it also encourages more expensive decision-making, inhibition of innovation and professional paralysis. We argue that while personal legal liability is a legitimate way to focus engineersâ€™ attention on the potential impact of their work, a problem arises when decision-makers are held responsible for disasters over which they had little control. The focus then shifts to â€˜defensive engineeringâ€™ practices that are aimed at limiting individual liability rather than disaster prevention. Legal processes that are seen to unfairly allocate blame do not encourage practices that support future disaster prevention."

"Impacts of China's crash on Asia-Pacific financial integration: Volatility interdependence, information transmission and market co-movement Volatility Spillover; Spillover; Comovement This paper examines the price and volatility dynamics between China and major stock markets in the Asia-Pacific, investigating the effects of the Chinese stock market crash (2015â€“2016) for the first time. Employing the Bayesian VAR and BEKK GARCH, we observe that price and volatility spillover behaviours are different during the stable and stress periods. Particularly, price spillovers from China to other regional markets are more significant during a bullish period, showing that â€˜good newsâ€™ emanating from China has strong impacts on its neighbours during better market condition. In the turbulent period, we observe strong shock spillover effects and enhanced volatility spillovers from China to most Asia-Pacific stock markets. This is because China, as an important trading partner and strategic financial centre shows to exert significant influence on the Asia-Pacific region through various economic channels. We also find that the Asia-Pacific stock markets spill over their shocks to China during the crisis, indicating that China is becoming more integrated with the regional financial markets."

"Imagining the Dirty Green City Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure The green city is being elevated to the status of a self-evident good in the theory and practice of urban sustainability. A large literature documents the linked environmental, economic and well-being benefits associated with vegetating urban systems to maximise the ecosystem function. Contemporary urban greening seeks to challenge attempts to expel nature from the city in a quest for order and control. However, by imagining nature as a new mode of urban purification, much effort in the name of the green city inverts and reproduces dualistic understandings of natural and built space. In response, we disrupt the normative dialectics of purity and dirt that sustain this dualism to expose the untidy but fertile ground of the green city. We draw together Ash Aminâ€™s four registers of the Good Cityâ€“relatedness, rights, repair and re-enchantmentâ€“with the artworks of the Australian visual ecologist Aviva Reed. Our work seeks to enrich the practice of more-than-human urbanism through â€˜dirt thinkingâ€™ by imagining the transformative possibilities in, of and for the dirty green city."

"Seasonal metabolic analysis of marine sediments collected from Moreton Bay in South East Queensland, Australia, using a multi-omics-based approach Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus Anthropogenic effects of urban density have altered natural ecosystems. Such changes include eutrophication of freshwater and adjoining coastal habitats, and increased levels of inorganic nutrients and pollutants into waterways. In Australia, these changes are intensified by large-scale ocean-atmospheric events, leading to considerable abiotic stress on the natural flora and fauna. Bacterial communities in marine sediments from Moreton Bay (South East Queensland, Australia) were examined in order to assess the impact of rainfall changes, chemical pollution, and subsequent abiotic stress on living organisms within a marine ecosystem. Sediments were collected during the wet and dry seasons and analyzed using bacterial metagenomics and community metabolomics techniques. Physicochemical data were also analyzed to account for biological variance that may be due to non-rainfall-based abiotic stresses. Wet-dry seasonality was the dominant control on bacterial community structure and metabolic function. Changes in the availability of nutrients, organic matter and light appeared to be the major seasonal stressors. In contrast, urban and industrial pollutants appeared to be minor stressors at the sites sampled. During the wet season, the bacterial community composition reflected organisms that utilize biogeochemical pathways with fast kinetics, such as aerobic metabolism, direct assimilation of inorganic compounds, and primary production. The transition to the dry season saw the bacterial community composition shift towards organisms that utilize more complex organic energy sources, such as carbohydrates and fatty acids, and anaerobic redox processes."

"Technology-Facilitated Sexual Violence: A Literature Review of Empirical Research Stalking; Harassment; Crime Victims Technology-facilitated sexual violence (TFSV) refers to a range of behaviors where digital technologies are used to facilitate both virtual and face-to-face sexually based harms. Such behaviors include online sexual harassment, gender- and sexuality-based harassment, cyberstalking, image-based sexual exploitation, and the use of a carriage service to coerce a victim into an unwanted sexual act. This article reviews the current state of knowledge on these different dimensions, drawing on existing empirical studies. While there is a growing body of research into technology-facilitated harms perpetrated against children and adolescents, there is a dearth of qualitative and quantitative research on TFSV against adults. Moreover, few of the existing studies provide reliable data on the nature, scope, and impacts of TFSV. Preliminary studies, however, indicate that some harms, much like sexual violence more broadly, may be predominantly gender-, sexuality-, and age-based, with young women being overrepresented as victims in some categories. This review collects the empirical evidence to date regarding the prevalence and gender-based nature of TFSV against adults and discusses the implications for policy and programs, as well as suggestions for future research."

"Automated Disaster Monitoring From Social Media Posts Using AI-Based Location Intelligence and Sentiment Analysis Twitter; Disaster; Event Detection Worldwide disasters like bushfires, earthquakes, floods, cyclones, and heatwaves have affected the lives of social media users in an unprecedented manner. They are constantly posting their level of negativity over the disaster situations at their location of interest. Understanding location-oriented sentiments about disaster situation is of prime importance for political leaders, and strategic decision-makers. To this end, we present a new fully automated algorithm based on artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP), for extraction of location-oriented public sentiments on global disaster situation. We designed the proposed system to obtain exhaustive knowledge and insights on social media feeds related to disaster in 110 languages through AI- and NLP-based sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), anomaly detection, regression, and Getis Ord Gi* algorithms. We deployed and tested this algorithm on live Twitter feeds from 28 September to 6 October 2021. Tweets with 67 515 entities in 39 different languages were processed during this period. Our novel algorithm extracted 9727 location entities with greater than 70&#x0025; confidence from live Twitter feed and displayed the locations of possible disasters with disaster intelligence. The rates of average precision, recall, and F&#x2081;-Score were measured to be 0.93, 0.88, and 0.90, respectively. Overall, the fully automated disaster monitoring solution demonstrated 97&#x0025; accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report location intelligence with NER, sentiment analysis, regression and anomaly detection on social media messages related to disasters and has covered the largest set of languages."
"Natural compounds with potential to modulate cancer therapies and self-reactive immune cells Nivolumab; Pembrolizumab; Immunotherapy Cancer-related deaths are approaching 10 million each year. Survival statistics for some cancers, such as ovarian cancer, have remained unchanged for decades, with women diagnosed at stage III or IV having over 80% chance of a lethal cancer recurrence after standard first-line treatment (reductive surgery and chemotherapy). New treatments and adjunct therapies are needed. In ovarian cancer, as in other cancers, the immune response, particularly cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells are correlated with a decreased risk of recurrence. As well as completely new antigen targets resulting from DNA mutations (neo-antigens), these T cells recognize cancer-associated overexpressed, re-expressed or modified self-proteins. However, there is concern that activation of self-reactive responses may also promote off-target pathology. This review considers the complex interplay between cancer-reactive and self-reactive immune cells and discusses the potential uses for various leading immunomodulatory compounds, derived from plant-based sources, as a cancer therapy option or to modulate potential autoimmune pathology. Along with reviewing well-studied compounds such as curcumin (from turmeric), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, from green tea) and resveratrol (from grapes and certain berries), it is proposed that compounds from novel sources, for example, native Australian plants, will provide a useful source for the fine modulation of cancer immunity in patients."

"Relationship between Southern Bluefin Tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, melanomacrophage centres and Cardicola spp. (Trematoda: Aporocotylidae) infection Opecoelidae; Digenea (Trematoda); Animals Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT), Thunnus maccoyii, is ranched off Port Lincoln, South Australia and is Australia's second largest economic finfish aquaculture industry. The biggest threats to SBT health identified by the industry are the blood flukes Cardicola forsteri and C. orientalis (Trematoda: Aporocotylidae). Melanomacrophage centres (MMCs) are aggregations of pigmented macrophage like cells present in spleen, kidney and liver of teleost fish. The aim of this study was to quantify MMCs in SBT anterior kidney, liver and spleen to investigate changes in relation to Cardicola spp. Infection. Samples were collected at the end of ranching from pontoons where SBT were treated with PZQ and pontoons with untreated SBT. SBT MMC percentage of surface area cover was highest in SBT spleen and lowest in the liver. Significant positive correlations were identified between SBT MMC area and SBT size in all three organs (p < 0.05). MMC area and parasite infection showed significant positive correlations in the kidney and spleen for Cardicola spp. gill egg counts, and in the kidney for C. forsteri DNA from SBT hearts and gills (p < 0.05). MMCs area increased with increased intensity of Cardicola spp. Infection and MMCs have the potential to be used as an indicator to assess health effects that Cardicola spp. have on SBT."

"Dietary Alpha-Linolenic Acid Supports High Retinal DHA Levels Long Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Pregnancy The retina requires docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for optimal function. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and DHA are dietary sources of retinal DHA. This research investigated optimizing retinal DHA using dietary ALA. Previous research identified 19% DHA in retinal phospholipids was associated with optimal retinal function in guinea pigs. Pregnant guinea pigs were fed dietary ALA from 2.8% to 17.3% of diet fatty acids, at a constant level of linoleic acid (LA) of 18% for the last one third of gestation and retinal DHA levels were assessed in 3-week-old offspring maintained on the same diets as their mothers. Retinal DHA increased in a linear fashion with the maximum on the diet with LA:ALA of 1:1. Feeding diets with LA:ALA of 1:1 during pregnancy and assessing retinal DHA in 3-week-old offspring was associated with optimized retinal DHA levels. We speculate that the current intakes of ALA in human diets, especially in relation to LA intakes, are inadequate to support high DHA levels in the retina."

includes net zero emissions for the whole economy by 2050, and adaptation action plans for key systems. Primary
Production has been identified as a key system and the Minister for Agriculture is the nominated lead Minister to delivery
this plan by October 31 2021. The Act requires AAPs to be developed every five years after that.
The delivery of the AAP is being overseen by the Executive Board (EB) of the Department of Jobs Precincts and
Regions (DJPR), with the Chief Adviser, Climate Change in Industry Transition (CCIT) responsible for bringing items to
the EB for consideration. The CCIT team is leading the delivery of the AAP in close collaboration with Agriculture
Victoria, Rural and Regional Victoria (Plantation Forestry), and Fisheries Victoria. A Steering Committee has been
established to ensure delivery of the AAP on time and has representation of each agency.
The purpose of this engagement is to provide the Steering Committee with access to necessary technical expertise to
develop an evidence-based AAP for primary production. Technical expertise will be sought at a daily rate to support the
Steering Committee, and to review and advise on components of the work. Expertise will also be sought on industry
transitions to support this parallel workstream in the CCIT team.
The technical specialist will have expertise in climate change adaptation in the primary production system in Victoria as
well as industry transitions. The technical specialist will report to the Project Manager (Senior Advisor Adaptation) and
support the Steering Committee."
"Work like a girl: Redressing gender inequity in academia through systemic solutions Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science Historically, the professional structure of higher education has provided restricted employment, career, and leadership opportunities for women. This is exacerbated where there is an intersection between gender and race, culture, religion, or age. Women continue to be underrepresented in senior leadership positions across a range of disciplines, and this lack of representation of women within the professional structure of higher education itself acts as a barrier for more women reaching senior levels within institutions. More women are needed in higher positions to increase representation and visibility, and to encourage and mentor others to then aspire to follow a similar path. This critical review examines gender equity across the major career benchmarks of the academy in light of the impact of the personal contexts of women, systemic processes, and cultural barriers that hinder career progression. Research-based systemic solutions that work towards improved gender equity for women are discussed. The findings from this critical review highlight the need for global systemic change in higher education to create ethical equities in the employment, career, and leadership opportunities for women."

"Recycling Perspectives of Circular Business Models: A Review Industrial Symbiosis; Sustainable Development; Circular Economy The circular business model (CBM) is one of the main building blocks of circular economy (CE), and recycling is one of the main strategies for achieving it. CBM literature is currently evolving, and recycling-oriented discussion has been found in a scattered manner. This review article aims to identify critical components of the recycling-focused business model in CE and evaluate potential business and research opportunities in the area. Data collection was undertaken from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection and ScienceDirect database. Results of the study showed that efficiency of municipal solid waste management, reporting mechanism of recyclers cost of recycled materials, the establishment of a plastic hub, implementation of extended producer responsibility, strategic partnership, incentives, and product design were highlighted as critical requirements for efficient recycling operated business models, especially for waste solar PV panels, e-waste, textile waste, and vehicles and battery sector. It also identified the benefits of using recycled materials in reducing carbon footprint, energy consumption, and achieving low environmental impact. Three-dimensional printing, sensor-based RFID tags, digital twins, additive manufacturing, Industry 4.0, and the Internet of Things (IoT) were found as state-of-the-art technological innovations applied to recycling-oriented circular business models. This article provides critical practical solutions for new business model development and indicates vital future research directions along with a conceptual framework development, which would be helpful for policymakers, business entities, and research academics."
"Combining laboratory and computational approaches to develop reliable low cost HIV prognostics HIV entry into immune system cells involves engagement of cell-surface CCR5 or CXCR4 receptor. 'CCR5 antagonist' anti-HIV drugs, such as maraviroc (MVC), bind to CCR5 and block entry of CCR5-using (R5) HIV strains. Because CCR5 antagonists are contraindicated in patients harbouring CXCR4-using viruses, a pre-treatment laboratory prognostic test (called TrofileTM) is required to determine patient's HIV receptor usage. However, the cost, long turn-around time, and specialised nature of TrofileTM have limited patient access to CCR5 antagonists worldwide.

In response, relatively cheap, rapid in silico HIV genetic sequence-based prognostics have been developed. However, these have been developed specifically for HIV subtype B viruses, which account for 10% of infections. In this study, I will develop and clinically validate the first suite of in silico prognostics specific for each of the major HIV subtypes that account for >95% of infections worldwide. Some R5 HIV strains can acquire resistance to CCR5 antagonists by acquiring the ability to engage drug-bound CCR5. Unfortunately, the only prognostic for R5 HIV resistance to CCR5 antagonists is an expensive and time-consuming laboratory test. In this study, I will establish and perform extensive molecular studies on a large panel of longitudinal HIV clones from patients who failed MVC treatment due to emergence of resistant R5 viruses. These data will inform the development of the first in silico HIV genetic sequence-based prognostics for determining (i) R5 HIV resistance to MVC (and other CCR5 antagonists), and (ii) whether patient?s HIV is ?predisposed? to become MVC resistant thus contraindicating therapy. I expect these novel prognostics, informed by my molecular studies, will improve patient access to MVC and other CCR5 antagonists, and treatment outcome, in particular for patients residing in resource-constrained regions where non-B HIV predominate, and which are burdened most by the pandemic."

"Biodiversity sensitive urban design: from theory to practice (Stage 2) Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design (BSUD) is a protocol that aims to create urban environments that generates benefits for native biodiversity, through careful design that provides habitat and resources, mitigates threats, and plans for connectivity in the landscape.
It represents a new approach to urban biodiversity conservation by seeking to achieve biodiversity benefits on site, in contrast to the standard offsetting approach, which both reduces the opportunity for urban residents to engage with nature and delivers questionable ecological outcomes.

BSUD aims to protect native species and ecosystems in the places where people live, work and play. Urban greening associated with BSUD also provides a range of proven benefits to individuals, communities and cities, including:
- Cooling of urban areas
- Air and water purification
- Human health and wellbeing benefits"

"Technological, nutritional and sensory properties of pasta fortified with agro-industrial by-products: a review Noodles; Pasta; Flour Reducing food waste is a priority to move towards more sustainable food systems. Since agro-food by-products are often rich in healthy compounds, such as fibre, phytochemicals, protein, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals, the waste valorisation could move through their transformation into ingredients useful for the formulation of functional foods. Pasta is a staple food widely consumed all over the world representing an optimal carrier for nutrients delivery. The incorporation of ingredients of a high added value obtained by agro-industrial by-products in pasta can improve its nutritional value and provides several health benefits. At the same time, the inclusion of new ingredients could modify the physical, chemical and textural properties determining the change of the organoleptic characteristics of fortified pasta, affecting its acceptability. Thus, the preparation of new pasta formulations with high nutritional properties, good technological and sensory characteristics represents a challenge for the food industry."

"Recycling waste rubber tyres in construction materials and associated environmental considerations: A review Rubber Waste; Mechanical Properties; Tires Waste tyres and their accumulation is a global environmental concern; they are not biodegradable, and, globally, an estimated 1.5 billion are generated annually. Waste tyres in landfill and stockpiles are renowned for leaching toxic chemicals into the surrounding environment, acting as breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and fuelling inextinguishable fires. The properties of waste tyre rubber and engineering applications have been previously reported in a range of publications with respect to the environmental, economic, and technical factors. This study compiles and reviews this research with a focus on geotechnical engineering applications, such as earthworks and infrastructure construction. The applications of waste rubber in construction materials includes cementitious concrete, asphalt concrete, and granular materials for earth structures. Crumb rubber, when used as a sand replacement in flowable concrete fill, improved ductility and strength-to-weight ratio. A 40 MPa concrete mix with 0.6% rubber crumb content exhibited optimal strength and air entrainment capabilities, displaying minimal damage after 56 freeze/thaw cycles. Rubber, as a partial replacement for aggregate in road base and sub-base layers, adversely affected the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of the graded aggregate base course. Rubber-soil mixtures as the interface of foundation and structure yielded a 60â€“70 % reduction in vertical and horizontal ground accelerations when subjected to earthquake simulation modelling. There is concern regarding the toxicity of waste rubber incorporated products due to leachates of heavy metals and other chemicals common in tyres. Further comprehensive studies in this area are needed. Leachate studies should be conducted under different pH and liquid to solid ratios."

"Disruption and the matching market for new multifamily housing in Melbourne, Australia School Choice; Stable Matching; Strategy-Proofness A key area of system impact of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) is the radical improvement in the functioning of matching markets. Matching markets are markets in which agents seek to be paired with someone or something with the criteria for matching often highly specific. Traditionally, the cost and difficulty in matching means many of these markets have not functioned well. Uber and Airbnb are examples of new matching market matchmakers that have been â€˜turbo-chargedâ€™ by new digital technologies, resulting in what Parker et al. describe as a â€˜platform revolutionâ€™. In this article, we examine the traditional, but poorly functioning, matching market for new multifamily housing development in Melbourne, Australia, and the potential for disruption offered by a new platform, Nightingale Housing Ltd. (NHL). Improved matching has been critical to the model and the Internet has been central to this. The NHL model has the potential for systems impact as outlined by Schwab in his conception of 4IR."

"Trends in wheat yields under representative climate futures: Implications for climate adaptation Crops; Break Crops; Farming Systems Underestimating the impacts of climate change on agricultural production could lead to complacency about the potential adaptation challenges. This study used a Representative Climate Futures (RCF) approach to model projected wheat yields under climate change in Australia. It simulated the range of impacts, resulting from a subset of individual Global Climate Models (GCMs), on wheat production in the major wheat regions of Australia. The study used RCFs that represented â€˜most-likelyâ€™ â€˜bestâ€™ and â€˜worstâ€™ cases across multiple Representative Concentration pathways (RCPs). Median wheat yields modelled for the South West Australia projected declines between 26% and 38%, under a â€˜most-likelyâ€™ case for RCP 4.5 by 2090, and between 41% and 49%, under a â€˜most-likelyâ€™ case for RCP 8.5. Median wheat yields declined under RCP 8.5 for the â€˜most-likelyâ€™ case across the majority of wheat producing regions, with a range of 1% to 49%. Greater declines were projected under the â€˜worstâ€™ cases of hottest and driest climates. However, the â€˜bestâ€™ cases of least warm and wetter climates projected an increase in median wheat yield, a range of 2% to 87%. Variability also changed from the baseline under all projected RCFs and across all regions, with a standard deviation of up to 2.46 t/ha under the â€˜most likelyâ€™ case at a site in south-eastern Australia. These likely shifts in the size and reliability of yields, combined with concurrent climate change impacts on other factors, mean that agriculture faces significant adaptation challenges, particularly under some of the â€˜most-likelyâ€™ scenarios and all of the â€˜worstâ€™ case scenarios. Further work is required to explore how scenarios in one region relate to those in other regions and thus the overall outcome at the continental scale."

"Naturopathy in Australia: Where are we now? Where are we heading? Complementary and Alternative Medicine; Alternative Medicine; Mind-Body Therapies Naturopathy is the general practice of natural therapies. It emphasizes prevention, treatment, and promotion of optimal health through therapeutic modalities which encourage the self-healing process of the body. Formalized in the 19th century by the hydrotherapy and nature cure movement in Austria and Germany, naturopathy was introduced to Australia at the turn of the 20th century. It became popular since the 1970s due to social and cultural change characterized by the post-modern philosophy, as well as government policies highlighting individual responsibility and freedom of choice. Naturopathy is one of the most popular forms of complementary medicine in Australia today with naturopaths received 4.9 million consultations annually. Naturopathic consultations are sought for a variety of conditions and, in some areas, as a form of primary care, especially by middle-aged women who have a higher education level and a higher annual income. The number of Australian naturopaths was estimated to be over 4000 in 2017 and expects to grow to over 4600 by 2022, although this number is likely to be an underestimation. Australian naturopaths, as a predominantly female profession, work mainly in private clinical practice with nutritional medicine, herbal medicine, homeopathy, as well as massage therapies being the most common modalities used. There are also signs of greater integration with community pharmacies and integrative medicine clinics in major cities. The Bachelor's degree programs in Naturopathy has just become the only accredited entry-level qualification since late 2015. Currently, there are only 5 private colleges offering naturopathic education, a far cry from the 40 over in mid-2000. The profession continues to be self-regulated. There is no barrier of entry to practice and unqualified practitioners of naturopathy can potentially do harm to the public. The registration of naturopaths remains unresolved due to fragmented representation under many professional associations, disunity among the profession, and objections by certain health care lobbyists. There is a dearth of research demonstrating efficacy of the whole practice of naturopathy in Australia, which has directed the government's decision to withdraw it from private health insurance coverage from 2019. Moving forward, the whole system research of naturopathy in Australia will be in focus with the recent establishment of a practice-based research network and an international research consortium. With increasing scrutiny from evidence-based medicine, the present and future challenge to Australian naturopaths is centered on the integration of both scientific and traditional evidence to form the foundation of a person-centered, evidence-informed practice."

"Carbon risk and firm performance: Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment Sustainability; Environmental Management Systems; Eco-Management and Audit Scheme This article examines the effect of carbon risk on firm performance, exploiting the Australia ratification of Kyoto Protocol in December 2007 as an exogenous shock. The article finds that polluters, firms in highest-emitting industries, experience a reduction in financial performance relative to controlling non-polluters subsequent to the ratification, and the effect is more pronounced among financially constrained firms. The results are robust to various definitions of polluters, measures of financial constraints, falsification tests on the timing of the Kyoto adoption and the impact of the Global Financial Crisis. The evidence suggests a negative association between carbon risk and firm performance."

"The Australian energy transition as a federalism challenge: (Un)cooperative energy federalism? Renewable Portfolio Standard; Solar Energy Conversion; Green Certificates The law and regulation of the energy sector in Australia is subject to overlapping responsibilities of both federal and state governments. Crucially for energy transition efforts, neither energy, environment nor climate is mentioned in the Australian Constitution. Australia has a tradition of creative cooperative federalism solutions for responding to problems of national importance. In the energy sector this has resulted in an intricate national framework for energy markets, which relies on mirror legislation passed by participating states, with oversight by state and federal executive governments. Independently of these frameworks, both federal and state governments have passed climate change legislation, which crucially includes renewable energy support mechanisms. At a time when a rapid transition to a decarbonized energy system is essential, legal frameworks struggle to respond in a timely fashion. The political discourse around energy has become increasingly toxic â€“ reflecting a dysfunctional stateâ€“federal relationship in energy and climate law. Australia needs to consider whether its cooperative federalism solutions are sufficient to support the energy transition and how climate law at the state and federal levels interacts with energy market legal frameworks."

"Experimental investigation, techno-economic analysis and environmental impact of bioethanol production from banana stem Transesterification; Catalyst; Rubber Seed Oil Banana stem is being considered as the second largest waste biomass in Malaysia. Therefore, the environmental challenge of managing this huge amount of biomass as well as converting the feedstock into value-added products has spurred the demand for diversified applications to be implemented as a realistic approach. In this study, banana stem waste was experimented for bioethanol generation via hydrolysis and fermentation methods with the presence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) subsequently. Along with the experimental analysis, a realistic pilot scale application of electricity generation from the bioethanol has been designed by HOMER software to demonstrate techno-economic and environmental impact. During sulfuric acid and enzymatic hydrolysis, the highest glucose yield was 5.614 and 40.61 g/L, respectively. During fermentation, the maximum and minimum glucose yield was 62.23 g/L at 12 h and 0.69 g/L at 72 h, respectively. Subsequently, 99.8% pure bioethanol was recovered by a distillation process. Plant modeling simulated operating costs 65,980 US$/y, net production cost 869347 US$ and electricity cost 0.392 US$/kWh. The CO2 emission from bioethanol was 97,161 kg/y and SO2 emission was 513 kg/y which is much lower than diesel emission. The overall bioethanol production from banana stem and application of electricity generation presented the approach economically favorable and environmentally benign."

"City of Parramatta Urban Tree Canopy Study, 2020/21 The development and selection of methodologies to interface with planning systems represents an ongoing research challenge. To achieve the objectives above, especially point 3 above, the team will employ and adapt existing methodologies (i-Tree, Geographically Weighted Regression) for identifying areas that can be planted. The outcome will enable the City of Parramatta to better target its planting efforts to reach its projected 40% canopy target by 2050.

This study of tree canopy directly draws and builds upon the team's (Amati/Hurley/Sun/Deilami) ongoing research expertise in the field of urban planning, specifically through the relationship between planning context and capacity and the potential for increasing canopy cover and urban green spaces. The findings from this study will contribute to the team's research publications."

"Political connections and post-disaster assistance in rural Vietnam Vietnam; Wildcat Strike; Urbanization Political connections have been shown to lead to corruption, favouritism and the pursuit of self-interests. They can therefore serve as an impediment to development and poverty reduction. This study examines whether having political connections is associated with post-disaster support from government authorities in the case of Vietnam. Using commune level data for the period 2012 to 2014 and a number of alternative econometric specifications, it finds that communes with higher levels of connections at the district level have a higher probability of receiving support in a post-shock period. The type of political connections is found to be important. We find a strong impact of political connections when household members are officials themselves or when households have relatives as officials. Having friends as officials does not appear to impact the likelihood of receiving assistance. The impacts are also greater when households have siblings, offspring or cousins working in government, but no evidence is found when officials are parents. Finally, having connections with district leaders is more important than connections with district officials."

"Ethnic diversity, energy poverty and the mediating role of trust: Evidence from household panel data for Australia1 Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Energy poverty is now a major concern on the public policy agenda in many countries. However, evidence on the determinants of energy poverty is relatively scant. Our study contributes to the debate on the determinants of energy poverty by being the first to examine the impact of ethnic diversity on household energy poverty. Using 12 waves of longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, we find that, in Australia, ethnic diversity is positively associated with energy poverty. Our preferred instrumented estimates suggest that a standard deviation increase in ethnic diversity is associated with a 0.103â€“0.422 standard deviation increase in energy poverty, depending on how energy poverty is measured. This finding is generally robust to alternative ways of measuring ethnic diversity and energy poverty. We identify trust as an important channel through which ethnic diversity operates and point to the need for policies that engender social capital in multicultural societies as a means to harness the benefits of diversity."

"Two institutional responses to work-integrated learning in a time of COVID-19: Canada and Australia Placement; Cooperative Education; Employability As the world reacts to the impact of COVID-19, work-integrated learning (WIL) programs globally are similarly affected. Across Canada and Australia, thousands of WIL students either shifted to working remotely or dismissed from their WIL experience. This disruption impacted student learning, program delivery, risk management, staff capability, and industry engagement, and posed significant challenges for institutions. This paper presents the responses to COVID-19 by the University of Waterloo, Canada, and RMIT University, Australia, each guided by quality WIL principles and different WIL organizational structures. This paper outlines how each institution: mobilized staff, introduced program changes while maintaining quality, engaged industry partners and presented WIL program-based solutions to COVID-19 challenges. The paper concludes with discussion on challenges and opportunities that events such as COVID-19 has upon WIL programs, implications for other institutions and student outcomes. Consideration is given to post-COVID scenarios, and how WIL might need to be re-imagined."

"Vocational education and the revitalisation of manufacturing in the United States Apprenticeship Training; Firm; Human Capital Theory Manufacturing in advanced open economies has experienced significant disruption. Rapid technological change, outsourcing and off shoring have beset manufacturing resulting in a general and steady decline in manufacturing employment. Despite this turbulence, there remains a strong nostalgia for manufacturing resulting in frequent public policy discussion about how best to revitalise the industry. A popular view is that a strong manufacturing industry relies upon an equally strong vocational, education and training (VET) system to provide requisite skill needs. Given the dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing industry do such arguments still hold true? This paper considers this question through an examination of what the revitalisation of US manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and the extent to which USâ€™s decentralised and largely eroded VET system serves as a barrier to the industryâ€™s revitalisation. Drawing upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and secondary data collected in three US cities, the paper argues that the focus on needing to have a strong VET system overlooks the emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems that evolve to address local skill needs. These micro skill eco-systems open the prospects for skills and training innovations to meet changing workforce needs in a changing industry."

"Regional variation in forest canopy height and implications for koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) habitat mapping and forest management Lidar; Tree Crown; Canopy Height Previous research has shown that the Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) prefers larger trees, potentially making this a key factor influencing koala habitat quality. Generally, tree height is considered at regional scales which may overlook variation at patch or local scales. In this study, we aimed to derive a set of parameters to assist in classifying koala habitat in terms of tree height, which can then be used as an overlay for existing habitat maps. To determine canopy height variation within a specific forest community across a broad area in eastern Australia, we used freely available Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data and adopted a straightforward approach by extracting maximum-height ALS returns within a total of 288 30 m Ã— 30 m â€œvirtualâ€ ALS plots. Our findings show that while maximum tree heights generally fall within published regional-scale parameters (mean height 33.2 m), they vary significantly between subregions (mean height 28.8â€“39.0 m), within subregions (e.g., mean height 21.3â€“29.4 m), and at local scales, the tree heights vary in response to previous land-use (mean height 28.0â€“34.2 m). A canopy height dataset useful for habitat management needs to recognise and incorporate these variations. To examine how this information might be synthesised into a usable map, we used a wall-to-wall canopy height map derived from ALS to investigate spatial and nonspatial clustering techniques that capture canopy height variability at both intra-subregional (100s of hectares) and local (60 hectare) scales. We found that nonspatial K-medians clustering with three or four height classes is suited to intra-subregional extents because it allows for simultaneous assessment and comparison of multiple forest community polygons. Spatially constrained clustering algorithms are suited to individual polygons, and we recommend the use of the Redcap algorithm because it delineates contiguous height classes recognisable on a map. For habitat management, an overlay combining these height classification approaches as separate attributes would provide the greatest utility at a range of scales. In addition to koala habitat management, canopy height maps could also assist in managing other fauna; identifying forest disturbance, regenerating forest, and old-growth forest; and identifying errors in existing forest maps."

"Enhanced Transient Performance of a Self-Synchronising Inverter during Start up and Severe Grid Fault Conditions Inverters; Electric Current Control; Connected This paper explores the process of transient inrush current associated with inverters during grid connection startup and grid fault events. The analysis presented identifies the equivalence between both scenarios and investigates the influence of the filter impedance and current controller bandwidth on these current transients. A novel strategy is then proposed to minimise the impact of such transient events, which achieves both a seamless start up, and is capable of riding through a solid short circuit (i.e. zero voltage or crowbar) grid fault. The strategy has been verified via detailed switched simulation and experimental investigations."
"A comprehensive review of biodegradable synthetic polymer-ceramic composites and their manufacture for biomedical applications Tissue Engineering; Scaffold; Selective Laser Sintering The application of various materials in biomedical procedures has recently experienced rapid growth. One area that is currently receiving significant attention from the scientific community is the treatment of a number of different types of bone-related diseases and disorders by using biodegradable polymer-ceramic composites. Biomaterials, the most common materials used to repair or replace damaged parts of the human body, can be categorized into three major groups: metals, ceramics, and polymers. Composites can be manufactured by combining two or more materials to achieve enhanced biocompatibility and biomechanical properties for specific applications. Biomaterials must display suitable properties for their applications, about strength, durability, and biological influence. Metals and their alloys such as titanium, stainless steel, and cobalt-based alloys have been widely investigated for implant-device applications because of their excellent mechanical properties. However, these materials may also manifest biological issues such as toxicity, poor tissue adhesion and stress shielding effect due to their high elastic modulus. To mitigate these issues, hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings have been used on metals because their chemical composition is similar to that of bone and teeth. Recently, a wide range of synthetic polymers such as poly (L-lactic acid) and poly (L-lactide-co-glycolide) have been studied for different biomedical applications, owing to their promising biocompatibility and biodegradability. This article gives an overview of synthetic polymer-ceramic composites with a particular emphasis on calcium phosphate group and their potential applications in tissue engineering. It is hoped that synthetic polymer-ceramic composites such as PLLA/HA and PCL/HA will provide advantages such as eliminating the stress shielding effect and the consequent need for revision surgery."

"Foreign aid and energy poverty: Sub-national evidence from Senegal Aid; Official Development Assistance; International Cooperation We contribute to the literature on foreign aid effectiveness and energy poverty by examining the effect of foreign aid on energy poverty. Using five rounds of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and sub-national aid data for Senegal, we find that aid lowers the probability of energy poverty. Our main results show that living within a 25-km radius of an aid project reduces the likelihood of being energy poor by 3.3 percentage points. This finding is robust to a suite of sensitivity checks. We also examine four channels through which aid could influence energy poverty â€“ income poverty, education, health and economic growth â€“ and find that income poverty, education and economic growth are mechanisms through which aid transmits to energy poverty."

"LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON THE CONSERVATION ISSUE OF PULAU KUKUP NATIONAL PARK IN JOHOR, MALAYSIA Cultural Ecosystem Services; China; Natural Capital The Ramsar Convention came into force on 21 December 1975, and Malaysia ratified the convention in 1994. As a party to the convention, Malaysia has shown its commitment by promoting seven Ramsar sites. Although the Ramsar sites have experienced human intervention and degradation over time, legislation in Malaysia has helped to promote the sustainable development of wetlands in Malaysia. In this paper, a critical analysis of the role of law in protecting and conserving Pulau Kukup Johor National Park as one of the Ramsar sites in Malaysia was conducted based on documents and newspaperreports analysis. In addition, the prohibition of environmental impact assessment (EIA) to be conducted on any Ramsar site in Malaysia is also discussed. Results reveal the importance of legislation to conserve and protect wetlands in Malaysia."

"Productivity benefits of employer-sponsored training: A study of the Australia transport and logistics industry Apprenticeship Training; Firm; Human Capital Theory Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of employer-sponsored workforce training on employee productivity in the Australian transport and logistics industry. It challenges the quantitative notion of the ratio of inputâ€“output per labour hour as the single most important measure of productivity. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilised a mixed-method approach, involving online and on-site survey questionnaires and on-site semi-structured interviews of employers, employees and students within the industry. Survey questionnaires were administered to Vocational Education and Training (VET) learners to determine the dimensions of productivity gains, while qualitative interviews were conducted specifically to capture employersâ€™ perceptions and expectations of the benefits of training. Findings: Results show that the relationship between employer-sponsored training and workforce productivity is multi-dimensional where, ideally, all essential dimensions must be fulfilled to effectively achieve sustainable productivity level. One dimension is the quantitative measure of increased performance as an outcome of enhanced knowledge, skills and competencies. Another relates to the increased self-confidence, job satisfaction and pride. The third dimension is the cost savings that come with increasing employeesâ€™ overall awareness and appreciation of occupational health and safety. The results show that, aside from the dominant theories on training and labour productivity, the perception of the benefits of training on workplace productivity is not merely limited to the conventional understanding of productivity as a simplistic relationship between resource inputs and tangible outputs. Practical implications: Firms should consider redefining the benefits of training to include employee well-being and individual contribution to common team and organisational goals. Organisations therefore should broaden the notion of productivity to incorporate intangible benefits. Originality/value: The use of multi-method approach to investigate the views and perceptions of employees, employers and trainers about the productivity benefits of training and key concerns and challenges for the industry."
"Reducing the health and economic burden of Campylobacter using a live vaccine The aim of this project is to develop a vaccine to reduce Campylobacter bacteria in chickens. Campylobacters cause disease in both poultry & humans & poultry products are the most common source of human infections. By reducing Campylobacter in poultry, we expect to reduce the transfer to humans. The expected outcomes arising from this work will be a reduction of the economic burden of poultry losses, in an Australian industry valued at $2.8 billion/year, & also a reduction in the cost of human foodborne illness, estimated to be $1.2 billion dollars/year. This project is, therefore, poised to benefit the Australian economy including primary producers, retailers and the general public through targeted vaccination in the poultry industry. "

"Child labor and psychosocial wellbeing: Findings from India Child Labor; Physical Abuse; Workers Mental health is a neglected health issue in developing countries. We test if mental health issues are particularly likely to occur among some of the most vulnerable children in developing countries: those that work. Despite falling in recent decades, child labor still engages 168 million children across the world. While the negative impacts of child labor on physical health are well documented, the effect of child labor on a child's psychosocial wellbeing has been neglected. We investigate this issue with a new dataset of 947 children aged 12â€“18 years from 750 households in 20 villages across five districts of Tamil Nadu, India. Our purpose-built survey allows for a holistic approach to the analysis of child wellbeing by accounting for levels of happiness, hope, emotional wellbeing, self-efficacy, fear and stress. We use a variety of econometric approaches, some of which utilize household-level fixed effects and account for differences between working and nonworking siblings. We document a robust, large and negative association between child labor and most measures of psychosocial wellbeing. The results are robust to a battery of exercises, including tests for selection on unobservables, randomization inference, instrumental variable techniques, and falsification exercises."

"Organizational strategy and corporate social responsibility: The mediating effect of triple bottom line Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Limited research in the area of the triple bottom line (TBL) mediation effect on the relationship between organizational strategic performance (OSP) and corporate social responsibility performance (CSRP) has motivated this study. The objective of this study is to investigate how OSP affects CSRP and the mediation impact of TBL elements through the decision-making process of business management. Considering a sample of 250 employees from Bangladesh, this study used structural equation modelling (SEM) to test the relevant research hypotheses. Through the lens of stakeholder, institutional, legitimacy and resource-based view theories along with rigorous statistical techniques, this study has found that OSP is positively related to CSRP. In terms of the mediation effect, this study has found that economic responsibility has no intervening role while environmental and social responsibility significantly mediated the relationship between OSP and CSRP. Finally, the full mediation power of the model suggests that OSP affects a firmâ€™s strategic decision and CSR outcomes directly as well as indirectly through TBL."
"A review on the methods used to reduce the scouring effect of bridge pier Diarrhea; Scouring; Abutments (Bridge) Bridge pier are the most widely used hydraulics structures in ocean, offshore and river engineering. As a result, scour around bridge pier, flow prediction and it interaction are widely attracted by the civil, mechanical and marine engineers. The local scour around the piers of the bridge is one of the main causes of the bridge failure. The local scour of river water is a catastrophic effect on the engineering structures. It leaves them under dangerous, maintenance prone conditions and occasionally leads to loss of life. The damage to the hydraulic and civil structure due to local scour is a global problem and has been studied experimentally and numerically by many researchers for several decades. In this paper, local scour around bridge piers as a complex phenomenon has been explained and the problem to countermeasure the local scour effect. In past two decade computer simulations have been developed for bridge pier scouring. They have an advantage of being able to simulate a situation at full scale scenario, and can easily alter the geometry as required. Early CFD simulations were mainly focused on single-phase model which require empirical sediment transport equations to predict sand motion. Multiphase CFD simulation models are a most recent development; they model sediment transport as a granular flow to predict the sand movement and analyse the scour depth. The experimental validation will be undertaken using generic water tunnel. A series of scale models will be developed in the future as per the geometric characteristic of CFD models."

"Resetting the Compass: Principles for Responsible Urban Built Environment Education (PRUE) Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Several international frameworks supporting sustainable development have come into existence since the Rio Conference in 1992. While recent frameworks developed have included education as a key component of sustainability, these frameworks do not offer a clear direction for university educators to embrace sustainability in their curriculum, and wider engagement with co academic and non academic colleagues, student, campus and wider community to work collaboratively. The principal aim of the paper is to develop and support a collaborative networked platform for university educators, particularly in the Asia Pacific to support and enhance their capacities to develop and promote sustainability education. Despite a number of international treaties to support and accelerate global trends towards sustainable development, we are still a long way from living in a low carbon world. Secondary literature review is undertaken to understand the gaps in current treaties to support a way forward to move towards sustainable futures from an educational perspective. The literature demonstrates there are gaps between intent and action. However, there is a long road to be traversed to translate ideas into reality and even more to mainstream industry knowledge, curricula and capacities to support sustainability outcomes in the built environment. There is still a gap between action and intent with regard to achieving sustainability outcomes in the built environment. These gaps are in real danger of becoming even more wider and deeper, and more urgent and critical as we fail to meet our international targets with regard to low carbon futures. PRME: Principles for Responsible Management Education translated to the built environment as PRUE: Principles for Responsible Urban built environment Education offers an opportunity for supporting sustainability into built environment programs in universities."

"Simulation scenario analysis of operational day to day storage system of biomass supply chain for a power plant case study based on logistic cost and transportation emissions Biomass; Supply Chain Design; Biomass Power Developing a sustainable transportation network of supplying and delivering a large amount of feedstock to biomass power plants depends on reducing the logistic cost and stable storage system. This study developed a simulation model to assess and help to understand the effect of the storage systems on the total logistic costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in empty fruit bunches (EFB) biomass supply chain (BSC). Our developed model is tested on a power plant industry in the Perak state of Malaysia. To analyze the sensitivity of the storage systems on the total costs and GHG emissions, two storage approaches are selected and compared: on land and satellite storage (SS) systems. This work just focused on operational day to day inventory planning. The results from our real case study showed that SS would outperform on land storage by reducing the GHG emissions from transportation near 50%. However, SS results in a triple increase in total BSC cost. Another finding is that the dedication of truck and train transportation modes is the best cost-effective alternative for transferring the EFB to the ports for the export market. But using the train instead of the barge for short distances would decrease the GHG emissions. Result of this work could be generalized for other BSCs to design a cost-effective and low-pollution transportation network design."

"Policy, plans and pathways: The 'crisis' transition to post-parental care for people ageing with intellectual disabilities in rural Australian carescapes Autism; Children with Developmental Disabilities; Caregivers The concurrent ageing of parental care-givers and people with intellectual disabilities is driving academic and social welfare concern for a post-parental care 'crisis'. The 'crisis' typically pertains to a transition from primary care in the family home precipitated by the death or incapacity of older parents without a pre-planned pathway to post-parental care. This crisis is amplified in rural communities given low service engagement with families and a deficit of disability-supported accommodation and services. Academics, service providers and policy makers have responded through a problematisation of post-parental care planning. This focus continues to normalise informal care, burdens families with responsibility for planning, and diverts attention from structural deficits in the socio-political carescape. This paper attends to the Australian policy landscape in which long-term care-giving for families living with intellectual disability is enmeshed. It contends that the dyadic and didactic model of informal long-term care has profound implications for social service support and post-parental care planning. Problematisation of carers' 'need' to relinquish primary care and for people with intellectual disabilities to transition to independent and supported living is necessary to unsettle the dominant policy and service discourse around the provision of services to sustain informal care-giving. Innovation is then needed to forge pathways of support for families in rural communities planning on continuing, transitioning and transforming care arrangements across the lifespan."
"The COVID-19, power generation and economy – Case study of a developing country Consumption Growth; Renewable Energy Consumption; Economic Growth The global COVID-19 pandemic created profound impact on every nation's economy, education, healthcare, social and cultural life, domestic and international mobility at an unprecedented level. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, most nations are undergoing through frequent full or partial lockdowns, resulting in significant economic losses, and unprecedented suffering of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Given the crucial role of electric power in economic activities, the purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on power sector and economy in a developing/emerging country as a case study. The study examined electric power generation and consumption, GDP growth, export, import, remittances, and various government measures undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was used to investigate correlation between COVID-19 cases and power consumption during full and partial lockdowns. The research revealed a long-run negative relationship between COVID-19 cases and power consumption during partial lockdowns. The study also revealed that the targeted and partial lockdowns accompanied by nation-wide mass vaccination programme can steer the economy along the power sector with minimal or no impact during the COVID-19 pandemic."

"Closing the loop: Redesigning sustainable reverse logistics network in uncertain supply chains Closed-Loop Supply Chain; Remanufacturing; Reverse Logistics This paper develops a robust stochastic optimization model for reverse logistics in closed-loop supply chains. By determining the optimal flow of products using a Chance Constrained Robust Stochastic Programming (CCRSP), it is highlighted how the number of plant openings is influenced by the changes in carbon credit price. To assess the model performance, a set of numerical experiments in different sizes are developed and conducted. The effectiveness of the results are then compared to a proposed Heuristic Hybrid Taguchi PSO (HTPSO) solution algorithm, which underlines the effectiveness of the model. A sensitivity analysis on the carbon emission rate is carried out which underlines the role of Carbon Tax Policy. Finally, a real-life case study within the automotive manufacturing industry is carried out by applying the developed robust stochastic model. From a practical standpoint, the model can potentially be employed to meet the carbon credits that are used for handling the different carbon prices and trade scenarios. Also, it provides insights on how to better manage uncertainties, as well as to reduce the overall emissions in supply chains."

"Study of a novel rotational speed amplified dual turbine wheel wave energy converter Wave Energy; Hydrodynamics; Heaving In this study, a novel wave energy converter is proposed, which features a dual turbine wheel to provide an amplified rotational speed to the generator. The design novelty of the system is that the counter-rotational turbine wheels are connected to the generator stator and rotor respectively through a belt-drive transmission system for amplification of the rotational speed of the generator. This arrangement enables the power take-off system to be placed inside the buoy which is above the waterline. Furthermore, the belt-drive transmission system can effectively absorb the load fluctuations or vibrations caused by sea waves. A lumped parameter analytical model of the system has been developed where the Lagrange principle is applied to analyze the motion of the system and the computational fluid dynamics simulation is employed to determine the drag coefficients of the system. The results obtained from the lumped parameter analytical model have been verified by experimental test results. The developed lumped parameter analytical model allows accurate performance prediction without the high computational cost of the detailed simulations. The proposed research method could be applied as an effective tool to explore the science of wave energy conversion and to optimize the power absorption capacity and the efficiency of the power take-off system, which is the originality of this paper and contributes to the new knowledge in this area. For this prototype of the dual turbine wheel wave energy converter with an overall underwater volume of 0.002 m3, the maximum harvested efficiency and harvested power at the wave excitation condition of 80 mm in amplitude and 0.3 Hz in frequency are 11.57%, and 26.4mW, respectively."

"Influence of gas injection on viscous and viscoelastic properties of Xanthan gum Sewage; Total Solids; Activated Sludge Xanthan gum is widely used as a model fluid for sludge to mimic the rheological behaviour under various conditions including impact of gas injection in sludge. However, there is no study to show the influence of gas injection on rheological properties of xanthan gum specifically at the concentrations at which it is used as a model fluid for sludge with solids concentration above 2%. In this paper, the rheological properties of aqueous xanthan gum solutions at different concentrations were measured over a range of gas injection flow rates. The effect of gas injection on both the flow and viscoelastic behaviour of Xanthan gum (using two different methods - a creep test and a time sweep test) was evaluated. The viscosity curve of different solid concentrations of digested sludge and waste activated sludge were compared with different solid concentrations of Xanthan gum and the results showed that Xanthan gum can mimic the flow behaviour of sludge in flow regime. The results in linear viscoelastic regime showed that increasing gas flow rate increases storage modulus (Gâ€™), indicating an increase in the intermolecular associations within the material structure leading to an increase in material strength and solid behaviour. Similarly, in creep test an increase in the gas flow rate decreased strain%, signifying that the material has become more resistant to flow. Both observed behaviour is opposite to what occurs in sludge under similar conditions. The results of both the creep test and the time sweep test indicated that choosing Xanthan gum aqueous solution as a transparent model fluid for sludge in viscoelastic regime under similar conditions involving gas injection in a concentration range studied is not feasible. However Xanthan gum can be used as a model material for sludge in flow regime; because it shows a similar behaviour to sludge."

"A Comprehensive Study on the Expansion of Electric Vehicles in Europe Automobile; Alternative Fuel Vehicles; Electric Car There has been a rapid increase in government efforts to expand electric vehicle markets by deploying fast-charging stations, promoting uptake through greater investment, and by enacting supportive policies. Government support and private investment have contributed to the expansion of electric vehicles in many countries. The aim of this study is to highlight and analyze the most critical aspects of the expansion of the electric vehicle market, regarding technologies, characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, opportunities, and barriers in Europe. Our study analyzes the progress of electric vehicles by reviewing recent literature based on technology, policy, and government measurements. This study provides comprehensive information on electric vehicles and perspectives that are critical to policymakers, car manufacturers, consumers, and the community. To achieve favorable results, governments should invest in developing electric vehicles and battery technologies, provide subsidies, and develop charging infrastructure. Furthermore, by analyzing current EV sales in ten countries around the world, we assess the operating costs of electric vehicles. Overall EV cost of ownership is influenced by grid electricity price, cost of financing, location, carbon tax, wind speed, and solar insolation."
"Processes and institutions for scientific independence: Reflections on land & water Australia Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Independent and impartial scientific research provides critical contributions to many contemporary policy debates, including those about climate adaptation and natural resources. Therefore, institutional arrangements that enable and protect scientific independence are central to resolving environ mental problems in advanced liberal democracies. This paper provides an overview of the research and development (R&D) funding organisation Land & Water Australia (LWA) that, due to its statutory independence, was effective and influential in promoting sustainable natural resource management. Established by legislation that provided structural independence, LWA was insulated from direct interference, enabling it to operate at armâ€™s length from executive government. The paper profiles LWA contributions to changing policies and practices, and explores the features that enabled LWA to co ordinate, organise and fund R&D, until its abolition in 2009. LWA provided a useful precedent of a statutory authority, chartered with a clear legislated purpose and legal mechanisms for ensuring independence. The paper highlights institutional arrangements that protect scientific independence, arguing that LWA provided an important model of public R&D investment directed to sustainability transformations."
"Robustness of Multiple Imputation Methods for Missing Risk Factor Data from Electronic Medical Records for Observational Studies Multiple Imputation; Missing Completely at Random; Imputation Evaluating appropriate methodologies for imputation of missing outcome data from electronic medical records (EMRs) is crucial but lacking for observational studies. Using US EMR in people with type 2 diabetes treated over 12 and 24 months with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i, n = 38,483) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA, n = 8,977), predictors of missingness of disease biomarker (HbA1c) were explored. Robustness of multiple imputation (MI) by chained equations, two-fold MI (MI-2F) and MI with Monte Carlo Markov Chain were compared to complete case analyses for drawing inferences. Compared to younger people (age quartile Q1), those in age quartile Q3 and Q4 were less likely to have missing HbA1c by 25â€“32% (range of OR CI: 0.55â€“0.88) at 6-month follow-up and by 26â€“39% (range of OR CI: 0.50â€“0.80) at 12-month follow-up. People with HbA1c â‰¥ 7.5% at baseline were 12% (OR CI: 0.83, 0.93) and 14% (OR CI: 0.77, 0.97) less likely to have missing data at 6-month follow-up in the DPP-4i and GLP-1RA groups, respectively. All imputation methods provided similar HbA1c distributions during follow-up as observed with complete case analyses. The clinical inferences based on absolute change in HbA1c and by proportion of people reducing HbA1c to a clinically acceptable level (â‰¤ 7%) were also similar between imputed data and complete case analyses. MI-2F method provided marginally smaller mean difference between observed and imputed data with relatively smaller standard error of difference, compared to other methods, while evaluating for consistency through artificial within-sample analyses. The established MI techniques can be reliably employed for missing outcome data imputations in large EMR-based relational databases, leading to efficiently designing and drawing robust clinical inferences in pharmaco-epidemiological studies."
"Influenced or to be influenced: Engaging social media influencers in nation branding through the lens of authenticity Destination; Public Diplomacy; Brand Identity Social media influencers are emerging as a new force in shaping public discourse and raising public awareness of socio-political agendas in the digital space. This paper explores the role of influencers as part of the citizens group in nation branding by looking into their interactions with followers through the lens of authenticity. It analyzes the networked narratives generated by the influencers and followers, using the mixed methods of blending content analysis with social network analysis. The findings identify the potential of influencers evolving as a crucial force in contributing to a representative national brand informed through imbuing authenticity with engagement, featuring valued-based content, interactivity, creativity and intrinsic motivations within an ethical communication mechanism. It advances influencer studies in nation branding by underpinning the two-way construct of authenticity in generating influence; and informs the development of strategies for engaging citizens in nation branding through influencers using authenticity.

"Iron phosphide encapsulated in P-doped graphitic carbon as efficient and stable electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions Catalyst; Cobalt Phosphide; Water Splitting The development of durable and efficient non-noble electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable but challenging for the commercialization of renewable energy systems. Herein, a facile strategy is developed for the synthesis of iron phosphide (FeP) nanoparticles protected with an overcoat of ""multifunctional"" P-doped graphitic carbon as a cost-effective electrocatalyst. The key point is the utilization of MOF-derived iron nanoparticles embedded in graphitic carbon (Fe@GC), which are synthesized via the pyrolysis of the Fe-MIL-88 template and subsequent phosphorization of Fe and simultaneous doping of P in carbon. Compared to the direct phosphorization of Fe-MIL-88, resulting in Fe2P on amorphous carbon (Fe2P@APC), this strategy gives easier access to phosphorization and P doping through pyrolysis temperature regulation. Higherature pyrolysis can also yield the graphitic carbon encapsulated nanoparticle structure (FeP@GPC), which increases conductivity and prevents agglomeration as well as dissolution under harsh operating conditions, and thus contributes to enhanced activity and long-time stability. The optimized FeP@GPC exhibits superior activity compared to Fe2P/FeP@GPC and Fe2P@APC, which is attributed to the modified electronic structure of FeP due to its greater P proportion than Fe2P together with the strong synergy between the nanoparticles and graphitic carbon. In detail, FeP@GPC exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 72 mV and 278 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2 for the HER in acid and OER in alkaline media, respectively, together with negligible degradation after 20 h, which ranks among the best Fe-based electrocatalysts."

"Governing youth politics in the age of surveillance Social Movements; Protest; Activism Drawing on case studies from around the world, contributors to this ground-breaking book explore a major contemporary paradox: on the one hand, young people today are at the forefront of political campaigns promoting social rights and ethical ideas that challenge authoritarian orders and elite privileges. On the other hand, too many governments, some claiming to be committed to liberal-democratic values, social inclusion and youth participation are engaged in repressing political activities that contest the status quo. Contributors to this book explore how, especially since 9/11, governments, state agencies and other traditional power holders around the globe have reacted to political dissent authored by young people. While the â€˜needâ€™ to enhance â€˜youth political participationâ€™ is promoted, the cases in this book document how states are using everything from surveillance, summary offences, expulsion from universities, â€˜gag lawsâ€™ and â€˜antiterrorismâ€™ legislation, and even imprisonment to repress certain forms of young peopleâ€™s political activism. These responses diminish the public sphere and create civic spaces hostile to political participation by any citizen. This book forms part of The Criminalization of Political Dissent series. It documents and interprets the many ways contemporary governments and agencies now routinely use various techniques to repress and criminalise political dissent."
"The Impact of Multilingualism on Reporting Domestic Violence in Mozambique Portugal; FRELIMO; Estado Novo This article examines the linguistic environment in which police and justice agencies conduct interviews in domestic violence cases in Maputo, Mozambique. In Maputo, most people speak one or more African languages and many do not speak the official language, Portuguese, fluently. Moreover, a complex justice environment in Maputo incorporates customary law such as community-based mediation. This article examines justice and civil society stakeholder attitudes towards the role of language in the justice system. Interviews with staff from ten agencies indicate that stakeholders recognise the positive value for victim- survivors of domestic violence to tell their story in their own language. However, stakeholder agencies sometimes act as â€œlinguistic gate-keepersâ€ and the authors conclude that a suitable first step in improving the stateâ€™s response to domestic violence is the development of tools to support agency staff at all levels in explaining legal terminology and processes in simple Portuguese, or local language translations."

"Towards action research with trans women sex workers: Policy, space and social challenges Gender Dysphoria; Transgender Persons; Transsexualism Trans women face multiple social, economic and health inequalities and the impact of gender oppression and violence is even more profoundly experienced by trans women sex workers, although in culturally specific ways. This paper presents a pilot study conducted to explore and engage with the context of trans women sex workers in Lido Tre Archi, Italy. In line with the community psychology values of social justice, social change and participation, we outline our engagement process and key challenges observed when attempting action research with such a highly marginalised group. Data were collected in the form of ethnographic notes from informal consultations with different stakeholders and participant observations, and of documents (newspaper articles, picture captions) and were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings are organised in three themes relating to the social, policy and physical context in Lido Tre Archi demonstrating evidence of the contextual challenges and how they intertwine to generate a spiral of marginalisation and social exclusion for the participants. We take a collaborative and reflexive stance in our work and conclude with recommended steps and potential limitations to initiate an action research project."
"Experimental investigation of high replacement of cement by pumice in cement mortar: A mechanical, durability and microstructural study Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali Pozzolanic materials have long been used to enhance the mechanical and durability properties of mortar and concrete. It also helps in economizing mortar and concrete construction along with the reuse of certain waste materials. This study aimed to utilize pumice in cement mortar at high contents and evaluate its influence on the mechanical and durability properties, as well as microstructure of mortar specimens. For this purpose, different percentages of cement up to 40% were replaced with pumice. A series of tests such as compression strength, flexure strength, porosity, acid attack resistance, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), and SEM-EDX analyses were conducted. The results show that the sample C80â€“P20 (80% cement and 20% pumice) had 9.8% higher compressive strength and 36% lower porosity than the control group after 90 days curing period. The inclusion of pumice led to a higher resistance against acid attack as the control sample severely deteriorated and lost about 30% mass, while the sample C60â€“P40 lost only 10% mass. The FTIR, TGA and SEM-EDX tests also confirmed the pozzolanic reactivity of pumice thereby, justifying the improved mechanical and durability performance of the samples incorporating pumice."

"Zooming in on the workplace bullying and turnover intentions pathway: The role of well-being and a cultural boundary condition Mobbing; Incivility; Nurses Purpose: Despite the well-established association between workplace bullying and turnover intentions, the mechanisms underlying this relationship and its boundary conditions remain understudied. The purpose of this paper is to examine employee affective well-being as a mediating mechanism by which exposure to workplace bullying may trigger employee intentions to leave the workplace. It also aims to explore the role of national culture in moderating the effects of workplace bullying on employee well-being and turnover intentions. Design/methodology/approach: This research is conducted through a cross-cultural analysis of data obtained from 627 Australian and Pakistani employees. Findings: The findings reveal that exposure to workplace bullying triggers turnover intentions through its negative effect on affective well-being in cross-cultural/national contexts. However, national culture moderates these effects such that the effects of workplace bullying on well-being and turnover intentions are weaker for Pakistanis than for Australians. Originality/value: This paper reports original research that deepens the understanding of how, why and when exposure to workplace bullying will prompt employees to leave the workplace in a cross-national context. The research findings will assist international organisations in designing strategies tailored to the national culture in order to mitigate the adverse effects of workplace bullying on staff turnover."

"The Disability and Wellbeing Monitoring Framework: data, data gaps, and policy implications Physical Disability; Health Services Accessibility; Panel Survey Objective: To develop a framework and indicators to monitor inequalities in health and the social determinants of health for Australians with disability. Methods: The development drew on existing frameworks and input from people with lived experience of disability. Results: The Disability and Wellbeing Monitoring Framework has 19 domains. Australian national data are available for 73% of the 128 indicators in these domains. Data gaps and limitations include the absence of national data and the absence of disability identifiers in some data sources. Conclusions: The framework will be used to report baseline data for people with and without disability and to monitor inequalities over time in Australia. It will also be used to locate policy priorities and focus efforts to address data gaps. Implications for public health: Inequality between people with and without disability in relation to health and the social determinants of health is a public health issue that warrants greater attention than it has received to date. The framework provides a robust, evidence-informed tool to address the health inequalities of people with disability, inform the development of effective policy and practice responses, and monitor change over time."

"Freedom of speech is not freedom from ethics: the 2019 Israel Folau media controversy as a case study News Media; Framing; Journalism This article examines how freedom of speech is framed in the media controversy surrounding the Australian rugby player Israel Folauâ€™s April 2019 Instagram post. A content analysis and framing analysis of newspaper reportage reveals that the controversy has been largely discussed in terms of whether or not Folauâ€™s speech was being curtailed and whether this curtailing indicates a broader, ideologically motivated censoriousness. This discussion is problematic in that it says little about the actual substance of Folauâ€™s post. This article argues that debates surrounding freedom of speech such as the one involving Folau could and should be enriched by an engagement with ethical principles. This engagement is premised on a commitment to the free exchange of views, while acknowledging that â€˜speechâ€™ is not always inherently beneficial for democracy, nor worth defending."

"Social Mix: Measuring the benefits for low-income households Social mix, by including social housing tenures in private developments, is a widely used mechanism for improving housing affordability and access to social housing. Yet there is little evidence about its benefits despite growing interest in mechanisms such as inclusionary zoning. This research project will deliver a baseline of practitioner and resident perspectives about what works in socially mixed housing developments, using Nightingale Village as a case study. The project will document and examine the management and delivery of the social mix approach at Nightingale Village, evaluate the likely population diversity outcomes, and document the perspectives of prospective residents. The study will use quantitative and qualitative methods. Secondary data will provide a baseline social mix of population diversity at the neighbourhood scale and a projected social mix outcome once complete. Interviews with project developers and community housing providers will gather data about the delivery model and approach, and with prospective residents about their perceptions. The findings will provide an evidence base about the application of social mix principles in a purposeful development and to what extent social mix contributes to more diverse and equitable housing outcomes. These findings will provide lessons to industry and communities to inform future projects."

"A Study on Discrete Mathematics: Sum Distance in Neutrosophic Graphs with Application Fuzzy Graph; Domination; Single Valued Distance is an important parameter in any networks/ graphs. The idea of strong sum distance in the fuzzy graph was introduced by Tom and Sunitha (2015). A generalization of fuzzy graph called neutrosophic graph is more realistic to handle imprecise data. In this study, the weight of an edge of a neutrosophic graph is defined and hence defined sum distance in a neutrosophic graph based on the idea of strong sum distance. This distance is also metric and based on this metric, the concepts of degree, eccentricity, radius, diameter etc. are studied with some properties.

"Defining student learning experience through blended learning Blended Learning; Learning Management System; Distance Education This paper aims to explore the benefits of Blended Learning towards studentsâ€™ learning experiences at an offshore campus of an Australian university located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. At the university campus, the Blended Learning practice in use is the displacement of content. Content displacement refers to a portion of the learning content and activities for a course being delivered online via the Learning Management System. Learning not only happens in face-to-face sessions at a given time but is extended to online spaces as well, happening anywhere at any time at studentsâ€™ preference. The focus of this research is its usefulness and effectiveness in promoting interactions between students and their peers, their teachers, and course materials. An online survey, which was designed based on a set of validated questions, was used to collect data from sixty-six students enrolled in eight Blended Learning courses. The analysis of the survey results provides empirical evidence to the claim that studentsâ€™ perception of their learning experiences at the university was beneficially impacted as a result of the Blended Learning environment in each of their classes. Specifically, factor analysis using oblique rotation method identifies a clear factor structure across survey questions, representing four dimensions of benefits: Engagement, Flexibility of learning, Online learning experience, and Self-confidence. In addition, significant differences between the clusters on these factors indicate that students vary in their responses towards the benefits of Blended Learning and their experience with a Blended Learning approach."

"Energy-related deprivation and housing tenure transitions Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Energy poverty is becoming an increasingly important policy consideration in many countries. We empirically examine the relationship between energy poverty and housing tenure in Australia using HILDA survey data over the period 2005 to 2018. We employ objective, subjective and composite measures of energy poverty and control for other respondent and household covariates. Results from our study, which are robust to a suite of checks, suggest that being energy poor has a negative impact on homeownership and â€œrent to ownâ€ transition, and a positive impact on â€œown to rentâ€ transition. We conclude by discussing the policy implications of our study."
"Sustainable development goals and indicators for circular built environment: regional comparison based on a global survey Industrial Symbiosis; Sustainable Development; Circular Economy This paper presents results from an empirical study about the interplay between circular built environment (CBE) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A global survey was deployed by the One Planet Sustainable Buildings and Construction Programme (SBC). This survey focused on how CBE is reflected in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the key indicators arising. The results of this survey, based on 185 responses is shared in this paper. From amongst the range of global responses, 56 were received from Europe and 96 from the Global South comprising Asia, Africa and Latin America. In addition to the survey, SBC has also collected 42 CBE cases studies from Asia, Africa and Latin America exploring their relationship with the SDGs. The importance of key SDGs: 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 are compared between Europe and Global South and also between Asia and Africa. Five global core CBE indicators and nine secondary CBE indicators are selected based on the survey and their priorities compared between Europe and the Global South as well as between Asia, Africa and Latin America. The results verify the importance of the SDGs in supporting circular outcomes for the built environment."

"Municipal solid waste management practices and challenges in the southeastern coastal cities of Sri Lanka Family Characteristic; Solid Waste Management; Cardboard Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) has become a major challenge in Sri Lanka for post-conflict development activities. Many urban areas are facing severe problems in managing 10 to 50 metric tons of waste per day. However, limited research has been carried out to identify the key issues and policy gaps in MSWM. This research studies the existing complexities of MSWM processes, practices, and emerging challenges in three highly congested urban areas in the south-eastern coast of Sri Lanka. A mixed method strategy using field observations, semi-structured interviews and secondary data sources was employed for the data collection. The study revealed that, although the MSWM systems in the urban areas include all necessary elements, their effectiveness and efficiency are not satisfactory due to poor or non-segregation of waste at the source of generation; lack of resources; absence of regulation to reduce waste generation and control polluters; absence of regular collection schedule; and lack of technical know-how and initiatives. The recommendations drawn from the study include feasible solutions and immediate measures required to improve the MSWM before the related environmental and public health problems become a social catastrophe. The recommendations will also greatly contribute in the achievement of developing sustainable cities."

"Effects of fire severity on the composition and functional traits of litter-dwelling macroinvertebrates in a temperate forest Carabidae; Pterostichus Cupreus; Beetles High severity fires are likely to become more prevalent with global climate change, so it is critical that we understand their effects on forest ecosystems. Leaf litter dependent fauna are likely to be particularly vulnerable to habitat loss resulting from fire, which often destroys their leaf litter habitat. We hypothesised that, as fire severity increased: (1) richness and abundance of macroinvertebrate litter fauna would decline; (2) species composition would change; and (3) species responses would depend on morphological and trophic traits, with proportions of larger, winged and predatory species increasing with fire severity. To test the effects of fire severity on the composition and functional traits of litter-dwelling macroinvertebrates, we collected macroinvertebrates using litterbags and standardised hand searches of logs at unburnt, low severity (ground burnt) and high severity (crown burnt) burnt eucalyptus forests (n = 7) in south eastern Australia, three years after fire. Litter-dwelling macroinvertebrates were larger, less abundant and less species-rich at high severity burnt than unburnt sites and species composition differed from unburnt and low severity burnt sites. Fire severity did not affect the proportion of winged species or individuals. Thus, we suggest small bodied species may struggle to recolonize through limited dispersal ability or may be limited by the drier post-fire environment. Increases in large scale, high severity fires may therefore result in assemblages dominated by larger macroinvertebrate species, but will also be associated with lower species richness."

"Innovative home ownership models in Australia (21/PRO/53249) Innovative models of accessing secure, affordable, and sustainable housing have emerged in Australia in recent years. Each pursues unique pathways and outcomes, but these are frequently conflated by misunderstandings and misrepresentations. What are these models? How do they differ? Who do they house? Does current housing policy assist their emergence?

The research will map the current evidence regarding emerging innovative housing models in  Australia to produce the taxonomy of models. This will be supplemented by knowledge generated by the ECR investigator through approximately 120 interviews with project 
instigators, residents, professionals, and government agencies conducted between 2017 and 2020. Additionally, to understand the market segments attracted to innovative housing models, data from two recently completed surveys of future residents of innovative housing projects will be analysed. "

"Public Sector Accountability to Implement Sustainable Development Goals in Sri Lanka: Influence of Traditional and Non-Traditional Donors Decision Making; Social Impact Assessment; Environmental Impact Statements Implementation of Sustainable development Goals (SDGs) for better environmental sustainability in developing countries in Asia has taken centre stage in response to the major environmental and social degradation created through rapid economic development in the region. Further, lack of clarity in environmental accountability of traditional economic developmental activities and internationally funded infrastructure development projects has resulted in reduced water and air quality and imperilled biodiversity. SDG related research in developing country context is limited and the impact of the funding bodies on public sector governance and accountability is scarce. This paper aims to fill this gap by addressing environmental accountability of public sector entities in internationally funded development projects in Sri Lanka, as a fast-developing country in Asia. The results indicate that environmental degradation is a continuing issue in Sri Lanka despite the efforts of traditional donor agencies monitoring and implementing environmental sustainability guidelines and SDG principles in infrastructure projects. The drastic change in the donor landscape experienced in the country with the rise of non-traditional donors and the deficiencies in public sector governance and accountability structures pose a significant threat to attainment of SDGs, including environmental sustainability in Sri Lanka."

"The status of and opportunities for utility-scale battery storage in Australia: A regulatory and market perspective Wind Power; Electricity Storage; Arbitrage Australia's electricity market is rapidly adding renewable energy generation. Utility-scale batteries could have a major role in facilitating these transitions; however, their deployment is still largely state-subsidized. We summarize the current and future roles for batteries from a legal-economic perspective in the context of Australia's electricity market framework. We find that the future of batteries in Australia is not only a function of the large-scale deployment of renewables, their cost development and the comparative future cost of competing gas turbines but also of national electricity market and state policy reforms focusing on reliability."

"How digital natives learn and thrive in the digital age: Evidence from an emerging economy Digital Divide; Internet Use; Education As a generation of 'digital natives,' secondary students who were born from 2002 to 2010 have various approaches to acquiring digital knowledge. Digital literacy and resilience are crucial for them to navigate the digital world as much as the real world; however, these remain under-researched subjects, especially in developing countries. In Vietnam, the education system has put considerable effort into teaching students these skills to promote quality education as part of the United Nations-defined Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4). This issue has proven especially salient amid the COVID??19 pandemic lockdowns, which had obliged most schools to switch to online forms of teaching. This study, which utilizes a dataset of 1061 Vietnamese students taken from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)'s ""Digital Kids Asia Pacific (DKAP)"" project, employs Bayesian statistics to explore the relationship between the students' background and their digital abilities. Results show that economic status and parents' level of education are positively correlated with digital literacy. Students from urban schools have only a slightly higher level of digital literacy than their rural counterparts, suggesting that school location may not be a defining explanatory element in the variation of digital literacy and resilience among Vietnamese students. Students' digital literacy and, especially resilience, also have associations with their gender. Moreover, as students are digitally literate, they are more likely to be digitally resilient. Following SDG4, i.e., Quality Education, it is advisable for schools, and especially parents, to seriously invest in creating a safe, educational environment to enhance digital literacy among students."

"Australia's push to make residential housing sustainable - Do end-users care? Green Building; Construction Industry; Project Delivery The Australian construction industry is transitioning to becoming more sustainable. Despite their crucial role, Australian communities as the end-users of this transition have been overlooked. Buildings contribute as much as 30% of the total waste produced and as much as 40% of total greenhouse gases. Residential construction makes up the biggest sector in construction; about 80% by cost. If sustainable construction is to be realised, it must take root in the housing sector. Little progress, however, has been made. Current literature places much of the blame with the owners and occupiers of houses â€“ The line goes that builders would build sustainable houses if people really wanted them. The question arises: are reported societal concerns for sustainability merely superficial or supported by intention and commitment to act. This study aimed to test public resolve for a transition to sustainable residential housing. Three focus groups, drawn from three diverse communities within the greater Melbourne metropolitan region, were engaged in describing and explaining community views on the desirability of sustainable housing. The unanimous consensus is that people want housing to be more sustainable, but that this is not forthcoming because of the intransigence of government and builders to facilitate a needed culture of change within the residential housing sector. This study contributes to the field, providing a model that encapsulates various dimensions of community's, namely, end-usersâ€™ perceptions, based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Findings provide a sound basis for future researchers to address the challenges identified. The study also raises awareness of policymakers and industry practitioners of the genuine needs and requirements of end-users of residential buildings."
"Literature review on the impact of welfare policy design on children and youth Child Care; Early Childhood Education and Care; School Readiness We review the empirical literature on the causal effects of welfare-to-work policies on the employment of low-income parents and the intergenerational impacts on their children. We focus on welfare policies that change benefit levels, activity requirements, time limits, and in-work benefits. These policies may affect children through several mechanisms, including changes in family income, time spent with parents, and attitudes towards work or welfare. To unpack these mechanisms and understand the net effects of these policies, we assess how the impact on children varies across outcomes, home environments and institutional settings. Overall, the literature shows that income tax credits are an attractive policy, simultaneously increasing employment and improving child development outcomes. In contrast, other policies that boost employment either have no or negative impacts on child development."
"TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND EMPLOYMENT IN DERIVED LABOUR DEMAND MODELS: A HIERARCHICAL META-REGRESSION ANALYSIS Community Innovation Survey; Marketing Innovation; Firm The effect of technological innovation on employment is of major concern for workers and their unions, policy makers and academic researchers. We meta-analyse 570 estimates from 35 primary studies that estimate a derived labour demand model. We contribute to existing attempts at evidence synthesis by addressing the risks of selection bias and that of data dependence in observational studies. Our findings indicate that: (i) hierarchical meta-regression models are sufficiently versatile for addressing both selection bias and data dependence in observational data; (ii) innovation's effect on employment is positive but small and highly heterogeneous; (iii) only a small part of residual heterogeneity is explained by moderating factors; (iv) selection bias tends to reflect preference for upholding prevalent hypotheses on the employment effects of process and product innovations; (v) country-specific effect-size estimates are related to labour market and product market regulation in six OECD countries in a U-shaped fashion; and (vi) OLS estimates reflect upward bias whereas those based on time-differenced or within estimators reflect a downward bias. Our findings point out to a range of data quality and modelling issues that should be addressed in future research."

"Transforming community well-being through patients' lived experiences Product-service Systems; Service Economy; Value Co-Creation The purpose of this article is to (1) explicate micro-to-meso linkages of well-being, (2) provide a theoretical framework to guide research on connecting patient experiences to community well-being, and (3) offer guidelines to policymakers. We develop a conceptual framework establishing connections between micro and meso levels through the expansion of patients' lived ecosystems. We introduce the concept of patient ecosystem management (PEM), an organizational process that focuses on treating patients differently in terms of assessing, managing, and expanding resources to achieve patient health and well-being goals. This process establishes a foundational perspective that is necessary to connect patients' ecosystems and to facilitate community well-being. Theoretically, this research creates ties between micro-level interactions and a collective measure (community well-being). Policymakers and healthcare professionals should take a PEM perspective, which will require new roles and behaviors, and leverage technology to expand and overlap patients' individual service ecosystems (intra-alignment), thus enlarging community well-being (inter-alignment)."
"Methane Adsorption and Separation in Slipped and Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks Organic Polymers; Triazines; Porous Understanding atomic-level mechanisms of methane adsorption in nanoporous materials is of great importance to increase their methane storage capacity targeting energy sources with low carbon emission. In this work, we considered layered covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with low density and revealed the effect of slipping and chemical functionalization on their methane adsorption and separation properties. We performed grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations studies of methane (CH4) adsorption and carbon-dioxide:methane (CO2:CH4) separation in various slipped structures of TpPa1, TpBD, PI-COFs, and functionalized TpPa1 and TpBD COFs as well. We observed that the slipping improves the total CH4 uptake by 1.1-1.5 times, while functionalization does not have a significant effect on CH4 uptake. We also observed improvement in CO2:CH4 selectivity due to slipping, whereas functionalization results in decrease in the selectivity. In all considered COFs, we found the highest CH4 delivery capacity of 141 cm3 (STP) cm-3 at 65 bar and selectivity of âˆ¼25 at 1 bar in 60-AB slipped structure of TpBD COF. We analyzed the molecular details of CH4 adsorption using binding energy, heat of adsorption, pore characteristics, and expectation energy landscape. Our results show that COFs with increasing profile of heat of adsorption with pressure have the higher CH4 delivery capacity. In these COFs, we found proximity (âˆ¼4-6 Ã…) of CH4 binding sites, resulting in higher CH4-CH4 interactions and hence the increasing profile of CH4 heat of adsorption."
"Challenging the entrepreneurial discourse around women home-based workers’ empowerment Informal Economy; Eurobarometer; Economic Aspect This article explores dominant entrepreneurship discourse and practice surrounding informal women home-based workers, and their relationship to goals of individual empowerment. We argue that conventional neoliberal entrepreneurship discourse conflates empowerment and performativity, linking the capacity of women to develop greater agency with their incorporation into an economic regime with predetermined roles, labelled â€˜empowermentâ€™. Applying a critical lens, we analyse the development discourse on entrepreneurship and economic performativity in these terms â€“ looking to understand the characteristics of empowerment concerning home-based workers in Bangladesh working for a fair-trade organisation and a domestic garment supply chain. We argue that the conflation of empowerment and performativity serves the convenience of neoliberal ideology rather than the empowerment needs of those to whom such discourses are applied. To complement our critique, based on the empowerment literature, we develop a conceptual framework of empowerment and agency encompassing individual and collective agency, considering these in light of the relationship between performativity and social reproduction. Coupling a more nuanced understanding of empowerment to the critique of the entrepreneurial discourse, as applied to women home-based workers, provides a theoretical contribution to the empowerment and entrepreneurial discourse literature.

"Designing super-swollen, sponge-like lipid nanoparticles for protein and gene delivery Protein and gene-based therapeutics or vaccines are emerging medical strategies with the potential to revolutionise current treatments for many complex diseases. However, these molecules are fragile and prone to degradation upon entry into biological systems. This study mission aims to circumvent this by developing novel drug encapsulating materials consisting of lipid nanoparticles with a sponge-like network of swollen water pores. "
"Liveability Assessment of Manningham City Council The Healthy Liveable Cities Group at RMIT University has recently partnered with Manningham City Council in their Smart Cities and Suburbs bid to provide a research, data and community consultation-based approach to improving the liveability of the Jackson Court Neighbourhood Activity Centre in Doncaster East. The bid involves RMIT University providing a Liveability Assessment of the area and Participatory Geographic Information Systems (PGIS) as a new method of community engagement. A Liveability Assessment of
Manningham will provide examination of important social determinants of health for neighbourhoods across
the Local Government Area (LGA) using spatial indicators. The selection of the indicators chosen for
neighbourhood investigation is central to the project's value and will be determined in collaboration with
project partners and guided by DHHS strategic direction with DHHS funding the project. The Healthy Liveable
Cities Group at RMIT University will calculate and provide a range of neighbourhood level spatial indicators
to investigate liveability across the neighbourhoods of Manningham and identify current liveability strengths
and weaknesses and future planning needs for these areas."

"Engaging accountants in value based healthcare: Strategic Performance Evaluation This research aims to advance the management accounting role in the movement toward value-based healthcare. Value-based healthcare is underpinned by efficiency and effectiveness in healthcare service delivery, and is positioned from a patient-driven value
perspective. This approach fosters technology and performance improvements which are currently confounded by business models that focus on volume-driven patient care. Fieldwork and interdisciplinary collaborations focus on the following research questions:
RQ 1: How do major healthcare service providers manage cost overruns and budget constraints, while supporting technological innovations that improve patient-centric healthcare journeys? RQ2: How can performance evaluation be improved to better support cost-benefit analysis of digital innovations in healthcare? Outputs of the fieldwork will support the development of a Continuous Professional Education (CPE) training module for emerging and professional accountants as well as healthcare clinician administrators. The training module offers a simulated hospital environment, whereby real data is used to support budgeting and performance evaluation training and engage administrators in strategic debate."

"Associations between microplastic pollution and land use in urban wetland sediments Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Microplastic pollution is concerning because it is widespread in aquatic environments and there is growing evidence of negative biological effects. Here, we present one of the first studies to examine microplastic pollution (plastic particles < 1 mm) in urban wetlands and investigate relationships between contamination and urban land use. Sediment samples were collected from 20 independent urban wetlands, each with different types of urban land use within their catchments. Microplastics were observed at all wetlands, with an average abundance of around 46 items/kg of dry sediment. Plastic fragments were the most common type of microplastic, accounting for 68.5% of all microplastics found. Consistent with other studies, microplastic abundance was positively correlated with increased catchment urbanisation. On closer examination, plastic fragments and beads correlated with catchment urbanisation. Fragment abundance also increased in wetlands with catchments that had a higher proportion of industrial land use and decreased in catchments with higher residential densities. This study demonstrates the susceptibility of urban wetlands to microplastic pollution, further highlighting the ubiquitous nature of microplastic pollution. The prevalence of microplastic fragments indicates that plastic litter degradation is a significant source of microplastics in urban environments, especially in industrial areas."

"What Are the Gender Impacts of the WTO on Local Communities?: South Korea’s Import Restriction on Sea-Squirts from Nuclear Affected Areas in Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident; Nuclear Power Plants; Dose In 2011, an earthquake triggered a tsunami off the northeastern coast of Japan, damaging the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant, which released nuclear material into the Pacific ocean. Soon afterwards, South Korea raised concerns about food safety and imposed a ban on imports of Japanese seafood from the Tohoku region of Honshu. The study reported in this article examined the impact of the South Korean governmentâ€™s import bans of Japanese seafood on women in that economic sector. The focus of the study was a recent WTO decision to uphold the ban, in spite of the fact that Japan is able to prove the seafood meets safe, approved levels of radiation. The research focussed on the effect of the ban and its continuation on the women involved in the sea-squirts industry in Miyagi prefecture of Tohoku. The article concludes that it is time for the WTO to consider the impact of their decisions on women and take womenâ€™s issues into account during their decision making."

"Emerging women leaders’ views on political participation in Melanesia Political Representation; Quotas; Parliament Existing explanations for why women do not get elected to parliament in Melanesia emphasize structural barriers to participation, including prohibitive costs and patriarchal norms. They are largely silent, however, on why those women who do conform to the profile of the â€œarchetypal candidate,â€ and thus have the best chance of overcoming these barriers, choose not to run. Drawing on an extensive qualitative dataset, including forty in-depth interviews with emerging women leaders from three Melanesian countries, we find that many women are pessimistic about the way electoral politics are conducted. Echoing longstanding critiques of political practice, this cohort conceptualizes their political activity as being conducted in a parallel public sphere, in contexts in which they consider themselves more able to pursue programmatic reform. Rather than focusing on structural barriers, we explore their decision to eschew parliamentary elections as an act of resistance against politics as usual in Melanesia. This new material adds to the literature on why women chose to run â€œfromâ€ rather than â€œforâ€ parliament and therefore has implications for scholars and practitioners interested in improving womenâ€™s parliamentary representation across the globe."

"Internalizing animals and ecosystems in social citizenship and social policy: From political community to political country Environmental Justice; Injustice; Air Quality The aim of this editorial is to explore, conceptualize, and research the need to internalize both animals and ecosystems in our understanding of social citizenship and social policy. This editorial should be seen as a brief overview of the themes that should be covered in the contributions to the Special Issue, â€œInternalizing Animals and Ecosystems in Social Citizenship and Social Policy: From Political Community to Political Countryâ€. This Special Issue argues the importance of integrating animals and ecosystems as a way to reâ€politicize humansâ€™ social relation with both animals and our ecosystem as in sustainable development and social policy. If environmental policy becomes social policy, we would reâ€construct social citizenship to include consideration for animals and ecosystems as integral part of social policy. This expansion in scope is a progression from seeing humans as part of a political community to becoming more involved in their political country. This aligns with the concept of Countryâ€”an allâ€encompassing term in Australia, involving a peopleâ€™s territory, land, water, biological resources, the complex obligations and relationships involved."

"Contingent Effect of Board Gender Diversity on Performance in Emerging Markets: Evidence from the Egyptian Revolution Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence The 2011 Egyptian revolution was associated with significant political and social upheaval, followed by societal changes and attempts by policymakers to reduce the marginalisation of women and promote their inclusion in the economy. Drawing on this background, the authors compare the effect of board gender diversity before and after the revolution. Results indicate that gender diversity in corporate boards is coupled with improvements in firm performance in the immediate post revolution phase. This evidence provides insights into the contextual factors related to diversity and performance relationship and supporting arguments for regulatory changes to further encourage womenâ€™s representation on boards."
"An online soil nitrogen content monitoring system using gas sensor technology Soil nitrogen content (SNC) is an important indicator which strongly correlates with the crop yield and greenhouse gas emissions. The effective monitoring of SNC can also minimise over-fertilization which is a ubiquitous problem in Australia and China. So far the measurements are mainly based on optical, radiometric and electrochemical platforms. However, these technologies are yet capable of applied widely in farmland due to their relatively high cost and non-continuous measurement nature. 
The correlation between nitrogen fertilizers and nitrous oxide gas emission provides a strong base to use low-cost gas sensor networks for monitoring SNC in a real-time and online manner. This project will involve the collaboration between RMIT University (Australia) and Intelirri Technology Co., Ltd., (China) to apply the patented nitrous oxide physisorption gas sensor technology (RMIT) into the smart wireless agriculture platform (Intelirri Technology) to develop the world?s first real-time and online SNC monitoring system. This project will align with the ?Food and agribusiness? priority area and expect to be last for two years. Researchers from RMIT will travel to Beijing to meet with delegates from Intelirri Technology for discussing the feasibility study and business plan. Intelirri Technology will not only provide their patented technologies but also the company-owned farms to assist the system development and evaluation.

"Laboratory evaluation of a novel multifunctional chemical solution for asphaltene precipitation and aggregation problem: Comparison with an industrial chemical solution Asphaltenes; Petroleum; Oil Asphaltene deposition in the near-wellbore area and within the pipelines reduces productivity and is costly. There are usually 2 methods to remedy this hardship that are using dispersants or inhibitors to preventing asphaltene deposition or using solvents when asphaltene deposits on inner surface of pipes or in the porous media. In this study, additive called AUT Force 110 has been developed and its properties have been inspected. This solvent has multifunctional efficiencies (MS) such that can be used as asphaltene inhibition and dispersion and dissolve asphaltene deposits. Furthermore, its performance is compared to an industrial solvent called PL5001 (CS). Analyzing the fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of the two additives were found to have polar functional groups of hydroxyl, thiol, carbonyl and carboxylic acid in their molecule. The existence of various functional groups gives the MS molecule the ability to interact with adjacent molecules through hydrogen bonding. In addition, aliphatic compounds were observed in the MS molecule with a low carbon number, which leads to its compatibility with crude oil. In contrast, the CS consists mainly of aromatic rings. Two carbonyl and ether functional groups were also observed in its molecular structure, which are very low in concentration compared to polar compounds of MS. Then, the confocal microscopy imaging was used to observe asphaltene aggregates with precipitant. The crude oil and n-heptane were combined in a ratio of 1â€“30 volumes. The addition of 100 ppm MS reduced about 87% of the mean diameter of asphaltene aggregates; while this reduction was less than 70% by adding CS. Also, adding MS narrowed the dispersion range of the asphaltene particles diameter to 2â€“16 Î¼m. The carboxylic acid and thiol functional groups play important roles in asphaltene dispersion in MS system. Both MS and CS delayed the onset of asphaltene precipitation, however MS has greater asphaltene inhibition power as well as improving the rheological properties of crude oil and n-heptane solution due to the reduction in the size of asphaltene aggregates, the interaction of MS with asphaltene, and the reduction of the interaction between the asphaltene-asphaltene molecule besides the polar nature of MS. Turbiscan test was also used to measure the solvation power of two additives. The solubility number of MS was lower than that of CS and was reported to be a good solvent, indicating that it has better solvation power than CS. Because MS has the ability to hydrogen bond with asphaltene molecules as both donor and acceptor. Secondly, its aliphatic chains cause steric hindrance, which contributes to the stability of asphaltenes within MS."
"Architectural modeling of transdisciplinary system with inherent social perspectives Hearing Aids; Very Elderly; Auditory Training In an earlier study, we had noted that the term transdisciplinary is used in describing a number of different situations but always implied some form of knowledge-sharing collaboration. Researchers have observed that the requisite knowledge lies both within a development team and outside of it, but how it all works in harmony may vary from case to case. In this paper, we explore the utility of a system architecture description standard, ISO 42010 as a framework for representing architectural knowledge in a consistent way. This is illustrated in a social innovation case study. The case also illustrates how knowledge from social, medical and physical sciences was combined at multiple levels within a telemedicine delivery system."

"Cytotoxic T cells swarm by homotypic chemokine signalling Signal Transduction; T-Cell Antigen Receptor; T Cell Activation Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are thought to arrive at target sites either via random search or following signals by other leukocytes. Here, we reveal independent emergent behaviour in CTL populations attacking tumour masses. Primary murine CTLs coordinate their migration in a process reminiscent of the swarming observed in neutrophils. CTLs engaging cognate targets accelerate the recruitment of distant T cells through long-range homotypic signalling, in part mediated via the diffusion of chemokines CCL3 and CCL4. Newly arriving CTLs augment the chemotactic signal, further accelerating mass recruitment in a positive feedback loop. Activated effector human T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells similarly employ intra-population signalling to drive rapid convergence. Thus, CTLs recognising a cognate target can induce a localised mass response by amplifying the direct recruitment of additional T cells independently of other leukocytes."

"Global, regional, and national age-sex-specific mortality for 282 causes of death in 195 countries and territories, 1980–2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 National Burden; Territories; Disease Background: Global development goals increasingly rely on country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation's progress. To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional, national, and, for selected locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly available data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2017. Methods: The causes of death database is composed of vital registration (VR), verbal autopsy (VA), registry, survey, police, and surveillance data. GBD 2017 added ten VA studies, 127 country-years of VR data, 502 cancer-registry country-years, and an additional surveillance country-year. Expansions of the GBD cause of death hierarchy resulted in 18 additional causes estimated for GBD 2017. Newly available data led to subnational estimates for five additional countriesâ€”Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia. Deaths assigned International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for non-specific, implausible, or intermediate causes of death were reassigned to underlying causes by redistribution algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty estimation. We used statistical modelling tools developed for GBD, including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to generate cause fractions and cause-specific death rates for each location, year, age, and sex. Instead of using UN estimates as in previous versions, GBD 2017 independently estimated population size and fertility rate for all locations. Years of life lost (YLLs) were then calculated as the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. All rates reported here are age-standardised. Findings: At the broadest grouping of causes of death (Level 1), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) comprised the greatest fraction of deaths, contributing to 73Â·4% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 72Â·5â€“74Â·1) of total deaths in 2017, while communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) causes accounted for 18Â·6% (17Â·9â€“19Â·6), and injuries 8Â·0% (7Â·7â€“8Â·2). Total numbers of deaths from NCD causes increased from 2007 to 2017 by 22Â·7% (21Â·5â€“23Â·9), representing an additional 7Â·61 million (7Â·20â€“8Â·01) deaths estimated in 2017 versus 2007. The death rate from NCDs decreased globally by 7Â·9% (7Â·0â€“8Â·8). The number of deaths for CMNN causes decreased by 22Â·2% (20Â·0â€“24Â·0) and the death rate by 31Â·8% (30Â·1â€“33Â·3). Total deaths from injuries increased by 2Â·3% (0Â·5â€“4Â·0) between 2007 and 2017, and the death rate from injuries decreased by 13Â·7% (12Â·2â€“15Â·1) to 57Â·9 deaths (55Â·9â€“59Â·2) per 100 000 in 2017. Deaths from substance use disorders also increased, rising from 284 000 deaths (268 000â€“289 000) globally in 2007 to 352 000 (334 000â€“363 000) in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, total deaths from conflict and terrorism increased by 118Â·0% (88Â·8â€“148Â·6). A greater reduction in total deaths and death rates was observed for some CMNN causes among children younger than 5 years than for older adults, such as a 36Â·4% (32Â·2â€“40Â·6) reduction in deaths from lower respiratory infections for children younger than 5 years compared with a 33Â·6% (31Â·2â€“36Â·1) increase in adults older than 70 years. Globally, the number of deaths was greater for men than for women at most ages in 2017, except at ages older than 85 years. Trends in global YLLs reflect an epidemiological transition, with decreases in total YLLs from enteric infections, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, and maternal and neonatal disorders between 1990 and 2017; these were generally greater in magnitude at the lowest levels of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). At the same time, there were large increases in YLLs from neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases. YLL rates decreased across the five leading Level 2 causes in all SDI quintiles. The leading causes of YLLs in 1990â€”neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal diseasesâ€”were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in 2017. Meanwhile, estimated YLLs increased for ischaemic heart disease (ranked first in 2017) and stroke (ranked third), even though YLL rates decreased. Population growth contributed to increased total deaths across the 20 leading Level 2 causes of mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in the cause-specific mortality rate reduced the effect of population growth for all but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases. Interpretation: Improvements in global health have been unevenly distributed among populations. Deaths due to injuries, substance use disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and cardiovascular disease are expanding threats to global health. For causes of death such as lower respiratory and enteric infections, more rapid progress occurred for children than for the oldest adults, and there is continuing disparity in mortality rates by sex across age groups. Reductions in the death rate of some common diseases are themselves slowing or have ceased, primarily for NCDs, and the death rate for selected causes has increased in the past decade.

"Adaptive occupancy scheduling: Exploiting microclimate variations in buildings Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Office Buildings Using natural ventilation instead of mechanical building systems to regulate indoor climate can reduce energy consumption while increasing human well-being. The feasibility of natural ventilation depends on outdoor climate conditions as well as the physical and architectural properties of a building. Based on the observation that institutional buildings are rarely occupied to full capacity, this paper proposes a building operation paradigm aimed at increasing the feasibility of natural ventilation. We introduce the concept of adaptive occupancy scheduling, a prescriptive system that allocates occupants in real time to populate only the most environmentally suitable spaces at all times. We exemplify this paradigm in a school design study, in which a fixed room schedule is replaced by a sensor network that assigns classes to classrooms with appropriate microclimatic conditions on-the-go. Our initial results indicate that a higher local architectural diversity generally increases comfort in free-running mode."

"Persistent organic pollutant (POPs) concentrations from great-winged petrels nesting in Western Australia Feathers; Birds; Grus Japonensis Marine animals that traverse coastal and offshore environments are potentially exposed to multiple sources of pollution. Baseline data of pollutant concentrations of these fauna are needed in remote areas as human populations grow and economic development increases because changes may affect local wildlife in unforeseen ways. Persistent organic pollutant (POPs) concentrations were quantified in an understudied seabird, the great-winged petrel (Pterodroma macroptera), that breeds in southern Western Australia. Organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) were measured in adults. Total POPs concentrations ranged 5.6â€“46.4 ng gâˆ’1 ww. The most frequently detected POPs were the dichlorodiethyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolite 4,4'DDE, the PCB CB-28, and the BFR polybrominated diphenyl ether BDE-99. These results contribute to the limited POPs data in marine fauna in this remote region, and the Southern Hemisphere, adding to the growing body of evidence that remote regions are affected by global trends of POPs distributions."

"Macroeconomic determinants of US corporate leverage Capital Structure; Firm; Pecking Order Theory Macroeconomic factors are regarded as important determinants of corporate leverage decisions, although their importance during good and bad times is less understood. We examine the effect of macroeconomic factors on total, long-term and short-term corporate leverage (debt to total assets) decisions during: (1) the expansionary and contractionary phases of the business cycle; and (2) the financial crisis (FC) and non-FC period. This paper explains leverage decisions for S&P 500 non-financial firms over the period 1985â€“2017. Our main results are as follows. Short-term leverage and interest rate are positively related. Long-term leverage, on the other hand, is negatively associated with inflation. Interest rate and inflation effects are stronger during the expansionary phases of the business cycle and non-FC period, while the impact of US economic activity is stronger during the contractionary phases of the US business cycle."
"Influence of soil moisture regimes on growth, photosynthetic capacity, leaf biochemistry and reproductive capabilities of the invasive agronomic weed; Lactuca serriola Plant Leaves; Stomatal Conductance; Photosynthesis Global temperatures are predicted to increase by 1.5â€“5.9C during this century, and this change is likely to impact average rainfall, with predictions that water deficit will perhaps be the most severe threat to sustainable agriculture. In this respect, invasive weeds, which have traits better adapted to drought stress than crops, add to concerns regarding crop sustainability. Lactuca serriola, an aggressive agronomic weed is thought to be a successful weed because of its ability to maintain high water use efficiency under drought conditions. In this study, experiments were conducted to examine the influence of different soil moisture regimes (100%, 75%, 50% and 25% water holding capacity (WHC)) on growth, photosynthetic capacity, leaf biochemistry and reproduction of this species. Soil moisture significantly affected plantâ€™s height, stem diameter, number of leaves and biomass. The highest plant height (115.14 cm Â± 11.64), shoot diameter (9.4 mm Â± 0.18), leaf area (1206.5 mm2 Â± 73.29), plant fresh weight (83.1 Â± 3.98) and dry weight (22.38 Â± 1.24) were recorded at 75% soil moisture content. A fundamental adaptation to drought was observed as plants in the 25% WHC treatment had the highest root: shoot ratio. Soluble sugars and total phenolic content were highest in the 25% WHC treatment and significantly different to 100% WHC which was a response to soil moisture stress to ameliorate the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species produced under stress conditions. Results also indicate that L. serriola can survive and produce seeds under water stress as more than 6000 seeds were produced per plant in all WHC treatments. In this study, there was no significant difference in the seed weight, number of seeds produced and their germination ability. This can have a huge impact on agricultural systems as the species can survive both under low and high soil moisture conditions. We therefore suggest that the demonstrated ability of L. serriola to complete its life cycle and produce biomass and seeds under water stressed conditions leads to the introduction of strategies that minimize weed survival while maximizing irrigation efficiency for the crop. A clear understanding of the ecological and biological characteristics of this weed will help land managers take appropriate control measures to mitigate the effect of this species on economic crop productivity."

"Precinct planning for active and public transport in growth suburbs Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Goals for increasing walking, cycling and public transport use are widely adopted in contemporary Australian planning. However, new and outer suburbs are often car-dependent and comparatively poorly served by other transport options. These suburbs, therefore, warrant special attention when planning for active and public transport. In Victoria, Precinct Structure Planning (PSP) is one instrument to influence active and public transport usage from the beginning. Drawing on relevant literature, document analysis and 30 interviews with stakeholders involved in the process, this paper investigates to what extent the PSP process includes active and public transport provision. The analysis is based on elements identified in the literature as being conducive to public and active transport: such as local destinations, mixed land uses, dwelling density and street connectivity. Moreover, we identify some key points of apparent tensions and trade-offs in the current PSP process concerning transport. While the PSP process is well established and has improved, there are some clear limitations to the effectiveness of planning for active and public transport, such as the low ambition for density goals. Importantly, there are also major issues beyond the actual planning process, concerning implementation, which need improvement if goals for facilitating walking, cycling and public transport use are to be met in new suburbs."

"The Role of Biochar in Sustainable Agriculture, and Climate Change Mitigation for Sustainable Cities Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Sustainable development is facing a transformation. One solution finding its place as a key strategy in a number of sustainable development goal areas is biochar. Biochar is a geo-engineered bi-product that is similar in appearance to charcoal which differs from charcoal in that the organic biomass waste from which it is created is heated in an enclosed chamber to low temperatures and deprived of oxygen. This paper investigates the latest studies in crop productivity, commercial viabilities, and the socio-economic options of biochar production at a local and international level in the pursuit of sustainability and climate change mitigation. In terms of sustainability the uptake of biochar as a model for sustainable agriculture is steadily gaining momentum due to its agronomic potential for crop yields, organic soil carbon, carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The economic viability of biochar production varies markedly around the world. The most promising opportunities for soil carbon sequestration have derived from voluntary carbon markets and government initiatives such as Australiaâ€™s Emissions Reduction Fund. The scheme promoted the integration of biochar in land use management practices at a farm scale. If biochar is to have a more profound impact on a global scale, then countries need to adopt a sustainable biochar strategy which is universal along with standardised sustainability protocols."

"Plant–Human Commoning: Navigating Enclosure, Neoliberal Conservation, and Plant Mobility in Exurban Landscapes Rangelands; Ranching; Amenities Conservation on private land in exurban landscapes is habitually framed around the private property parcel. Neoliberal conservation programs that position private property as exclusive territory for conservation action are compounding the property-centric focus of exurban conservation practices. This framing conflicts with an understanding of ecologies as socionatures that are geographically dispersed and temporally contingent, as well as the implications of landscape-scale species migration driven by climate change. Here we explore whether the agency and mobility of plants across property boundaries offer an avenue for more meaningful alternatives to exurban conservation that are not bounded by the territory of private property. The conservation practices of exurban landholders in Victoria, Australia, were explored through qualitative interviews and property walks. The mobility of plants in the form of spreading, seeding, and suckering through fence lines reflects a form of more-than-human territorial enactment that can bring attention to shared and relational ecologies, while unsettling the notion of control over conservation practice that accompanies property ownership. We explore the potential of the recent reengagement with commoningâ€”in the form of plantâ€“human commoning practicesâ€”to position plants as active collaborators in commoning, rather than as the objects of human commoning. Although attentive to the challenges of multispecies coalitions in conservation, we suggest that plantâ€“human commoning could offer new possibilities for conservation that is grounded in the affordances of plants, as a counter to neoliberal governance and the individualization and privatization of exurban landscapes."
"All STEM-ed up: Gaps and silences around ecological education in Australia Sustainable Development; Education For Sustainability; Ecological Literacy Similar to much of the world, the Australian Government has a vision for society to be engaged in and enriched by science which has, as its prime focus, building skills and capabilities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Simultaneously, the Governmentâ€™s policies and projects, including in education, ignore intergovernmental environmental initiatives, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). This article critically analyses the Australian Governmentâ€™s STEM and climate change education policies and programs, including Citizen Science activities, through an ecological education lens and finds many, and growing, gaps and silences in these areas. It compares the Australian situation with STEM and ecological educationrelated developments in several other countries. In the context of significant global changes such as the COVID-19 pandemic, this article argues that it is time for the Australian education agenda to take the Governmentâ€™s international responsibilities seriously, include meaningful engagement with climate change and biodiversity related topics through ecological education in the school curriculum, and discusses what a reimagined school science curriculum could look like."

"Integrating teaching and learning with inter-disciplinary action research in support of climate resilient urban development Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience The capital cities of the South Pacific are experiencing rapid urbanisation pressures as increasing numbers of people migrate to the primary cities either in search of employment and greater access to healthcare and education, or as a consequence of environmental 'push' factors. However, the limited capacity of municipal Governments to respond to the scale and pace of change is leading to a growth of informal settlements in peri-urban locations. Factors of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity combine to make these informal settlements the most vulnerable areas to natural hazards. In response to this critical urban resilience agenda, this paper looks at how participatory action research is providing inter-disciplinary scientific support for the implementation of urban resilience and climate actions in Honiara, Solomon Islands. Adaptation measures involve a combination of hard and soft actions; as well as activities designed to strengthen local capacity to respond to contemporary resilience challenges. Addressing the adaptive capacity component, this paper also highlights the opportunities for Australian universities to integrate teaching and learning with action research to achieve a substantive real-world impact in the Pacific region, as well as illustrating the capacity strengthening benefits that can be achieved through sustained engagement and collaborative partnerships with local organisations."

"The effect of moving to East Village, the former London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games Athletes' Village, on mode of travel (ENABLE London study, a natural experiment) Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Background: Interventions to encourage active modes of travel (walking, cycling) may improve physical activity levels, but longitudinal evidence is limited and major change in the built environment / travel infrastructure may be needed. East Village (the former London 2012 Olympic Games Athletes Village) has been repurposed on active design principles with improved walkability, open space and public transport and restrictions on residential car parking. We examined the effect of moving to East Village on adult travel patterns. Methods: One thousand two hundred seventy-eight adults (16+ years) seeking to move into social, intermediate, and market-rent East Village accommodation were recruited in 2013-2015, and followed up after 2 years. Individual objective measures of physical activity using accelerometry (ActiGraph GT3X+) and geographic location using GPS travel recorders (QStarz) were time-matched and a validated algorithm assigned four travel modes (walking, cycling, motorised vehicle, train). We examined change in time spent in different travel modes, using multilevel linear regresssion models adjusting for sex, age group, ethnicity, housing group (fixed effects) and household (random effect), comparing those who had moved to East Village at follow-up with those who did not. Results: Of 877 adults (69%) followed-up, 578 (66%) provided valid accelerometry and GPS data for at least 1 day (â‰¥540 min) at both time points; half had moved to East Village. Despite no overall effects on physical activity levels, sizeable improvements in walkability and access to public transport in East Village resulted in decreased daily vehicle travel (8.3 mins, 95%CI 2.5,14.0), particularly in the intermediate housing group (9.6 mins, 95%CI 2.2,16.9), and increased underground travel (3.9 mins, 95%CI 1.2,6.5), more so in the market-rent group (11.5 mins, 95%CI 4.4,18.6). However, there were no effects on time spent walking or cycling. Conclusion: Designing walkable neighbourhoods near high quality public transport and restrictions on car usage, may offer a community-wide strategy shift to sustainable transport modes by increasing public transport use, and reducing motor vehicle travel."

"The state of wildfire and bushfire science: Temporal trends, research divisions and knowledge gaps Fuel Treatment; Climate Change; Fire Severity Along with the increase in the frequency of disastrous wildfires and bushfires around the world during the recent decades, scholarly research efforts have also intensified in this domain. This work investigates divisions and trends of the domain of wildfire/bushfire research. Results show that this research domain has been growing exponentially. It is estimated that the field, as of 2021, it has grown to larger than 13,000 research items, with an excess of 1,200 new articles appearing every year. It also exhibits distinct characteristics of a multidisciplinary research domain. Analyses of the underlying studies reveal that the field is made up of five major divisions. These divisions embody research activities around (i) forest ecology and climate, (ii) fire detection and mapping technologies, (iii) community risk mitigation and planning, (iv) soil and water ecology, and (v) atmospheric science. Research into the sub-topics of reciprocal effects between climate change and fire activities, fire risk modelling/mapping (including burned area modelling), wildfire impact on organic matter, biomass burning, and human health impacts currently constitute trending areas of this field. Amongst these, the climate cluster showed an explosion of activities in 2020 while the human health cluster is identified as the most recent emerging topic of this domain. On the other hand, dimensions of wildfire research related to human behaviourâ€”particularly issues of emergency training, risk perception and wildfire hazard educationâ€”seem to be notably underdeveloped in this field, making this one of its most apparent knowledge gaps. A scoping review of all reviews and meta-analysis of this field demonstrates that this sub-topic is also virtually non-existent on the research synthesis front. This meta-synthesis further reveals how a western, deductive view excludes socioecological and traditional knowledge of fire."

"Digital citizenship in a global society: a feminist approach Children's Rights; Childhood; Children with Disabilities In an era of datafication, social networking, and globalization, â€œdigital citizenshipâ€ has become an increasingly relevant and popular concept employed by diverse societal actors to promote digital capacity, literacy, and participation. To date, however, limited scholarly attention has been paid to the role of gender power relations in digital citizenship discourses, theories, or practices. In this paper, we conceptualize digital citizenship as a status (what it means to be a citizen), a practice (what it means to act as a citizen), and an intersubjective experience (what it means to occupy the outside, inside, or liminal space of citizenship). We argue that an intersectional, multi-layered, feminist approach to digital citizenship offers a valuable way to first analyze gender subordination and exclusionary practices in digital societies, and second to guide action that promotes a feminist democratic project of transformation and empowerment."

"Technical scheme and implementation of national pilot large-scale bio-natrual gas project in Gaotai county, Gansu province, China Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production The use of agricultural organic waste to produce biogas and bio-natural gas (BNG) is one of the important technical means to solve the agricultural non-point source pollution problem in China, and the large-scale BNG project has become the development direction. This paper takes the national pilot project of the large-scale BNG project in Gaotai county, Gansu province as a research case. Process technologies and equipment, engineering design features and implementation effects were involved. Biological and chemical mechanisms of ""return slurry + inorganic fertilizer"" for dry straw pretreatment, control factors of high concentration joint anaerobic fermentation of straw/excrement, and technical advantages of water scrubbing biogas upgrading in application were analyzed. The engineering design ideas, such as two raw material channels, integrated process pipe gallery and cold area energy saving, were introduced. Practice showed that the project was in good running conditions with high system stability. After implementing the profit model of ""governance fee + gas-fertilizer combination"", the project entered a benign operation track, which could provide technical and engineering references for large-scale BNG industry development in China."
"Corporate ownership, efficiency and performance under state capitalism: Evidence from China Firm; Anti Corruption Campaign; Bank Loans This paper studied the relationship between business performance and the ownership structure of firms focusing on Chinese state owned enterprises (SOEs) using a firm level panel data set of China from 1999 to 2011. By classifying all firms into different types based on their ultimate controlling shareholders, we found that SOEs in general underperform in the marketplace than private enterprises. However, among the SOEs in our sample, the SOEs controlled by central government outperformed all types of firms because they offered the highest asset turnover ratio and lowest business administration ratio by receiving favourable government treatment. We conclude that firm ownership type and work efficiency are the main factors that influence the differences in firm performance. In particular, the performance of SOEs controlled by central government is greatly determined by the degree of government intervention, which is referred to as State Capitalism."
"The Performance of Rooftop Solar PV System in SouthEastern Australia: A Case Study Photovoltaic System; Tariffs; Solar The rising greenhouse gas emission caused by fossil fuel burning is a growing concern for sustainable living and the environment. Globally, over 33 billion tonnes of CO2 is generated yearly through fossil fuel burning (44% by coal, 34% by oil, and about 21% by natural gas). The power generation by fossil fuel accounts for a lion's share of this amount. Hence, power generation by renewable energy (especially by solar and wind) is an alternative way to meet the rising electric power demand and reduce CO2 emissions. Australia like many other countries is encouraging power generation by renewable energy. Within a short span of time, Australia has become a global leader for power generation through rooftop solar PV systems. However, limited information on the in-situ performance of solar rooftop systems is available in the public domain. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to investigate the in-situ power generation performance of rooftop solar PV systems and compare it with the predicted performance of such systems. The performance of two solar rooftop PV systems was studied and their performances were benchmarked. The study revealed that there is a significant variation in power generation between the same power generation wattage systems manufactured by different companies. The study also revealed that the power generation can be lower as much as 20% from the predicted performance of a rooftop PV solar system."

"Building capacity for a user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought in the Northern Murray-Darling Basin Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China Drought frequently impacts both the agricultural productivity and the well-being of farming communities in drought-prone areas of Australia, including the largest agricultural region in the countryâ€”the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). Improving drought preparedness of farming communities in the MDB could be achieved by building capacity for a user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought. In this study, a prospective I-EWS was investigated. Farming individuals were interviewed to inductively guide the selection of drought-related indices most appropriate for the study area. Based on interview results and desktop research, five drought-related indices directly relevant to the MDB were selected as inputs to the trigger levels for an I-EWS: the Standardised Precipitation Index, the Vegetation Health Index, Soil Moisture (percent of normal), the likelihood of exceeding median rainfall in a coming month, and the chance of El NiÃ±o. Based on these inputs, decision rules were formulated for a staged â€œWATCH,â€ â€œALERTâ€ and â€œDECLARATIONâ€ drought early warnings. These decision rules were tested for the intense dry period from 2017 to 2019 for five key agricultural Local Government Areas in the Northern MDB. It was found that all three stages of the drought I-EWS were adequately triggered, indicating that a warning lead time of 3â€“8 months could have been possible in the dry period. Data for the selected inputs are readily obtained from space-based products as well as national meteorological services and would be applicable to regions with limited observing networks or forecast capability. Thus, while the methodologies developed in this study and the resultant outcomes are tailored to the Northern MDB, this research ultimately serves as both a successful proof of concept for the drought EWS as well as a foundational base for the design of an operational user-centred I-EWS in susceptible to drought regions of Australia and other countries."
"Towards an integrated theoretical framework for understanding women, work and violence in non-metropolitan contexts Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Economics of Scale This paper proposes an integrated theoretical framework for understanding women, work and violence in non-metropolitan contexts. Despite the fact that the relationship between domestic and family violence (DFV) and the workplace is a growing focus of academic research, there remain certain lacunae within the literature. In particular, research that examines DFV and work in tandem is incredibly urban-centric, but also quite descriptive and a-theoretical, as well as quantitative in its methodological approaches. The lack of non-metropolitan research at the nexus of DFV and work is puzzling, given that established scholarship tells us firstly that DFV is more potent and complicated outside of big cities, and secondly that work is also harder to obtain and more complicated. In light of these issues, the current paper serves three distinct functions. Firstly, it operates as a call for the generation of new research that addresses limitations within the academic conversation. Secondly, it argues for the significance of research that illuminates the relationship between work and DFV in non-metropolitan locations; not only to address the existing knowledge gap, but also because the findings generated in these more â€˜extremeâ€™ scenarios may assist us in effectively addressing the DFVâ€“work nexus more broadly. And thirdly, to facilitate the production of rigorous and holistic knowledge at the intersection of work, DFV and non-metropolitan experience, the paper proposes an integrated theoretical framework for understanding women, work and violence in non-metropolitan contexts. Overall, it argues that such an integrated framework would necessarily need to account for the contextual factors of space and place, as well as feminist theory on work, and existing knowledge on both violence against women and the complexities of work in non-metropolitan contexts."

"How Specific Is Site-Specific? A Review and Guidance for Selecting and Evaluating Approaches for Deriving Local Water Quality Benchmarks Ceriodaphnia Dubia; Daphnia Magna; Metals Existing prescriptive guidance on the derivation of local water quality benchmarks (WQBs; e.g., guideline values, criteria, standards) for protecting aquatic ecosystems is limited to only 3 to 4 specific approaches. These approaches do not represent the full suite available for deriving local WQBs for multiple types of water qualityâ€“related issues. The general lack of guidance is inconsistent with the need for, and benefits of, local WQBs, and can constrain the appropriate selection and subsequent evaluation of derivation approaches. Consequently, the defensibility of local WQBs may not be commensurate with the nature of the issues for which they are derived. Moreover, where local WQBs are incorporated into regulatory requirements, the lack of guidance presents a potential risk to the derivation of appropriate WQBs and the achievement of desired environmental outcomes. This review addresses the deficiency in guidance by 1) defining local WQBs and outlining initial considerations for deciding if one is required; 2) summarizing the existing regulatory context; 3) summarizing existing guidance and identifying gaps; 4) describing strengths, weaknesses, and potential applications of a range of derivation approaches based on laboratory and/or field data; and 5) presenting a conceptual framework for appropriately selecting and evaluating a derivation approach to best suit the need. The guidance incorporates an existing set of guiding principles for deriving local WQBs and reinforces an existing categorization of site-adapted and site-specific WQBs. The conceptual framework recognizes the need to strike an appropriate balance between effort and ecological risk and, thus, embeds the concept of fit-for-purpose by considering both the significance of the issue being assessed and the extent to which the approach provides confidence that the ecosystem will be appropriately protected. The guidance can be used by industry, regulators, and others for both the a priori selection and the post hoc evaluation of appropriate approaches for deriving local WQBs.

"Environmental impact of discarded apparel landfilling and recycling Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing Globally, around 87% of discarded textiles ended up in landfill, of which more than 90% are reusable and recyclable. Recycling textile waste to other value-added products is economically feasible. To integrate recycling into the apparel waste stream, it is important to know the environmental benefit and impact of the different recycling options. This study presents the environmental performance of apparel recycling and landfill using the life cycle assessment methodology in terms of climate change, acidification, agricultural land occupation and water depletion. Landfill scenarios and recycling scenarios of post-consumer household discarded apparel waste have been developed in the context of Australia. This study finds that the landfill process of natural apparel waste contributes more environmental impact credit compared to synthetic apparel, and this is mainly credited from the power generation from landfill methane gas captured. This study also specifies that the environmental benefit from the landfill process of discarded apparel depends on the ratio of natural fibre and synthetic fibre in discarded apparel. Integration of recycling into the apparel waste stream can potentially generate environmental benefits. A recycling scenario of cleaning wipes shows the highest impact benefits, followed by cotton fibre, insulation material and polyester raw material recycling. Net impact savings of recycling depend on the avoided landfill impact and avoided virgin production impact. The results generated from this study can be useful for future policy recommendations on apparel waste management through recycling. It is clear that increased collection of apparel by recyclers can significantly reduce environmental impact."

"Fog Harvesting with Highly Wetting and Nonwetting Vertical Strips Hydrophobicity; Wetting Transition; Fabrication Highly wetting and nonwetting substrates have been widely used in fogwater collection systems for enhanced water harvesting. In this work, fog harvesting substrates comprising PVC strips of different wetting properties and widths ranging from 1-5 mm were vertically aligned and spaced apart at regular intervals to give the same solid area fraction of 0.8. Evaluation of the water collection efficiencies of the tested configurations revealed that 1 mm wide superhydrophilic strips was the most efficient, achieving double the amount of water harvested compared with 2.8 mm wide strips. This finding was attributed to the low Stokes numbers of the aerosol particle distribution of the fog which tended to result in them being brought by the flow streamlines toward the air gaps between the strips. Stagnant flow regions at the edges of each strip, revealed through potential flow calculations, then caused higher liquid imbibition and impaction there for water harvesting. It was also found that the Cassie nonwetting substrates that originally exhibited contact angles of 161Â° transformed to Wenzel wetting with zero contact angle within 60 min of fog interception. Optical profilometry revealed no obvious difference in surface roughness between the central region and edges of the strips, indicating that surface morphology was unlikely to be a contributing factor for enhanced water collection at the edges. The findings here indicated that highly wetting vertical strip architectures with narrow widths (1 mm) were favorable over wider strips for water harvesting provided that clogging and re-entrainment were not significant factors."

"Australian farmers left behind in the digital economy – Insights from the Australian Digital Inclusion Index Digital Divide; Broadband; Digitalisation Although Australia's population is concentrated in major urban centres along its coastal fringe, its less populous rural communities are important to society and the economyâ€”supporting sectors like agriculture, which occupies over half the continent's land mass and accounts for 2.2% of value added gross domestic product (GDP) (Jackson et al., 2020). The vast distances between urban and rural centres present challenges to the provision of essential infrastructure like roads, transport, energy â€“ and telecommunications. Within this last category, internet connectivity and skills are both increasingly necessary and historically less available to the regional and rural agricultural sector in comparison to other industries and geographic communities. The digital inclusion agenda in Australia aims to address such gaps by promoting and supporting people and communities to use technology to improve social and economic well-being. This article builds on research underpinning the Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII), which defines digital inclusion as the capacity of people to access, afford and use online technologies effectively. The article focuses on the nature and extent of digital inclusion for Australia's farmers (identified as farmers and farm managers) based on analysis of a customised set of primary data extracted from the ADII dataset. This analysis reveals generally low levels of digital inclusion in rural communities, particularly among farmers, with distinctive and complex characteristics across measures of Access, Affordability and Digital Ability. Our findings highlight a perplexing scenario in which farmers score poorly on the Index when compared to Australians who live in similar circumstances but are not employed in the farming sector. We attribute lower levels of access to limited internet technology options, lower data speeds, inadequate reliability and lower data allowances. Less affordability is associated with individual-level socioeconomic factors, along with lack of competition between service providers in sparse population areas, the comparative cost of building telecommunications infrastructure in the bush, and the need for redundancy in rural and remote solutions. Finally, lower digital ability scores reflect social, cultural and material practices on farms that have produced distinctive orientations to technology. We conclude the article by explaining the contributions of the paper to digital inclusion research and by making recommendations for policy development."
"Power system stability in the transition to a low carbon grid: A techno-economic perspective on challenges and opportunities Inertia; Asynchronous Generators; Wind Farms Increasing power system stability challenges are being witnessed worldwide, while transitioning toward low-carbon grids with a high-share of power electronic converter (PEC)-interfaced renewable energy sources (RESs) and distributed energy resources (DERs). Concurrently, new technologies and operational strategies are being implemented or proposed to tackle these challenges. Since electricity grids are deregulated in many jurisdictions, such technologies need to be integrated within a market framework, which is often a challenge in itself due to inevitable regulatory delays in updating grid codes and market rules. It is also highly desirable to ensure that an economically feasible optimal technology mix is integrated in the power system, without imposing additional burdens on electricity consumers. This article provides a comprehensive overview of emerging power system stability challenges posed by PEC-interfaced RES and DER, particularly related to low inertia and low system strength conditions, while also introducing new technologies that can help tackle these challenges and discussing the need for suitable techno-economic considerations to integrate them into system and market operation. As a key point, the importance of recognizing the complexity of system services to guarantee stability in low-carbon grids is emphasized, along with the need to carefully integrate new grid codes and market mechanisms in order to exploit the full benefits of emerging technologies in the transition toward ultra-low carbon futures.

"Bioactive variability and in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity of unprocessed and processed flour of nine cultivars of Australian lupin species: A comprehensive substantiation Sous Vide; Brassica Oleracea; Antioxidant The aim of this present investigation was to analyze bioactive compounds, as well as demonstrate the antioxidant activities of nine cultivars of Australian lupin species accompanied by observing the effect of domestic heat processing on their antioxidant activities adopting in vivo and in vitro approaches. Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis was performed for profiling bioactive compounds present in lupin cultivars. Multiple assay techniques involving quantification of polyphenolics, flavonoids and flavonol, electron transfer (ET) based assay, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)-based assay and in vivo assays were performed. The major compounds found were hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, 9,12-octadecadienoic acid methyl ester, methyl stearate, lupanine,13-docosenamide and 11-octadecenoic acid (Z)-methyl ester. Mandelup was found to show excellent antioxidant activity. Moreover, Jurien, Gunyidi and Barlock had strong antioxidant activity. Both positive and negative impacts of heat processing were observed on antioxidant activity. Heating and usage of excess water during processing were the key determinants of loss of antioxidants. Negligible loss of antioxidant activity was observed in most of the assays whereas inhibition of both lipid peroxidation (33.53%) and hemolysis of erythrocytes (37.75%) were increased after processing. In addition, in vitro and in vivo antioxidant assays are found to show statistically significant (* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01) results, which are supported by the presence of a number of antioxidant compounds in GC-MS analysis."
"Understanding the mechanisms driving the spread of subtype C HIV-1 Phylogeny; HIV-1; RNA Directed DNA Polymerase Inhibitor Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C (C-HIV) is the most prevalent form of HIV-1 globally, accounting for approximately 50% of infections worldwide. C-HIV is the predominant and near-exclusive subtype in the low resource regions of India and Southern Africa. Given the vast diversity of HIV-1 subtypes, it is curious as to why C-HIV constitutes such a large proportion of global infections. This enriched prevalence may be due to phenotypic differences between C-HIV isolates and other viral strains that permit enhanced transmission efficiency or, pathogenicity, or might due to the socio-demographics of the regions where C-HIV is endemic. Here, we compare the mechanisms of C-HIV pathogenesis to less prominent HIV-1 subtypes, including viral genetic and phenotypic characteristics, and host genetic variability, to understand whether evolutionary factors drove C-HIV to predominance."

"Individual socioeconomic position, neighbourhood disadvantage and mental well-being: a cross-sectional multilevel analysis of mid-age adults Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Background: Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with mental illness, yet its relationship with mental well-being is unclear. Mental well-being is defined as feeling good and functioning well. Benefits of mental well-being include reduced mortality, improved immune functioning and pain tolerance, and increased physical function, pro-social behaviour, and academic and job performance. This study aims to explore the relationship between individual socioeconomic position (SEP), neighbourhood disadvantage and mental well-being in mid-age adults. Methods: Multilevel modelling was used to analyse data collected from 7866 participants from the second (2009) wave of HABITAT (How Areas in Brisbane Influence healTh and activiTy), a longitudinal study (2007â€“2018) of adults aged 40â€“65 years living in Brisbane, Australia. Mental well-being was measured using the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). Exposure measures were education, occupation, household income, and neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage. Results: The lowest MWB scores were observed for the least educated (Î² = âˆ’ 1.22, 95%CI = âˆ’ 1.74, âˆ’ 0.71), those permanently unable to work (Î² = âˆ’ 5.50, 95%CI = âˆ’ 6.90, âˆ’ 4.10), the unemployed (Î² = âˆ’ 2.62, 95%CI = âˆ’ 4.12, âˆ’ 1.13), and members of low-income households (Î² = âˆ’ 3.77, 95%CI = âˆ’ 4.59, âˆ’ 2.94). Residents of the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods had lower MWB scores than those living in the least disadvantaged neighbourhoods, after adjustment for individual-level SEP (Î² = âˆ’ 0.96, 95%CI = âˆ’ 1.66, âˆ’ 0.28). Conclusions: Both individual-level SEP and neighbourhood disadvantage are associated with mental well-being although the association is stronger for individual-level SEP. This research highlights the need to address individual and neighbourhood-level socioeconomic determinants of mental well-being."

"Birth, life and death of the Victorian Education Ultranet Actor-Network Theory; Socio-technical Networks; Counterterrorism This article examines the development and ultimate demise of the Ultranet, a major ICT infrastructure project in the education system of the Australian State of Victoria. The case is interesting as it was a very large project, intended for 1500 schools and funded to $180 m (Au). The study traces the design and implementation of the project as a socio-technical innovation in education. Although there are examples of how this project worked very well, its uptake was less than anticipated. The study found that potential benefits from a very large project like this can be nullified by a number of factors including: change in sponsorship of the project, an over emphasis on security concerns, failure to enrol crucial stakeholders and a naive assumption by technologists that technology with potential benefits will always be accepted. The study also found that technology projects must be delivered where a need exists and one that, most importantly, is recognised by the stakeholders. This will also be the case in other education systems around the world. If resources are not to be wasted the problem must be clearly identified and its need accepted before a solution is proposed. The Victorian Government finally abandoned the Ultranet in June 2013."

"Deep dive into the Root Cause of Endometriosis to Develop New Diagnosis and Treatment Endometriosis is a chronic and debilitating condition, which affects around 1 in 10 women during their reproductive years, considerably impacting the physical and mental health as well as the quality of life of over 176 million women worldwide. It is a gynaecological disorder in which the endometrial cells that normally form the inner lining of the uterus grow outside of their natural location, most commonly on the ovaries, pelvic walls and other organs (such as the bowel). This abnormal growth induces chronic inflammation and crippling pain. In addition, endometriosis is commonly associated with infertility."
"Debt threshold for fiscal sustainability assessment in emerging economies Fiscal Sustainability; Fiscal; Intertemporal Budget Constraint This paper explores the debt threshold for fiscal sustainability assessment for 14 emerging economies during the period 1999â€“2016. The threshold point is identified as the level which, if exceeded, promptly raises sovereign risk to an unsustainable level. As such, we employ a panel threshold analysis to the determination of debt limit, which can serve as a distinctive feature from other studies on fiscal sustainability. Our results demonstrate that non-Latin American economies are considered to be sustainable in the short run, as their debts remain below the threshold bounds of 40â€“55% of GDP. However, the long-run sustainability risk may emerge from a continuous upward trend in debt paths, implying the need for rebuilding fiscal buffers. It is important to emphasize that fiscal sustainability is far more challenging for most Latin-American economies. This is indicated by their debt accumulation beyond the threshold level of roughly 35% of GDP which is relatively lower than that estimated for the other countries. Indeed, during times of high debt, emerging countries in Latin America also face higher default risk since their sovereign risk premium respond more strongly to debt rise. Their paths toward fiscal sustainability, hence, requires an immediate imposition of strict fiscal discipline to relieve the debt pressure."
"The business case for social housing as infrastructure Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Business cases and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) are conventional features of infrastructure decision-making processes in Australia, and are used to evaluate the societal benefit of proposed projects. However, business cases and CBA have been contentious in terms of design and deployment. Funding commitments are regularly made prior to the completion of business cases and CBA, diminishing their value as a decisive part of infrastructure development decisions. For social housing, business case and CBA processes could provide useful evidence of the wider societal benefits of social housing provision, but the nature of contemporary policy decision-making means that political will remains an important factor in investment decisions. The development of public infrastructure appraisal methods such as CBA can be understood as a consequence of long-term infrastructure investment creating a demand for improvements in assessment and increased analytical capacity in the public and private sector, in the context of competition for funding. This indicates a degree of circularity: ongoing funding to support sector expansion is important in promoting economic analysis in the social housing sector, which is also seen as a step towards increasing industry funding. There is a presumed association between infrastructure provision and economic productivity within appraisal processes and infrastructure agency remits. This relationship is recognised by public servants and representatives from the social housing sector, indicating that infrastructure conceptualisations may not be appropriate for arguing for housing as a welfare intervention, but more apt for proposals that generate employment outcomes, such as key-worker housing. Therefore, the pertinent question is not whether social housing is infrastructure, but whether such a conceptualisation is the best standpoint from which to found advocacy for increased social housing investment. The answer to this question depends on the purpose of the intervention. The resources required to develop appraisal methodologies and analytical capacities underscore the importance of choosing an appropriate basis for further development of social housing business case methodologies. Alternatives to conventional infrastructure CBA methodologies include: avoided costs financial appraisal; a public welfare conceptualisation; and the proposition that the whole of society values providing for those in need. These examples provide a stronger conceptual link to the welfare focus of the social housing. It is also possible that adopting social housing as infrastructure as a central argument for business cases may risk diverting funding to new areas of intervention, rather than increasing funding for providing housing for those most in need."

"Corporate Governance Reform in Australia: A New Institutional Approach Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence From an international perspective, Australia has been one of the leading jurisdictions for corporate governance reform. Its first corporate governance code predates the Cadbury Report, and Australia is also one of the few countries internationally to have been only marginally affected by the recession that ensued after the Global Financial Crisis. Considerable governance reform has occurred since 2007â€“8 in Australia, however; much of it occasioned by pressure brought to bear by institutional investors as a reaction to both traditional governance failings and also social and environmental concerns such as a growing awareness of climate change. Institutional influence is primarily associated with the compulsory retirement income system that emerged in the 1980s in light of an economy-wide union campaign. While governance structures are becoming more homogenous, institutional logics reflecting trusteesâ€™ concerns are driving and shaping this ongoing process. A new approach to corporate engagement has emerged under the influence of investor representative bodies such as the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors that is driving corporate governance change."

"Understanding the fragmentation of microplastics into nano-plastics and removal of nano/microplastics from wastewater using membrane, air flotation and nano-ferrofluid processes Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Nano/microplastics (NPs/MPs), a tiny particle of plastic pollution, are known as one of the most important environmental threats to marine ecosystems. Wastewater treatment plants can act as entrance routes for NPs/MPs to the aquatic environment as they breakdown of larger fragments of the plastic component during the treatment process; therefore, it is necessary to remove NPs/MPs during the wastewater treatment process. In this study, understanding the effect of water shear force on the fragmentation of larger size MPs into smaller MPs and NPs and their removal by air flotation and nano-ferrofluid (i.e., magnetite and cobalt ferrite particle as a coagulant) and membrane processes were investigated as a proof-of-concept study. It is found that a two-blade mechanical impeller could fragment MPs from 75, 150 and 300 Î¼m into mean size NPs/MPs of 0.74, 1.14 and 1.88 Î¼m, respectively. Results showed that the maximum removal efficiency of polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and polyester was 85, 82 and 69%, respectively, in the air flotation process. Increasing the dose of behentrimonium chloride surfactant from 2 to 10 mg/L improved the efficiency of the air flotation process for NPs/MPs removal. It is also found that the removal efficiency of NPs/MPs by the air flotation system depends on solution pH, size, and types of NPs/MPs. This study also found a less significant removal efficiency of NPs/MPs by both types of ferrofluid used in this study with an average removal of 43% for magnetite and 55% for cobalt ferrite. All three plastics tested had similar removal efficiency by the nano-ferrofluid particles, meaning that this removal technique does not rely on the plastic component type. Among all the process tested, both ultrafiltration and microfiltration membrane processes were highly effective, removing more than 90% of NPs/MPs fragment particles. Overall, this study has confirmed the effectiveness of using air flotation and the membrane process to remove NPs/MPs from wastewater."

"Turn signal use among motorcyclists and car drivers: The role of environmental characteristics, perceived risk, beliefs and lifestyle behaviours Traffic Behavior; Aggressive Driving; Anger Turn signal neglect is considered to be a key contributor to crashes at intersections, yet relatively little research has been undertaken on this topic, particularly in developing countries. Using a case study of Vietnam, this research aimed to explore the role of environmental characteristics, perceived risk, beliefs and lifestyle behaviours on the frequency of turn signal use at intersections. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to motorcyclists (n = 527) and car drivers (n = 326) using online and offline methods. Using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), key findings indicate that perceived risk, beliefs and environmental characteristics play a significant role in affecting the frequency of turn signal use among motorcycle riders and car drivers at intersections. While lifestyle behaviours were not found to be a good predictor of turn signal use among car drivers, they were found to indirectly affect turn signal use among motorcycle riders through the mediation of beliefs and perceived risk. The findings can help inform the development of more targeted measures to increase turn signal use."
"""The Global Marketing Conference""  Tokyo 26th-29th July 2018 Despite the growing interest in understanding the determinants of subjective wellbeing, significant gaps remain in the literature. One such gap concerns the understanding of the effects of social integration and/or social inclusion on wellbeing, specifically the role played by interactions with one’s neighbours and the important factor of belongingness. Using data from the Community Life Survey, this study examines the relationship between social integration and subjective wellbeing. We measure social integration along dimensions that have not been explored in the existing literature, including frequency of interaction with one’s neighbours, perceived strength of belonging to one’s immediate neighbourhood and country, length of residence in a neighbourhood, and trust in neighbours. We find that social integration is associated with higher levels of subjective wellbeing. Specifically, we find that higher levels of interaction with one’s neighbours (beyond simply saying “hello”) enhance wellbeing and the greater the frequency of these interactions, the greater the sense of wellbeing that they generate. High levels of perceived belonging, as measured by period of residence in the neighbourhood and a sense of belonging to the neighbourhood and to the country, generate positive wellbeing. Finally, results show that trust in others in the neighbourhood also generates positive wellbeing.

"Evaluating the application of the statistical index method in flood susceptibility mapping and its comparison with frequency ratio and logistic regression methods Landslides; Debris Flow; Susceptibility Statistical methods are the most popular techniques to model and map flood-prone areas. Although a wide range of statistical methods have been used, application of the statistical index (Wi) method has not been examined in flood susceptibility mapping. The aim of this research was to assess the efficiency of the Wi method and compare its outcomes with the results of frequency ratio (FR) and logistic regression (LR) methods. Thirteen factors, namely, altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, geology, soil, landuse/cover (LULC), topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), terrain roughness index (TRI), sediment transport index (STI), and distance from rivers and roads, were utilized. A flood inventory was constructed from data captured from the destructive flood that occurred in Brisbane, Australia, in 2011. Model performances were compared using the area under the curve (AUC), Kappa index and five other statistical evaluation tools. The AUC prediction rates acquired for LR, Wi and FR were 79.45%, 78.18%, and 67.33%, respectively. A more realistic representation of the flood-prone area distribution was produced by the Wi method compared to those of the other two techniques. Our research shows that the Wi method can be used as an efficient approach to perform flood susceptibility analysis."

"On the role of process parameters on meltpool temperature and tensile properties of stainless steel 316L produced by powder bed fusion Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) This research aims to identify how meltpool temperature is determined by process parameters in Laser-Based Powder Bed Fusion (LB-PBF) and the effect of meltpool temperature and heat treatment temperature on microstructure and tensile properties. The study illustrates how crystallographic features in 316L stainless steel were developed in response to the meltpool temperature and induced energy density of LB-PBF manufacture, and by post manufacture heat treatment. For this research, 25 samples based on a Taguchi Design of Experiments (DoE) with five parameters over five levels were printed. To improve precision, the DoE was repeated three times and a total of 75 samples were produced. A thermophysical-based analytical model was developed to measure the meltpool temperature and subsequently surface tension of the liquid in melting zones. Then, a statistical method was used to identify the effective process parameters in tensile properties including ultimate strength, fracture strain and toughness. The microstructural evaluation and crystallographic features were presented to identify the governing mechanisms for the discussed phenomena. This result verifies that the meltpool temperature is a driving factor for the microstructural evolution and observed crystallographic features. Results showed that samples with lower meltpool temperatures have smaller grain sizes, superior strength and toughness properties. The crystallographic analysis showed the weak texture and anisotropic properties are dominant by the preferred orientation growth. The geometrically necessary boundary values were also found to be a driving factor for fracture strain. The originality of this paper is identifying the effect of process parameters on meltpool temperature using an analytical model that is developed based on the thermophysical properties of the feedstock. Characterizing the effect of meltpool temperature in crystallographic features are also another contribution of this paper."

"Skilled labour shortage: a qualitative study of Ghana’s training and apprenticeship system Apprenticeship Training; Firm; Human Capital Theory The impacts of training and apprenticeship education towards building high-level technical and vocational skills that support human capital development and attracting foreign direct investment are being reshaped by global competition. This article draws on human capital theory to report on a qualitative study that explores skilled labour challenges within Ghanaâ€™s training and apprenticeship system through the lens of the demand side of employment perspective. The findings point to a training mismatch, lack of regulations and ineffective apprenticeship programmes, underinvestment in education and training, and outdated training programmes. The bottlenecks in the supply of skilled labour in Ghana are hampering the firmsâ€™ ability to find skilled labour across industries. We suggest improved social partnership between industries and training institutions, with increased government investment in training and apprenticeship programmes, as a way forward to address the technical and vocational skilled labour supply bottlenecks. Wider implications for the African region which shares similar developing contexts are discussed."

"Innovation or dividend payout: Evidence from China Dividend Policy; Firm; Ex-Dividend Day Since 2001, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has implemented a series of policies to ensure that dividend payments constitute a prerequisite of equity financing, which is known as the semi-mandatory dividend policy. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms from 2007 to 2015, we demonstrate that firms with more R&D investments tend to pay more dividends. This can be explained by the semi-mandatory dividend policy and the equity dependence of R&D investments. R&D firms are more likely to have equity financing needs and they have strategic incentives to pay dividends in order to access external equity markets. Such pay-for-financing incentives are stronger for firms with lower cash holdings and higher internal financing deficit. We further demonstrate equity financing needs as the underlying mechanism for R&D investments to positively affect dividend payout. In addition, we show that such semi-mandatory dividend payments adversely affect firm value and sustainable growth."
"Buckling phenomena in AM lattice strut elements: A design tool applied to Ti-6Al-4V LB-PBF Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies such as Laser-Based Powder Bed Fusion (LB-PBF) enables the manufacturing of high efficiency lattice structures. However, the LB-PBF processes inherently generate local geometric effects. The practical implications of these geometric effects on structural performance is of critical importance to effective AM design; however, these effects are poorly understood. In response to this uncertainty, this research compares predictive and experimental data for the structural response of LB-PBF lattice strut elements subject to compressive loading; this comparison is made for LB-PBF manufactured Ti-6Al-4V LB-PBF but is generally applicable to all AM systems and materials. This data provides insight into the influence of geometric design parameters, including: node and strut diameter, strut length, and manufacturing inclination angle. The effect of these geometric parameters on the associated critical buckling load, and the accuracy of predictive failure models is quantified. Furthermore, the eccentricity ratio, a classical measure of column efficiency widely used in civil engineering design, is applied for the first-time as a systematic metric to characterise the structural efficiency of as-manufactured AM strut element."

"Optimization and assessment of an off-grid photovoltaic–diesel–battery hybrid sustainable energy system for remote residential applications Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems Due to the increasing demand for electricity for the ecotourism areas like Malaysia, alternative energy sources are being required. In this research article, an investigation for the comprehensive off-grid photovoltaic (PV)â€“dieselâ€“battery hybrid alternative energy system design with an energy backup of a 5-kW diesel generator is represented. From the simulation and optimization results, it can be observed that 38 kW hr/day load demand combined with 5-kW peak load for 37 family units for an ecotourism areas of Malaysia can be fulfilled by establishing the proposed hybrid PVâ€“dieselâ€“battery energy system. It can also be observed from the optimization outcomes that the proposed hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) is the most economically feasible energy system and the levelized cost of energy (COE) is nearing U.S. $0.895/kW hr and net present cost (NPC) is U.S. $158,206, and the COE and NPC have been minimized according to the current market price. After collecting meteorological data, a complete simulation has been conducted with the other parameters to achieve an optimal solution of the PVâ€“dieselâ€“battery hybrid alternative energy system. The decrement of the CO2 emission can be compared to the existing results with the other conventional and HRESs. The simulation results from Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable software have been validated by using Photovoltaic System Tools (PVSYST) renewable energy platform. The analyzed energy system will be applicable where the meteorological conditions are the same."

"Data-driven trajectory-based analysis and optimization of airport surface movement Airports; Runways; Aircraft Landing Driven by the recent deployment of equipment and the availability of data, aircraft trajectories on the surface can be tracked continuously, and the detailed analysis of surface operations is enabled to measure airport operational performance and prepare for collaborative decision making. This paper proposes a hybrid approach combining traffic analysis and optimization to address the airport surface movement problem. Important metrics of surface management such as runway utilization, taxi routes, taxi times are extracted and characterized based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) messages. After recognizing the congestion bottleneck, a trajectory-based optimization model is proposed, and an adapted simulated annealing heuristic is applied to solve the related problem. Two concepts for optimizing surface operations: arrival taxi reroute and departure controlled pushback are evaluated. The proposed approach is illustrated for Beijing Capital International airport. Computational experiments show that a mean taxi-in time reduction of 5.1 min is achieved for the rerouting arrivals, and the mean taxi-out time is reduced by 3.7 min with gate holding strategy. This data-driven approach allows advanced characterization of complex surface operations and enables collaborative decision assistance tools for managing surface movement efficiently."

"Income inequality and subjective wellbeing: Panel data evidence from China Subjective Well-Being; Happiness; Life Satisfaction Using four waves of longitudinal data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), we examine the effects of income inequality on subjective wellbeing (SWB). We take a dual approach in measuring income inequality, and thus, we examine the effects of inequality using province-level Gini coefficient as well as between-group inequality or identity-related inequality defined as the income gap between migrants without urban household registration identity (hukou) and urban residents. We find negative effects of both province-level income inequality and between-group income inequality on SWB, measured by life satisfaction. Our results also show that the effects of income inequality on SWB is stronger for rural hukou residents compared to urban hukou residents. These findings are robust to alternative ways of measuring SWB and income inequality. In addition, we find evidence suggesting that neighbourhood trust is an important channel through which income inequality operates to reduce SWB. We suggest policies that promote trust in communities with high inequality with a view of addressing the negative effects of inequality on SWB."

"Naming Rights? Analysing Child Surname Disputes in Australian Courts Through a Gendered Lens Naming; English Names; Naming Practices Despite major advances in gender equality, patrilineal namingâ€”children being granted their fatherâ€™s surnameâ€”persists as a largely unquestioned norm in those Western countries with predominantly Anglo traditions, even in families where mothers retain their birth names. In Australia, when parents cannot agree on the childâ€™s surname, the issue will go to a court or tribunal, to be decided by a judicial decision-maker. Apart from Jonathan Herringâ€™s (2009) work in the UK, such cases have been little examined by scholars. This paper explores the question of whether child surnames chosen by Australian courtsâ€”a supposedly neutral and objective third partyâ€”uphold patriarchal logic or provide more equitable outcomes. Using a feminist critical discourse framework, we examine five recent court judgments about child surname disputes, and six news articles about these types of cases. While these cases are not a representative sample, we find that, despite the existence of specific legal principles relating to childrenâ€™s surnames, decision-makersâ€™ judgments were inconsistent and subjective. Furthermore, mothersâ€™ names tended to be granted to children when fathers were deemed to be â€˜bad dads.â€™"

"Microfinance and child mortality Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion Microfinance institutions (MFIs) offer targeted opportunities for the poor to generate additional income with a range of financial services including credit, insurance, savings accounts and money transfers. Aside from reducing poverty, microfinance can potentially improve health because it is the poor who are usually more constrained from health investments due to limited budgets. Furthermore, microfinancing specifically targets women, who are more likely to spend additional income on childrenâ€™s well-being. Finally, several MFIs have also begun to offer health-related services, such as health education, health-care financing, clinical care, training community health workers, health micro-insurance and linkages to public and private health providers. Using a new data set, this article conducts the first multi-country study of the effect of microfinance on child mortality, the health outcome, which is most sensitive to the effects of absolute deprivation. Our findings confirm that an increase in the proportion of MFI clients in a country is significantly associated with lower under-five and infant mortality rates. We conclude that if MFIsâ€™ educational and health services have indeed caused improvements in health outcomes at the community level, then it may be important for governments to complement these activities with similar campaigns, particularly in remote areas where MFI penetration is low."

"On the need for a nuanced understanding of “community” in heritage policy and practice Residence Characteristics; Narrative; Nations The alleged benefits of community participation in cultural resource management has been an article of faith in the international heritage community since the early 1990s, yet the ambiguous and multi-layered concept of community is commonly deployed uncritically. This chapter argues that â€œcommunityâ€ should be seen as an open-ended, never complete process rather than end-product. It suggests that heritage practitioners inevitably contribute to the creation of a sense of community at scales ranging from the local to the national. The projection of community identities can enhance or undermine social cohesion at and across geographic scales and the chapter argues that heritage practitioners need to work with a nuanced understanding of their role in the creation of community identities. The link between heritage values and community formation remains powerful but the power needs to be unleashed with due diligence."

"Making ecologies on private land: Conservation practice in rural-amenity landscapes Payments For Ecosystem Services; Payment; China This book explores conservation practices on private land, based on research conducted with landholders in the hinterlands of Melbourne, Australia. It examines how conservation is pursued as an intimate interaction between people and ecologies, suggesting that local ecologies are lively participants in this process, rather than simply the object of conservation, and that landholders develop their ideas of environmental stewardship through this interaction. The book also explores the consequences of private property as a form of spatial organisation for conservation practice; the role of formative interactions with ecologies in producing durable experiential knowledge; how the possibilities for contemporary conservation practice are shaped by historical landscape modification; and how landholders engage with conservation covenants and payment schemes as part of their conservation practice. The authors conclude with ideas on how goals and approaches to private land conservation might be reframed amid calls for just social and ecological outcomes in an era of rapid environmental change."

"Optimization and assessment of an off-grid photovoltaic–diesel–battery hybrid sustainable energy system for remote residential applications Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems Due to the increasing demand for electricity for the ecotourism areas like Malaysia, alternative energy sources are being required. In this research article, an investigation for the comprehensive off-grid photovoltaic (PV)â€“dieselâ€“battery hybrid alternative energy system design with an energy backup of a 5-kW diesel generator is represented. From the simulation and optimization results, it can be observed that 38 kW hr/day load demand combined with 5-kW peak load for 37 family units for an ecotourism areas of Malaysia can be fulfilled by establishing the proposed hybrid PVâ€“dieselâ€“battery energy system. It can also be observed from the optimization outcomes that the proposed hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) is the most economically feasible energy system and the levelized cost of energy (COE) is nearing U.S. $0.895/kW hr and net present cost (NPC) is U.S. $158,206, and the COE and NPC have been minimized according to the current market price. After collecting meteorological data, a complete simulation has been conducted with the other parameters to achieve an optimal solution of the PVâ€“dieselâ€“battery hybrid alternative energy system. The decrement of the CO2 emission can be compared to the existing results with the other conventional and HRESs. The simulation results from Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable software have been validated by using Photovoltaic System Tools (PVSYST) renewable energy platform. The analyzed energy system will be applicable where the meteorological conditions are the same."

"Social housing as infrastructure: Rationale, prioritisation and investment pathway Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Safe, adequate, affordable and appropriate housing is critical to health, wellbeing and social and economic security, but many Australians cannot find housing in the private market, and the social housing system, incorporating public and community housing, is under-resourced and manifestly unable to meet demand. As a form of spatially fixed, materially realised capital expenditure that supports a range of social objectives in areas like public health, economic development and addressing market failure in the housing market, social housing is a form of essential social infrastructure that warrants public investment. However, political will remains the critical determinant of the level of that investment. Policy-makers argue that cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and related business case techniques could be usefully applied to build the case for investment in social housing. However, the following factors must be considered. The core benefits of social housing are not easily quantified or monetised and are thus often overlooked or excluded from such assessments. The benefits attributable to social housing, such as social inclusion, education and employment, are not measured or traded in markets. They occur over extended periods of time and are often multi-dimensional. The use of public health evaluation methodologies may provide a better basis for social housing appraisal than other approaches (for example, the housing-adjusted life years approach, adapted from health economics). Investment in other forms of social infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, is typically based on the spatial distribution of need over time. Historically, this has not been the case for social housing. We analysed the extent and spatial distribution of need for social housing and the cost of its procurement in 88 different land and construction markets across Australia. The results show that over the next 20 years, 727,300 additional social housing dwellings will be required, with current-price procurement costs varying from $146,000 to $614,000 per dwelling, depending on local land values, building types and construction costs in different regions. Even with efficient financing provided by the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC), there remains a considerable funding gap. We undertook financial modelling to identify the most effective strategy to address this gap, finding that needs based capital investment (NBC) supplemented by efficient financing provides the most cost-effective pathway for Australia. A model with no upfront capital investment, reliant on commercial financing and funded by an operating subsidy is substantially more expensive."

"Effect of macro-synthetic fibers on the fracture energy and mechanical behavior of recycled aggregate concrete Concrete Aggregates; Construction and Demolition Waste; Mechanical Properties In order to achieve sustainability in construction industry, recycling of construction and demolition wastes in new concrete is gaining a lot of attention. However, extensive research is needed to explore the complete behavior of resulting recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). This study aims to investigate the fracture behavior, mechanical performance and microstructure of macro-synthetic fiber reinforced RAC. For this purpose, notched beam specimens were produced using three different replacement ratios of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) (i.e., 0, 50% and 100%) and three different dosages of macro-synthetic fibers (i.e., 0, 0.5% and 1% of volume of RAC). Three-point bending and other mechanical tests were performed to investigate the post peak behavior (residual flexural tensile strength, fracture energy and toughness) and mechanical properties (compressive strength, flexural strength and split tensile strength) of macro-synthetic fiber reinforced normal and RAC. Fracture surface analysis was also performed to develop the empirical relationships between number of fibers and post peak behavior of fiber reinforced RAC. Furthermore, microstructure characteristics of macro-synthetic fiber reinforced normal and RAC were also investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that reduction in mechanical properties of concrete was observed with the increase in RCA replacement ratio. However, increase in mechanical properties particularly split tensile strength of normal and RAC was observed with the increase in dosage of macro-synthetic fibers. Concrete specimens also showed increase in residual flexural tensile strengths with the increase in dosage of macro-synthetic fibers. RAC reinforced with 1% dosage of macro-synthetic fibers showed increase in fracture energy and toughness by 380% and 129%, respectively. A strong influence of number of fibers on residual flexural tensile strength and fracture energy of concrete mixtures was observed during the study. Microstructural analysis also showed the existence of bond between mortar paste and macro-synthetic fiber, which improved the mechanical properties and post peak behavior of macro-synthetic fiber reinforced concrete. Based on this study, it can be concluded that macro-synthetic fibers improve the fracture energy and mechanical properties of RAC leading towards higher ductility and better energy dissipation. Moreover, number of fibers strongly influences the residual flexural tensile strength and fracture energy of RAC."

"Unpacking the relationship between high-performance work systems and innovation performance in SMEs High Performance Work Systems; Personnel; HR Practice Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the black box between high-performance work systems (HPWS) and innovation performance in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Through application of the ability, motivation and opportunity (AMO) framework, the study examines the mediating roles of innovation-specific ability, motivation and voice behaviors between HPWS and SMEsâ€™ innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses are tested on data collected through a self-administered questionnaire from 237 SMEs in Pakistan. Findings: Findings indicate that human capital, motivation and employee voice fully mediate the relationship between HPWS and innovation performance in SMEs. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional research design and self-reported measures warrant caution for the interpretation of findings. Future research may consider a longitudinal research design and objective measures. Practical implications: SMEs need to invest in the adoption and implementation of HPWS that will develop innovation-specific abilities, motivation and voice behaviors simultaneously among employees that will lead to higher innovation performance. Originality/value: This is the first study of its kind utilizing an AMO framework to investigate the underlying mechanism through which HPWS affect innovation performance in SMEs."

"The effects of offshore production on onshore innovation: Evidence from Japanese multinationals Subsidiaries; Innovation; Headquarters This paper examines a largely unexplored channel of the effects of offshore production on onshore (domestic) innovation performance. We combine a comprehensive dataset mapping the global operations of Japanese multinational firms with patent statistics to measure innovation. The study finds that increased offshore production have little effects on onshore innovation performance once properly correcting a simultaneity bias. Furthermore, we find some weak evidence of increased offshore production downgrades the quality of innovation, measured by citations. Consistent with other studies, we find that an increase in overseas R&D is the main driver of innovation creation for multinational firms."

"A comparative modeling study on nonclimatic and climatic risk assessment on Asian Tiger Mosquito (Aedes albopictus) Aedes Albopictus; Culicidae; Aedes Aedes albopictus, the Asian Tiger Mosquito, vector of Chikungunya, Dengue Fever and Zika viruses, has proven its hardy adaptability in expansion from its natural Asian, forest edge, tree hole habitat on the back of international trade transportation, re-establishing in temperate urban surrounds, in a range of water receptacles and semi-enclosures of organic matter. Conventional aerial spray mosquito vector controls focus on wetland and stagnant water expanses, proven to miss the protected hollows and crevices favoured by Ae. albopictus. New control or eradication strategies are thus essential, particular in light of potential expansions in the southeastern and eastern USA. Successful regional vector control strategies require risk level analysis. Should strategies prioritize regions with non-climatic or climatic suitability parameters for Ae. albopictus? Our study used current Ae. albopictus distribution data to develop two independent models: (i) regions with suitable non-climatic factors, and (ii) regions with suitable climate for Ae. albopictus in southeastern USA. Non-climatic model processing used Evidential Belief Function (EBF), together with six geographical conditioning factors (raster data layers), to establish the probability index. Validation of the analysis results was estimated with area under the curve (AUC) using Ae. albopictus presence data. Climatic modeling was based on two General Circulation Models (GCMs), Miroc3.2 and CSIRO-MK30 running the RCP 8.5 scenario in MaxEnt software. EBF non- climatic model results achieved a 0.70 prediction rate and 0.73 success rate, confirming suitability of the study site regions for Ae. albopictus establishment. The climatic model results showed the best-fit model comprised Coldest Quarter Mean Temp, Precipitation of Wettest Quarter and Driest Quarter Precipitation factors with mean AUC value of 0.86. Both GCMs showed that the whole study site is highly suitable and will remain suitable climatically, according to the prediction for 2055, for Ae. albopictus expansion."

"Comparison of mechanical properties and energy absorption of sheet-based and strut-based gyroid cellular structures with graded densities Lattice Structure; Three-Dimensional Printing; Sandwich Beam Bio-inspired functionally graded cellular materials (FGCM) have improved performance in energy absorption compared with a uniform cellular material (UCM). In this work, sheet-based and strut-based gyroid cellular structures with graded densities are designed and manufactured by stereo-lithography (SLA). For comparison, uniform structures are also designed and manufactured, and the graded structures are generated with different gradients. The mechanical behaviors of these structures under compressive loads are investigated. Furthermore, the anisotropy and effective elastic modulus of sheet-based and strut-based unit gyroid cellular structures are estimated by a numerical homogenization method. On the one hand, it is found from the numerical results that the sheet-based gyroid tends to be isotropic, and the elastic modulus of sheet-based gyroid is larger than the strut-based gyroid at the same volume fraction. On the other hand, the graded cellular structure has novel deformation and mechanical behavior. The uniform structure exhibits overall deformation and collapse behavior, whereas the graded cellular structure shows layer-by-layer deformation and collapse behavior. Furthermore, the uniform sheet-based gyroid is not only stiffer but also better in energy absorption capacity than the uniform strut-based gyroid structure. Moreover, the graded cellular structures have better energy absorption capacity than the uniform structures. These significant findings indicate that sheet-based gyroid cellular structure with graded densities have potential applications in various industrial applications, such as in crashworthiness."

"Practicing decolonial political geography: Island perspectives on neocolonialism and the China threat discourse Small Islands; Overseas Territories; Tourism Island peoples around the world remain entangled in colonial processes. Western and metropolitan powers are increasingly deploying discourse of a â€˜China threatâ€™ to justify neocolonial entrenchment in the form of greater Western militarisation and economic dominance. In this paper, we investigate how Western and metropolitan powers use the China threat and warnings of economic, environmental, demographic, and military disaster to maintain and deepen colonial influence in former colonies, with special focus on four island states and territories: GuÃ¥han/Guam in Oceania, Kalaallit Nunaat/Greenland in the Arctic, Okinawa in East Asia, and Jamaica in the Caribbean. We undertake this investigation as a means of practicing decolonial political geography, collaborating as a group of scholars from around the world and drawing upon diverse epistemologies and experiences to inform collaborative research and writing. Due to the complexities we have confronted in our efforts to think outside coloniality, this paper foregrounds our decolonial methodology and process, even as we respect our empirical findings."

"Toward sustainable environmental quality: Identifying priority research questions for Latin America PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs The Global Horizon Scanning Project (GHSP) is an innovative initiative that aims to identify important global environmental quality research needs. Here we report 20 key research questions from Latin America (LA). Members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) LA and other scientists from LA were asked to submit research questions that would represent priority needs to address in the region. One hundred questions were received, then partitioned among categories, examined, and some rearranged during a workshop in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Twenty priority research questions were subsequently identified. These research questions included developing, improving, and harmonizing across LA countries methods for 1) identifying contaminants and degradation products in complex matrices (including biota); 2) advancing prediction of contaminant risks and effects in ecosystems, addressing lab-to-field extrapolation challenges, and understanding complexities of multiple stressors (including chemicals and climate change); and 3) improving management and regulatory tools toward achieving sustainable development. Whereas environmental contaminants frequently identified in these key questions were pesticides, pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors or modulators, plastics, and nanomaterials, commonly identified environmental challenges were related to agriculture, urban effluents, solid wastes, pulp and paper mills, and natural extraction activities. Several interesting research topics included assessing and preventing pollution impacts on conservation protected areas, integrating environment and health assessments, and developing strategies for identification, substitution, and design of less hazardous chemicals (e.g., green chemistry). Finally, a recurrent research need included developing an understanding of differential sensitivity of regional species and ecosystems to environmental contaminants and other stressors. Addressing these critical questions will support development of long-term strategic research efforts to advance more sustainable environmental quality and protect public health and the environment in LA.

"The behavioral additionality effects of a tax incentive program on firms’ composition of R&D investment Firm; Subsidies; Tax Incentives This paper investigates the behavioral additionality effects of a unique high- and new- technology enterprise (HNTE) program in China. The program provides a reduced corporate income tax to certificated HNTEs. By distinguishing research expenses from development costs, we examine if the tax incentive program affects firmsâ€™ composition of R&D investment, based on a sample of Chinese listed firms. The results indicate that the tax incentive program encourages firms to focus more on development than on research. The effects are also found to be heterogeneous among the first-time, repeated, and one-time certification users. The results imply that tax incentives prompt firms to invest in short-term development opportunities with promising private returns. Conversely, they are less likely to stimulate risky research projects with potential high rates of social and long-term economic returns. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the behavioral additionality effects for innovation policy evaluations and better policy designs."

"Factors influencing green building development in Kazakhstan Green Building; Construction Industry; Project Delivery Green buildings have been actively spreading as a solution for sustainability issues of the construction industry in at least the last two decades. As green building practices unfold in developing countries, the need of identifying factors that both hinder and drive its spread rises. Multiple studies reveal a general inconsistency among results in different parts of the world, caused by each countryâ€™s environmental, economic, and social conditions. Taking into account the experience of developing international green buildings and the current state of green building development in Kazakhstan, this study aims to spread the understanding of the factors that hinder and have the potential to drive the development of green buildings in Kazakhstan. A questionnaire survey was carried out among 38 industry experts in Kazakhstan to accomplish study objectives. Multiple data analysis methods were used to identify correlations among groups of experts and rank the factors. The results revealed a lack of skill/experience, a lack of government support, and the high cost of sustainable materials and products as the most crucial barriers. Water and energy efficiency, improved health of occupants, comfort, and satisfaction were identified as the most influential drivers. By expanding knowledge on factors affecting the implementation of green buildings, the study uncovered common trends in the responses of professionals, providing valuable information for field professionals and suggesting future research recommendations."

We propose that educators can influence the attitudes of learners toward their courses through the andragogical design of learner-centered syllabi, before they even meet with their students in class. We review social entrepreneurship syllabi from universities from around the world. Our findings demonstrate that, over time, there has been a move from instructor-oriented to more learner-centered teaching philosophies. Further, we demonstrate that educators can influence the attitudes of learners toward their courses before classes even begin. Implications for entrepreneurship education theory and practice are discussed."

"Synthesis of biodiesel from chicken skin waste: an economic and environmental biofuel feedstock in Bangladesh Transesterification; Catalyst; Rubber Seed Oil One of the dominating meat supply industries, the poultry chicken sector, is facing waste management concerns worldwide. Due to high oil content containment, biofuel researchers emphasized poultry waste as abundant, cheap, and high-quality feedstock for biodiesel production. Therefore, in the current study, an experimental investigation of biodiesel production from wasted chicken skin through the transesterification process has been performed. The chicken skin used in this study for biodiesel production can be used as the potential waste source for biodiesel production worldwide. Techno-economic, environmental, and sustainability analyses were also performed. During the synthesis, the reaction was conducted with potassium hydroxide (KOH), and the process yielded 48% biodiesel. The cost of electricity for providing electricity is estimated at US$0.575 per kWh when an auto-sized generator has been fueled by biodiesel. The environmental and substantiality analysis found that biodiesel is more suitable than conventional diesel as an environmentally friendly and sustainable fuel."

"Finding Sex Partners Through Social Media Among Men Who Have Sex with Men in Hanoi, Vietnam HIV Infection; Syphilis; HIV Testing Many men who have sex with men (MSM) in low and middle income countries search for male sexual partners via social media in part due to societal stigma and discrimination, yet little is known about the sexual risk profiles of MSM social media users. This cross-sectional study investigates the prevalence of social media use to find male sex partners in Hanoi, Vietnam and examines associations between social media use and sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, including levels of internalized, perceived and enacted stigma, high-risk sexual behaviors, and HIV testing. 205 MSM were recruited from public venues where MSM congregate as well as through snowball sampling and completed an anonymous survey. MSM who found their male sexual partners using social media in the last year were more likely to have completed a university or higher degree (aOR 2.6; 95% CI 1.2â€“5.7), experience high levels of MSM-related perceived stigma (aOR 3.0; 95% CI 1.1â€“8.0), and have more than ten lifetime male sexual partners (aOR 3.2; 95% CI 1.3â€“7.6) compared to those who did not use social media. A niche for social media-based interventions integrating health and stigma-reduction strategies exists in HIV prevention programs for MSM."
"Information systems development as value co-creation Product-service Systems; Service Economy; Value Co-Creation In this research, we investigate information systems development (ISD) as value co-creation and how different actors perform co-creation as an ISD approach. For this purpose, we present a case study of an ISD project that developed a digital game on the topic of climate change in a not-for-profit, intergovernmental context. The project had limited resources. It involved a number of youth and used a social media platform. We apply a taxonomic framework for value co-creation that we derived from a taxonomy of Web-based co-creation. The taxonomy had originally been developed for a commercial context and researchers have not empirically validated it before. Our study shows that the taxonomic framework explains the project as value co-creation especially with regard to co-creatorsâ€™ motivation and the types of value they created. We further discuss our findings in reference to information systems (IS) literature on service innovation. This literature contributes to additionally explaining what value co-creation is and how one can perform it as an instance of ISD practice. Against this background, we offer some propositions for how future ISD research could benefit from adopting a value co-creation perspective. Although we derived our findings from a specific project in a particular setting, we argue that they can be used to 1) prepare any co-creation project, 2) cope with co-creation during the development process by explaining co-creation as an approach to ISD, and 3) reflect and derive lessons learnt. While researchers need to further empirically validate these claims, we develop insight into value co-creation in ISD with respect to participatory approaches to ISD beyond conventional environments, roles, and participant and contributor types."

"Carbon-efficient closed-loop supply chain network: an integrated modeling approach under uncertainty Closed-Loop Supply Chain; Remanufacturing; Reverse Logistics Inspired by a circular economy paradigm, an evolving momentum of policies and legislations aims to close the loop of product lifecycles through improved level of recycling, remanufacturing, and reuse, with the objective of adding value to the economy while not endangering the environment. However, the trade-off between the environmental and economic sustainability of designing business processes is inevitable. To address this trade-off in the supply chain context, competing objectives regarding both cost minimization and reduction in carbon emission should be simultaneously considered and integrated into a comprehensive model. This complexity is however elevated when uncertainty of demand is taken into consideration. In this study, the design of a closed-loop supply chain is investigated where competing objectives of cost and sustainability of supply chain operations are evaluated under demand uncertainty. Augmented Weighted Tchebycheff (AWT) and Îµ-constraint methods are employed to address the multi-objectivity of the problem while a robust optimization approach is applied to deal with the demand uncertainty. The results confirm that the proposed approach provides efficient solutions for designing a green closed-loop supply chain network."

"Key preferences of tourists during COVID-19 pandemic in luxury hotels: Evidence from qualitative data Social Media; Online Reviews; Brand Community There is a decline in revenue and occupancy rates in the hotels during the pandemic. For the sustainable and long-term recovery of the hotel industry, the guests need to be analyzed for their stay preferences. This study attempts to find the preferred attributes of the travelers visiting the Indian luxury hotels during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research investigated the post-visit experiences from the online reviews published by tourists on TripAdvisor.com. Thematic salience valence analysis and lexical salience valence analysis was used to identify the vital attributes of the hotel industry. The study revealed staff, location, food, hygiene, and rooms as the preferred hotel attributes, in which the coastal locations were highly considered for location based marketing of luxury hotels, and non-compliance of COVID-19 standards and complaints for upgradations in the rooms were the non-recommenders for the luxury hotels. The dashboard-based salience valence zone analysis was used to provide suggestions to the hotel authorities by revealing the significant and critical hotel attributes simultaneously for prompt handling of the issues during the COVID-19 pandemic."

"Sustainable desalination by permeate gap membrane distillation technology Distillation; Direct Contact; Membrane Membrane distillation (MD) as a thermally driven process with moderate operating temperatures is a known effective technology for saltwater desalination. In this chapter, the permeate gap membrane distillation (PGMD) configuration, as a novel sustainable MD design having internal heat recovery characteristics, is introduced and numerical modeling of the heat and mass transfer phenomena in this configuration is studied. To investigate the efficiency of the PGMD system, the results of two experimental projects are described one a laboratory-scale flat PGMD rig, which was developed at RMIT University, and the other, for commercial-scale PGMD modules, which was developed by the Franhaufer Institute. Moreover, in this chapter, a literature survey is included based on recent case studies involving MD integrated with different sources of solar energy and those driven by waste heat. The chapter is completed by a general techno-economic feasibility study of PGMD systems."

"Psychological distress and homeless duration* Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease We examine whether psychological distress levels vary with homeless and housed duration. We do this using longitudinal data from a national survey of persons facing housing insecurity that, unlike prior studies, is not restricted to those who are currently homeless (or to particular subsets of the homeless), but instead follows a nationally representative sample of Australians experiencing housing insecurity. This allows us to use methods that isolate the effects of changes in time spent homeless and time spent housed on psychological distress holding constant all unobserved person-specific effects that are time invariant. We find that the relationship between psychological distress and homelessness varies by gender and by type of homelessness. Males recently experiencing literal homelessness (i.e. sleeping rough or in crisis accommodation) exhibit the highest levels of distress, but consistent with the adaptation hypothesis, distress levels decline as homeless duration increases. This pattern is not seen when examining a broader notion of homelessness for males. Likewise, there is no clear pattern with regard to homeless duration for females."

"Facile route of fabricating long-term microbicidal silver nanoparticle clusters against shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Candida auris Silver Nanoparticles; Green Synthesis; Biofabrication Microbial contamination remains a significant issue for many industrial, commercial, and medical applications. For instance, microbial surface contamination is detrimental to numerous aspects of food production, infection transfer, and even marine applications. As such, intense scientific interest has focused on improving the antimicrobial properties of surface coatings via both chemical and physical routes. However, there is a lack of synthetic coatings that possess long-term microbiocidal performance. In this study, silver nanoparticle cluster coatings were developed on copper surfaces via an ion-exchange and reduction reaction, followed by a silanization step. The durability of the microbiocidal activity for these develped surfaces was tested against pathogenic bacterial and fungal species, specifically Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Candida auris, over periods of 1-and 7-days. It was observed that more than 90% of E. coli and C. auris were found to be non-viable following the extended exposure times. This facile material fabrication presents as a new surface design for the production of durable microbicidal coatings which can be applied to numerous applications."

"Regional Tasmania Walkability The Australian Urban Observatory (AUO) is a digital portal developed at RMIT University measuring and
mapping liveability across Australia’s 21 largest cities at Local Government Area (LGA) level and down to
suburbs and local neighbourhood.

Walkability for transport is calculated based on three key factors: land use mix and services of daily
living (something to walk to); street connectivity (a way to get there); and dwelling density (higher
population densities are associated with increased populations needed to supply services and different
land uses) (Giles-Corti et al., 2014). These factors influence how people move around their local
neighbourhoods to complete everyday activities and the importance of access to supermarkets,
convenience stores, petrol stations, newsagents and public transport stops in community design.
Extensive research literature has consistently shown that local neighbourhood design is an important
influence of physical activity, health outcomes, social connectedness and sustainability (Saelens et al.,
2003).

The AUO currently includes five separate walkability indicators: average distance to closest activity centre,
average dwelling density per hectare, average street connectivity per square kilometre, average number
of daily living destinations present (0-3) within 1600m, and walkability for transport index. An example of
suburb level differences of the average street connectivity per square kilometre is provided in Figure 1
overleaf.

The AUO has been approached by the University of Tasmania (UTAS) School of Health Sciences to
analyse school walkability for primary and secondary schools, and their spatial correlation to food outlets

"Recent Advances in the Theory and Application of Nanofiltration: a Review Nanofiltration Membranes; Thin Film Composite Membranes; Membrane Water is the material basis for living organisms and one of the primary resources to maintain the sustainable development of the earthâ€™s ecological environment. As a water purification method, nanofiltration (NF) separation technology has been widely considered by researchers in recent years. However, most of the studies on NF in the literature focus on membrane modification, and there are only a few reviews available. In this paper, the latest research progress of NF is reviewed, and the processes of NF membrane preparation using phase inversion, layer by layer, and interfacial polymerization are described. Polymer materials used for NF membrane preparation are reviewed and the main types of nanofillers to generate thin film nanocomposite membranes, including metal organic frameworks, boron nitride, Ti3C2TX, graphene oxide, SiO2, and iron oxide are discussed. Membrane fouling is inevitable during NF operation and this paper analyzes the mechanisms of fouling and summarizes key pretreatment and cleaning methods required to remediate the long-term effects of cake layer formation. The steric hindrance effect, Donnan effect, and dielectric exclusion are analyzed, and some common characterization methods are summarized. The practical applications of NF are briefly introduced including groundwater, pharmaceutical wastewater, and textile wastewater treatment. Finally, the shortcomings and prospects of the existing research progress are put forward."
"Chemometrics for environmental monitoring: A review Measurement Uncertainty; Metal Ore Mining; Samplers Environmental monitoring is necessary to ensure the overall health and conservation of an ecosystem. However, ecosystems (e.g. air, water, soil), are complex, involving numerous processes (both native and external), inputs, contaminants, and living organisms. As such, monitoring an environmental system is not a trivial task. The data obtained from natural systems is often multifaceted and convoluted, as a multitude of inputs can be intertwined within the matrix of the information obtained as part of a study. This means that trends and important results can be easily overlooked by conventional and single dimensional data analysis protocols. Recently, chemometric methods have emerged as a powerful method for maximizing the details contained within a chemical data set. Specifically, chemometrics refers to the use of mathematical and statistical analysis methods to evaluate chemical data, beyond univariant analysis. This type of analysis can provide a quantitative description of environmental measurements, while also having the capacity to reveal previously overlooked trends in data sets. Applying chemometrics to environmental data allows us to identify and describe the inter-relationship of environmental drivers, sources of contamination, and their potential impact upon the environment. This review aims to provide a detailed understanding of chemometric techniques, how they are currently used in environmental monitoring, and how these techniques can be used to improve current practices. An enhanced ability to monitor environmental conditions and to predict trends would be greatly beneficial to government and research agencies in their ability to develop environmental policies and analytical procedures."

"Helpful or harmful? Exploring the impact of social media usage on intimate relationships Social Networking Sites; Social Media; Instagram Internet access in Australia is increasing with the most popular online activity reported by Australians being social media use. The literature is divided as to whether social media use is helpful or harmful to intimate relationships. Recent research from an Australian family counselling provider indicates that social media use is resulting in negative intimate relationship outcomes, echoing recent American research findings. However, other researchers note that social media use can have positive outcomes for intimate relationships and individuals. These different findings prompted this research which focuses on the impact of social media usage on intimate relationships using Facebook as a case study. A survey of 518 Australians examining Facebook usage, relationship satisfaction and household income was undertaken. The results suggest that relationship satisfaction varies based on types of social media usage when controlled for household income. For most respondents, social media usage did not have a negative impact on their relationship. However, results indicated that where their partner was a 'friend' on social media, they were less likely to report concerns relating to social media usage impacting their relationship. It was also found that those living alone or with children on low incomes were more likely to be dissatisfied with their relationships and rely on social media to connect with others. Finally, four types of Facebook usage were identified and mapped against intensity of usage and relationship satisfaction, indicating that the way in which social media is used impacts relationship satisfaction. These findings indicate that social media use is helpful for some intimate relationships and harmful for others based on individual usage and their interaction with their partner via the platform."
"Performance of ceramic ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes in treating car wash wastewater for reuse Greywater; Laundries; Waste Water Reusing treated effluents in industries is a great option to conserve freshwater resources. For example, car wash centres all over Australia are estimated to use 17.5 billion litres of water and discharge it as wastewater and spend $75 million a year for both purchasing fresh water and for treating and/or discharging the wastewater. Therefore, it is important to develop simple but reliable systems that can help to treat and reuse car wash wastewater. Significant savings could also be associated with the implementation of such systems. This study evaluates the performance of granular and membrane filtration systems with coagulation/flocculation and sedimentation in treating car wash wastewater for the purpose of reuse. Overall, 99.9% of turbidity, 100% of suspended solids and 96% of COD were removed from the car wash wastewater after treating by coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, sand filtration, ceramic ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis and the treated water meets the standards required for class A recycled water in Australia and standards imposed in Belgium and China. The treated water can be reused. However, optimisation is required to reduce the sludge produced by this system."
"R2P and Counter-Terrorism: Where Sovereignties Collide Humanitarian Intervention; First International; Ethnic Cleansing States play the lead role in implementing the norms of the international system. They interpret norms through the lens of their sovereignty, refining and revising them until they are suitable to local interests and context. The complex nature of sovereignty and its diverse manifestations across states means that norms will be interpreted and implemented in different ways. This article argues that R2P and counter-Terrorism are complex norm regimes which are susceptible to modification as they are interpreted through diverse conceptions of state sovereignty. Using the cases of China's response to the Uyghurs and Sri Lanka's response to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, this article shows that the malleable prescriptive norms of R2P and counter-Terrorism can be reinterpreted by states in ways contingent on their sovereignty that deeply impact, and may even violate, the original intent of the norm.

"Dwelling justice: locating settler relations in research and activism on stolen land Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness There is a general consensus now in Australia that we are in the grip of a severe housing crisis. The characteristics of spiralling housing costs and deepening precarity are unfolding in a context of the systematic managed decline of public housing as a critical social infrastructure, such that the capacity to make and find â€˜homeâ€™ is thinning every day. Yet in a settler-colony, such as Australia, the struggle against housing injustice is set inside an already violent relationship of un-homing that creates the very conditions for others to make home. Reckoning with this monstrous dilemma, of the politics of dwelling justice on stolen land, is the focus of this essay, which springs from our own experience and failure to fully comprehend the ways that our housing research and activism works to reinforce settler colonial logics of dwelling on stolen land."

"Relationships between geomorphological features and groundwater geochemistry in the upper and middle basin of Las Peñas stream, Pampean Mountains, Córdoba. Argentina Groundwater Samples; Water Quality; Piper Las PeÃ±as stream basin, located in the Pampean Mountains of Cordoba (Argentina), has specific groundwater features which are of great interest for the local socioeconomic activities. The objective of this work is to define the geomorphological characteristics of the basin and interpret their influence on hydrogeological processes, emphasizing hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemical aspects. Groundwater flow in the unconfined aquifer has developed in both sediments and fractured rocks. The groundwater is fresh with electrical conductivities between 586 ÂµS/cm and 2000 ÂµS/cm, although there are localized samples in the piedmont of brackish type (up to 3900 ÂµS/cm). Sampled groundwaters are almost entirely of calcium and sodium bicarbonate geochemical type, with local occurrence of mixed type (sodium-calcium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate-sulfate) waters. Taking into account geomorphological and lithological features, both groundwater flow and hydrochemical aspects are linked with the main geomorphological environments: a relict paleosurface with a sedimentary cover, a rocky dissected paleosurface with filled valleys and the sedimentary piedmont. It was interpreted that groundwater geochemistry is mainly linked to input from precipitation and weathering of silicates. Dissolution of carbonates and cation exchange processes contribute to the observed groundwater chemistry especially in the relict paleosurface and piedmont."

"Circular cities: exploring local government strategies to facilitate a circular economy Industrial Symbiosis; Sustainable Development; Circular Economy Cities are growing rapidly, and the systems of production and consumption that support this growth are contributing to the depletion of natural resources and pollution of the environment. The circular economy model offers an alternative to the predominant take-make-dispose economic system. Local municipalities are seen to have the capacity to encourage sustainable development of the built environment. This paper aims to explore the role of strategic planning in facilitating a circular economy in urban settings. In particular, this research asks: How are local governments facilitating circular economy initiatives through strategic planning? What are the opportunities and barriers when applying circular economy principles through local strategic planning? The research approach used for this paper is a comparative case study of two international municipalities: the City of Melbourne, Australia and the City of MalmÃ¶, Sweden. Current strategic planning practice was examined with a focus on circular economy themes. The findings reveal that strategic urban planning can translate circular economy objectives into actions within specific urban areas, although barriers still exist to fully integrating the circular economy model."

"Anti- HIV-1 activity of lactic acid in human cervicovaginal fluid Vagina Flora; Gardnerella Vaginalis; Atopobium Vaginae Women of reproductive age with a Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota have a reduced risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV and a vaginal pH of ~4 due to the presence of ~1% (wt/vol) lactic acid. While lactic acid has potent HIV virucidal activity in vitro, whether lactic acid present in the vaginal lumen inactivates HIV has not been investigated. Here we evaluated the anti-HIV-1 activity of native, minimally diluted cervicovaginal fluid obtained from women of reproductive age (n = 20) with vaginal microbiota dominated by Lactobacillus spp. Inhibition of HIVBa-L was significantly associated with the protonated form of lactic acid in cervicovaginal fluid. The HIVBa-L inhibitory activity observed in the < 3-kDa acidic filtrate was similar to that of the corresponding untreated native cervicovaginal fluid as well as that of clarified neat cervicovaginal fluid subjected to protease digestion. These ex vivo studies indicate that protonated lactic acid is a major anti-HIV-1 metabolite present in acidic cervicovaginal fluid, suggesting a potential role in reducing HIV transmission by inactivating virus introduced or shed into the cervicovaginal lumen."

"A Proposal for Applying Belief, Desire, and Intent Agents toward Automotive Vehicle Energy Management Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles; Energy Conservation; Energy Management The automotive industry is facing a multifaceted problem of supervisory energy management, computational power, and digitalization. In response, this article proposes the use of agents utilizing the belief, desire, and intent (BDI) framework as a means to flexibly create online vehicle management systems (VMSs). Under such proposal, a community of agents form a vehicle configuration. Each agent represents a vehicle subsystem and contains knowledge specific to its respective hardware. With this knowledge and partial observation over its operating environment, each agent uses the BDI framework to deliberate over its actions. An interaction protocol, which implements a distributed constraint satisfaction problem (DCSP) algorithm, is used between the agents to create sensible emergent behavior of the vehicle. This interaction protocol allows independently reasoning components to produce emergent behavior that is flexible, robust, verifiable, and explainable. In addition, an internal structure on top of the BDI framework is specified which allows an agent to conduct long-term and short-term deliberation asynchronously. A simple, parallel hybrid electric vehicle model is used to demonstrate the application of BDI agents. The agents are tested over the vehicle's operating envelope to show how independent deliberation and the interaction protocol results in expected behavior and undesirable interactions are avoided. By using agents as modular components, features like dynamic vehicle configurations and persistent intentions are achieved. This article lays the foundation for further studies in the field of applying agents to automotive vehicle control."

"Do the natural chemical compounds interact with the same targets of current pharmacotherapy for weight management?-A review Weight Loss; Phentermine; Anti-Obesity Agents Background: Obesity has become a worldwide health concern. Pharmacotherapies are now being introduced because lifestyle modifications alone are insufficient for weight management. The treatment outcomes of current approved anti-obesity agents are not satisfying due to drug-related intolerances. And so natural therapies including herbal medicines are popular alternatives for weight reduction; however, there are limited studies about their mechanism of actions. Methods: Five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Proquest) were searched to investigate the targets and safety profiles of the current and past anti-obesity drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as well as the commonly used off-label agents. The targets for weight-loss natural products and their principle bioactive components have also been searched. Only articles in English were included. Results: The targets for current anti-obesity single agents include pancreatic lipase, Glucagon Like Peptide-1(GLP-1) receptor, and serotonin 2C (5-HT 2C ) receptor. Potential targets such as amylin, pancreatic alpha amylase, leptin receptor, melanocortin receptor 4 receptor (MC4R), Peroxisome Proliferator- Activated Receptors gamma (PPAR Î³), endocannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor and Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP)-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) were discussed in various studies. Natural compounds have been found to interact with targets like pancreatic lipase, pancreatic alpha amylase, AMPK and PPAR Î³ to achieve weight reduction. Conclusion: Current pharmacotherapies and natural chemical compounds do act on same targets. Further investigations on the interactions between herbal compounds and the above targets are essential for the development of novel weight-loss therapies."

"Sustainable polymers from recycled waste plastics and their virgin counterparts as bitumen modifiers: A comprehensive review Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens The failure of bituminous pavements takes place due to heavy traffic loads and weatherrelated conditions, such as moisture, temperature, and UV radiation. To overcome or minimize such failures, a great effort has been put in recent years to enhance the material properties of bitumen, ultimately improving field performance and increasing the pavement service life. Polymer modification is considered one of the most suitable and by far the most popular approach. Elastomers, chemically functionalised thermoplastics and plastomers * (* Note: Notwithstanding the fact that in Polymer Science the word â€˜plastomerâ€™ indicates a polymer with the simultaneous behaviour of an elastomer and plastics (thermoplastics), this paper uses the term â€˜plastomerâ€™ to indicate a thermoplastic polymer as it is more commonly found in Civil and Pavement Engineering.) are the most commonly used polymers for bitumen modification. Plastomers provide several advantages and are commonly acknowledged to improve high-temperature stiffness, although some of them are more prone to phase separation and consequent storage instability. Nowadays, due to the recent push for recycling, many road authorities are looking at the use of recycled plastics in roads. Hence, some of the available plastomers-in pellet, flakes, or powder form-are coming from materials recycling facilities rather than chemical companies. This review article describes the details of using plastomers as bitumen modifiers-with a specific focus on recycled plastics-and how these can potentially be used to enhance bitumen performance and the road durability. Chemical modifiers for improving the compatibility between plastomers and bitumen are also addressed in this review. Plastomers, either individual or in combination of two or three polymers, are found to offer great stiffness at high temperature. Different polymers including HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE, MDPE, PP, PS, PET, EMA, and EVA have been successfully employed for bitumen modification. However, each of them has its own merit and demerit as thoroughly discussed in the paper. The recent push in using recycled materials in roads has brought new light to the use of virgin and recycled plastomers for bitumen modification as a low-cost and somehow environmental beneficial solution for roads and pavements."
"Recent advances in the construction of sustainable asphalt roads with recycled plastic Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens Although various polyolefins have intermittently been used for making roads since the 1980s, the recycling of plastic waste into roads raises new challenges related to the production, performance and durability of plastic-modified asphalt. This review critically discusses the challenges of incorporating recycled plastics into bitumen/asphalt in terms of plastic selection, chemical compatibility, long-term performance and potential contributions to fuming, microplastic pollution and contaminant leaching. Recent advances in the field are also presented and recommendations for future work to address current research and industrial gaps are suggested. Challenges related to the construction of plastic roads include the wide variability in the plastic composition and its properties after recycling, which not only affect the successful incorporation of plastic in bitumen but also impact the mechanical properties and environmental impact of the roads. The lack of representative testing procedures prevents an accurate understanding of the short- and long-term performance of plastic roads in real conditions and the contribution of plastic roads to fuming and microplastic release remains unclear. However, promising laboratory-based procedures have been developed to benchmark the release of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds, as well as microplastics, from recycled plastic-modified asphalt against conventional polymer-modified asphalts. Standards are still required to facilitate bitumen/asphalt modification by recycled plastics, meet the needs of bitumen/asphalt manufacturers and convince local authorities to foster the construction of plastic roads if proven to be a sustainable practice.

"The bee-benders hybrid algorithm with application to transmission expansion planning Electric Power Transmission Networks; Optimal Power Flow; Power System This paper introduces a novel hybrid optimisation algorithm that combines elements of both metaheuristic search and integer programming. This new matheuristic combines elements of Benders decomposition and the Bees Algorithm, to create the Bee-Benders Hybrid Algorithm (BBHA) which retains many of the advantages of both methods. Specifically, it is designed to be easily parallelisable, to produce good solutions quickly while still retaining a guarantee of optimality when run for a sufficiently long time. The algorithm is tested using a transmission network expansion and energy storage planning model, a challenging and very large scale mixed integer linear programming problem. The BBHA is shown to be a highly effective hybrid matheuristic algorithm for this challenging combinatorial optimisation problem that performs at least as well as either Benders decomposition or the Bees Algorithm on their own, and significantly improves upon the individual approaches in many instances. While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness on an electricity network planning problem, the algorithm could be readily applied to any mixed integer linear program, and is expected to work particularly well whenever this has a structure that is amenable to Benders decomposition."

"Roasted Wheat Germ: A Natural Plant Product in Development of Nutritious Milk Pudding; Physicochemical and Nutritional Properties Fatty Acid; Rancidity; Tocopherols Wheat germ has been recognized as an economical source of high-quality plant proteins and bioactive compounds for food fortification. Thus, it can be used for valorization of food products as a feasible strategy to enhance the nutritional quality and reduce wheat milling waste. In this research roasted wheat germ (RG) was added in formulation of egg-free milk pudding to enhance its nutritional value and the effects of RG particle size (125, 210 and 354 Âµm) and quantity (0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10%) on the quality, nutritional and sensory properties of the resulting pudding were investigated. Reducing the particle size of RG significantly altered its chemical composition but had no significant effect on its antioxidant activity. Increasing the level of RG in the pudding, reduced pH and syneresis while increased dry matter content, hardness, cohesiveness and gumminess of the product. The quantity of RG had more effects on physicochemical properties of the puddings than changing the particle size. Based on the sensory evaluation results, the most acceptable sample was obtained by addition of 7.5% RG with a particle size of 125 Âµm."

"Legal risk and information spillover through private lender reports Bank Lending Channel; Loans; Credit Rationing We investigate the effect of legal risk on private information spillover from syndicated loan borrowers to equity markets. We find evidence that is consistent with leakage of information provided to institutional investors in monthly private reports. We expect that insiders avoid the adverse consequences of noise trading by timing trades closely before public announcements. Consistent with this expectation, during a period of low legal risk, we observe abnormal stock returns just before public earnings releases. When legal risk increases, the information leakage decreases. We also find that reputational risk mitigates insider trading after private information releases."

"Measuring Neighbourhood Walking Access for Older Adults Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Older adults are an important part of the worldâ€™s population. Many researchers have worked on walking as a mode of transport and measuring walking access. However, considering older adults (aged 65 and over) walk time, older population, and older pedestriansâ€™ safety to measure walking accessibility has not been widely discussed. This study proposes two Walking Accessibility Index (OWAI1 and OWAI2) to measure walking access levels for older adults around the neighbourhoods. The index considers the older travelersâ€™ walk time to reach various destinations (e.g., shopping, healthcare, education, and recreation services), land use mix, pedestrian crash datasets, street connectivity and the older population. Among these two proposed indices, OWAI1 statistically performs better. The transport and urban planners can use the newly developed OWAI1 for future planning and policy implementations. The index may be applied to measure disabled commutersâ€™ walking access levels as considerable walking speed is lower. Besides, the proposed index is also appropriate for other adults by using the corresponding variables for that particular age group. Metropolitan Melbourne is used in this paper as the case study to measure older adultsâ€™ walking accessibility. This paper outlines that the older adultsâ€™ walking access level is very low for most Melbourne areas, negatively impacting their travel behavior."

"An investigation into per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in nineteen Australian wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Quantifying the emissions of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from Australian wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is of high importance due to potential impacts on receiving aquatic ecosystems. The new Australian PFAS National Environmental Management Plan recommends 0.23 ng Lâˆ’1 of PFOS as the guideline value for 99% species protection for aquatic systems. In this study, 21 PFAS from four classes were measured in WWTP solid and aqueous samples from 19 Australian WWTPs. The mean âˆ‘21PFAS was 110 ng Lâˆ’1 (median: 80 ng Lâˆ’1; range: 9.3â€“520 ng Lâˆ’1) in aqueous samples and 34 ng gâˆ’1 dw (median: 12 ng gâˆ’1 dw; range: 2.0â€“130 ng gâˆ’1 dw) in WWTP solids. Similar to WWTPs worldwide, perfluorocarboxylic acids were generally higher in effluent, compared to influent. Partitioning to solids within WWTPs increased with increasing fluoroalkyl chain length from 0.05 to 1.22 log units. Many PFAS were highly correlated, and PCA analysis showed strong associations between two groups: odd chained PFCAs, PFHxA and PFSAs; and 6:2 FTS with daily inflow volume and the proportion of trade waste accepted by WWTPs (as % of typical dry inflow). The compounds PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA increased significantly between influent and final effluent. The compounds 6:2 FTS and 8:2 FTS were quantified and Fâ€“53B detected and reported in Australian WWTP matrices. The compound 6:2 FTS was an important contributor to PFAS emissions in the studied Australian WWTPs, supporting the need for future research on its sources (including precursor degradation), environmental fate and impact in Australian aquatic environments receiving WWTP effluent."
"How to navigate the evolving world of clinical placement: an Australian university collaboration to support clinical supervision Preceptorship; Nursing Students; Mentor Clinical placement is an integral part of medical radiation science student learning and development. Clinical placement provides opportunity for students to apply their theoretical knowledge and enable students to prepare for their future professional practice. Clinical supervisors have a significant role in this process to facilitate student learning on clinical placement. However, clinical supervisors often have little formal training to supervising students on placement and will default to their own previous learning experience. There is a need to provide an educational perspective from tertiary education partners to assist medical radiation practitioners in their role of supervising students. This paper is a collaboration between Australian Nuclear Medicine University partners with the aim to support and educate nuclear medicine technologists, and indeed all medical radiation practitioners to competently fulfil their role regarding student supervision and assessment."

"Effect of superplasticizer type and dosage on fluidity and strength behavior of cemented tailings backfill with different solid contents Backfill; Tailings; Ointment This paper presents the coupled effect of solid content and superplasticizer type and dosage on the fluidity and strength properties of cemented tailings backfills (CTB). A total of three different superplasticizers (namely, naphthalene, ether-based and ester-based polycarboxylate) were used at a ratio varying from 0% to 0.5% by mass of CTB. The CTB mixes were proportioned with a solid content of 65%, 66%, 68% and 70%. The unconfined compressive strength tests were performed on CTB samples after 3, 7 and 28 days of curing period. The obtained results show that the effect of superplasticizer on CTB performance depends on type and dosage of the superplasticizer used as well as solid content. The naphthalene-based polycarboxylate admixtures demonstrate the best improvement on fluidity behavior of fresh CTB mixture. For a given superplasticizer type, increases in the dosage of superplasticizer and decreases in the solid content lead to better workability of CTB samples. When increasing solid content, fresh CTB with high superplasticizer dosage performs a relatively low rate of decrease in the workability. A relatively high solid content and superplasticizer dosage have greatly contributed to improved mechanical strengths, especially at 28-day curing age, mainly due to a major reduction in water-to-cement ratio and porosity."

"Service quality monitoring in confined spaces through mining Twitter data Event Detection; Twitter; Social Networking Promoting public transport depends on adapting effective tools for concurrent monitoring of perceived service quality. Social media feeds, in general, provide an opportunity to ubiquitously look for service quality events, but when applied to confined geographic area such as a transport node, the sparsity of concurrent social media data leads to two major challenges. Both the limited number of social media messagesâ€”leading to biased machine-learningâ€”and the capturing of bursty events in the study period considerably reduce the effectiveness of general event detection methods. In contrast to previous work and to face these challenges, this paper presents a hybrid solution based on a novel finetuned BERT language model and aspect-based sentiment analysis. BERT enables extracting aspects from a limited context, where traditional methods such as topic modeling and word embedding fail. Moreover, leveraging aspect-based sentiment analysis improves the sensitivity of event detection. Finally, the efficacy of event detection is further improved by proposing a statistical approach to combine frequency-based and sentiment-based solutions. Experiments on a real-world case study demonstrate that the proposed solution improves the effectiveness of event detection compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

"Potential fluoride exposure from selected food crops grown in high fluoride soils in the Makueni County, south-eastern Kenya Fluorides; Pollution; Euphausia Superba Makueni County, located in south-eastern Kenya, faces challenges such as limited potable water and restricted food supplies as the result of semi-aridity. High fluoride (F) concentrations have been reported in drinking water with resultant dental fluorosis affecting the local population. To determine the potential F exposure through the consumption of food crops grown in the area, F concentration was assessed in the main five locally grown and consumed crops. Additionally, the water-soluble F fraction was determined from 30 soil samples with mineralogical determination of 20 samples. Mean F concentration in the food crops was in the order; 700, 288, 71.2, 36.6, and 29 mg/kg in kale, cowpeas leaves, green grams, cowpeas (legume portion), and maize, respectively. The F concentration in farm soils ranged from 0 to 3.47 mg/kg (mean of 0.87 mg/kg) and showed a significant strong positive correlation (p = 0.03, r = 0.89) with F values in the crops. Apatite, muscovite, and biotite were identified as the F-rich minerals present. While considering two hypothetical F absorption fractions (75 and 100%), the estimated average daily dose (EADD) of F from consuming the crops ranged between 0.004 and 65.17 mg/kg/day where the highest values were from the vegetables. Most of these values were higher than the F reference dose (RfD) of 0.06 mg/kg. The estimated EADD values of several hypothetical meals prepared from the analyzed crops revealed that steamed kale and maize porridge pose the highest health risk of F associated diseases to the local population, whereas boiled cowpeas pose no health risk. Children, due to their higher daily energy requirement and low body weight, were the most vulnerable group at risk of high daily F intake relative to the RfD. These results suggest that consumption of the analyzed food crops in Makueni County may significantly contribute to F related diseases in the local population. This creates a food security issue for the area because of the potential health risks associated with these crops which are highly relied upon in the semi-arid area with a limited selection of food crops available and viable to grow."
"Trust, conversations and the ‘middle space’: A qualitative exploration of the experiences of physiotherapists with clients with suicidal thoughts and behaviours Physiotherapy; Musculoskeletal Pain; Chiropractic In Australia, physiotherapists are registered healthcare practitioners who possess the knowledge and skills to care for clients with poor physical health as a result of musculoskeletal, neurological, and respiratory conditions. Although physiotherapists are not considered a primary profession in the Australian mental health workforce, the association between suicide and poor physical health suggests that they may encounter clients with suicidal thoughts and behaviours. We used a qualitative approach inspired by phenomenology to explore the experiences of nine physiotherapists who encountered clients with suicidal thoughts and behaviours. We used a combination of focus groups and in-depth interviews to collect this data. The data were analysed inductively using framework analysis. The main themes identified in the data were: i) the importance of trust, ii) the mechanism of conversation, and iii) theâ€™middle spaceâ€™. The middle space refers to the experience of working with clients at risk of low or medium risk of suicide. A trusting practitioner-client relationship was reported to be essential in facilitating the disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Physiotherapists also reported that less structured subjective assessments encourage clients to talk more openly, which in turn facilitates the disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Once the disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviours occurred, physiotherapists reported a lack of confidence regarding role clarity and issues associated with this. Difficulties were most evident during encounters with clients with low to medium suicide risk due to a lack of confidence in the accuracy of assessment of these clients. The findings suggest that physiotherapists are well placed to detect and/or receive disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviours, as well as the need for physiotherapists to be trained in how to support clients who disclose suicidal thoughts and behaviours."

"Superimposed microplastic pollution in a coastal metropolis Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter The mitigation of microplastic pollution in the environment calls for a better understanding of the sources and transportation, especially from land sources to the open ocean. We conducted a large-scale investigation of microplastic pollution across the Greater Melbourne Area and the Western Port area, Australia, spanning gradients of land-use from un-developed catchments in conservation areas to more heavily-developed areas. Microplastics were detected in 94% of water samples and 96% of sediment samples, with abundances ranging from 0.06 to 2.5 items/L in water and 0.9 to 298.1 items/kg in sediment. The variation of microplastic abundance in sediments was closely related to that of the overlying waters. Fiber was the most abundant (89.1% and 68.6% of microplastics in water and sediment respectively), and polyester was the dominant polymer in water and sediment. The size of more than 40% of all total microplastics observed was less than 1 mm. Both light and dense polymers of different shapes were more abundant in sediments than those in water, indicating that there is microplastic accumulation in sediments. The abundance of microplastics was higher near coastal cities than at less densely-populated inland areas. A spatial analysis of the data suggests that the abundance of microplastics increases downstream in rivers and accumulates in estuaries and the lentic reaches of these rivers. Correlation and redundancy analysis were used to explore the associations between microplastic pollution and different land-use types. More microplastics and polymer types were found at areas with large amounts of commercial, industrial and transport activities. Microplastic abundances were also correlated with mean particle size. Microplastic hotspots within a coastal metropolis might be caused by a combination of natural accumulation via hydrological dynamics and contribution from increasing anthropogenic influences. Our results strongly suggest that coastal metropolis superimposed on increasing microplastic levels in waterbodies from inland areas to the estuaries and open oceans. A coastal metropolis first receives microplastic inputs from upstream then magnifies its abundance and transportation via urban activities."

"Fijian infrastructural citizenship: spaces of electricity sharing and informal power grids in an informal settlement Informality; Slums; Governance Infrastructure has historically been absent in informal settlements in Oceania. Oceanic governments have deliberately withheld infrastructure to these settlements denying them essential resources, human rights, and ways of life. Current reforms in urban policy seek to rectify this record by promising more inclusive infrastructures. In this article, I investigate the effect a promised electricity infrastructure had in an informal settlement in Suva, Fiji. Prior to development, residents created their own infrastructures that equitably shared electricity in spaces of electricity sharing. The initiation of infrastructural works destroyed this local infrastructure embedded in local social relations. While residents waited for this promised infrastructure to be constructed, they erected informal power grids that mimicked the exclusive and commoditised provision of electricity of the planned infrastructure. I argue that the promise of infrastructural development in informal settlements in Oceania is reshaping previously inclusive forms infrastructural citizenship in favour of more exclusive infrastructural relationships."

"Does diffusivity affect the spatial variance of reverberation time? Reverberation Chambers; Damping; Absorptivity Annex A of the 2017 draft revision of ISO 354:2003 contains a qualification test of the diffusivity of the reverberant sound field based on the spatial variance of the reverberation time. This was initially based on experimental measurements that showed that the spatial variance of reverberation time decreased when diffusing panels were added to the reverberation room. Davyâ€™s theory shows that the spatial variance of reverberation time is proportional to the reverberation time. Adding diffusers to the reverberation room increases the sound absorption and hence reduces the reverberation time and its spatial variance, as was experimentally observed. Because of this observation Annex A now requires the ratio of the experimental to the theoretical spatial standard deviation of reverberation time averaged over the third octave bands from 250 to 3150 Hz to be less than or equal to one. When Davy was initially comparing his theory with experimental results, he found no difference in the agreement between theory and experiment for rooms with and without diffusers and with and without a highly sound absorbing material on the floor for rooms ranging in volume from 100 to 600 cubic metres. This suggests that the qualification test of Annex A is not sensitive enough to make sure that the reverberation room decaying sound field is adequately diffuse when there is a highly sound absorbing sample on the floor. Davyâ€™s original papers combined the experimental data from the eight different room configurations. This paper examines the eight individual room configuration results separately. It shows that a room without sufficient diffusers to be able to measure the correct sound absorption coefficients at high frequencies would pass the Annex A diffusivity qualification test. Based on this result, it recommends that Annex A be removed from the 2017 draft revision of ISO 354:2003."

"A combination model based on transfer learning for waste classification Object Detection; Deep Learning; IOU The increasing amount of solid waste is becoming a significant problem that needs to be addressed urgently. The reliable and accurate classification method is a crucial step in waste disposal because different types of wastes have different disposal ways. The existing waste classification models driven by deep learning are not easy to achieve accurate results and still need to be improved due to the various architecture networks adopted. Their performance on different datasets is varied, and there is also a lack of specific large-scale datasets for training. We propose a new combination classification model based on three pretrained CNN models (VGG19, DenseNet169, and NASNetLarge) for processing the ImageNet database and achieve high classification accuracy. In our proposed model, the transfer learning model based on each pretrained model is constructed as a candidate classifier, and the optimal output of three candidate classifiers is selected as the final classification result. The experiments based on two waste image datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves 96.5% and 94% classification accuracy and outperforms several counterpart methods."
"The social life of HIV care: On the making of ‘care beyond the virus’ AIDS/HIV; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Antiretroviral Therapy Treating care as an effect of material implementations, we use qualitative interviews with people living with HIV in London, most of whom are migrants, to explore care practices linked to clinical treatment delivered as part of the â€˜cascade of HIV careâ€™. We consider how HIV care is done, and what HIV care does, drawing on assemblage theory. We ask how is care affected by the situations in which it is enacted? and what contingent forms of care does the HIV care cascade potentiate? A prime actor in the care assemblages revealed in our study is immigration, from which multiple uncertainties flow, including access to vital resources such as housing and income. Yet we also found that clinical HIV care is worked-with in practice to afford multiple forms of care. Here, viral care is translated into matters of vital concern to produce care which extends â€˜beyond the virusâ€™. Practices of care beyond the virus afford social protection, including through making-up social relations and networks, and novel modes of sociality. Friendship connections, community organisations and HIV clinics are among the key actors involved. Being attuned to how HIV care is made to matter helps generate new ways of knowing and doing care."
"Changing Police Officers’ Attitudes in Sexual Offense Cases: A 12-Month Follow-Up Study Rape; Sexual Assault; Offenders We examined whether specialist training can have an immediate and lasting impact on investigatorsâ€™ attitudes in sexual offense cases. Australian police officers participated in a 4-week training program that focused on the dynamics of sexual offending. Officers completed questionnaires before, immediately after, and 9 to 12 months following training. They were presented with scenarios involving adult and child complainants with varying levels of evidence (strong, weak, or ambiguous) and rated their confidence that the case would be approved for prosecution, the likelihood of a guilty verdict, and the level of responsibility attributed to the victim. Following training, investigators became more confident in case approvals and guilty verdicts, less likely to attribute responsibility to victims, and demonstrated better understanding of sexual offense dynamics. Ratings of victim responsibility and guilty verdicts were maintained 9 to 12 months post-training; however, confidence in case approvals decreased after working in the field. Implications for police training programs are discussed."

"Liveable for whom? Prospects of urban liveability to address health inequities Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians The aspiration of liveable cities, underpinned by the New Urban Agenda, is gaining popularity as a mechanism to enhance population health and wellbeing. However, less attention has been given to understanding how urban liveability may provide an opportunity to redress health inequities. Using an environmental justice lens, this paper investigates whether urban liveability poses an opportunity or threat to reducing health inequities and outlines a future research agenda. Selected urban liveability attributes, being: education; employment; food, alcohol, and tobacco; green space; housing; transport; and walkability, were investigated to understand how they can serve to widen or narrow inequities. Some domains showed consistent evidence, others suggested context-specific associations that made it difficult to draw general conclusions, and some showed a reverse patterning with the social gradient, but with poorer outcomes. This suggests urban liveability attributes have equigenic potential, but operate within a complex system. We conclude more disadvantaged neighbourhoods and their residents likely have additional policy and design considerations for optimising outcomes, especially as changes to the contextual environment may impact neighbourhood composition through displacement and/or pulling up effects. Future research needs to continue to explore downstream associations using longitudinal and natural experiments, and also seek to gain a deeper understanding of the urban liveability system, including interactions, feedback loops, and non-linear and linear responses. There is a need to monitor neighbourhood population changes over time to understand how liveability impacts the most vulnerable. Other areas worthy of further investigation include applying a life course approach and understanding liveability within the context of other adversities and contextual settings."
"Self-calibrating programmable photonic integrated circuits Microwave Photonics; Tunable; Phase Shifters Programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are dense assemblies of tunable elements that provide flexible reconfigurability to enable different functions to be selected; however, due to manufacturing variations and thermal gradients that affect the optical phases of the elements, it is difficult to guarantee a stable correspondence between the electrical commands to the chip, and the function that it provides. Here we demonstrate a self-calibrating programmable PIC with full control over its complex impulse response, in the presence of thermal cross-talk between phase-tuning elements. Self-calibration is achieved by: (1) incorporating an optical reference path into the PIC; (2) using the Kramersâ€“Kronig relationship to recover the phase response from amplitude measurements; and (3) applying a fast-converging self-calibration algorithm. We demonstrate dial-up signal processing functions with complex impulse responses using only 25 training iterations. This approach offers stable and accurate control of large-scale PICs, for demanding applications such as communications network reconfiguration, neuromorphic hardware accelerators and quantum computers."

"The Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture: Findings from Households in Vietnam Crops; CERES (Experiment); Climate Change Impact This paper examines farm household-level impacts of climate change by examining the relationship between climatic variables and Vietnamese agricultural output. The Ricardian technique is applied with panel data which accounts for both adaptation strategies and household characteristics. This study proposes a two-stage Hsiao model to correct for collinearity between climatic variables and individual effects. The results show that in the dry season, increases in temperatures are beneficial to all farms in the warmer southern regions, while increases in precipitation will damage only irrigated farms in the Central and South regions. The impact of higher temperature in the wet season is similar, except that it will negatively affect net revenue of irrigated farms in the long run. More rainfall in the wet season will increase net revenue in the North region only. Finally, this study combines the estimated results with future climate scenarios to predict how future changes in climate will affect farmers on aggregate."

"Sustainable criterion selection framework for green building materials – An optimisation based study of fly-ash Geopolymer concrete Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali Green materials are considered as one of the prominent elements in designing an environmentally sustainable construction project. Studies have highlighted cement replacement is a popular method of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and replacing virgin materials in concrete. These options incur cost implications through sophisticated designs and technologies. The importance of maintaining a balance between environmental and economic benefits of a green design is critical for the decision making stakeholders in a construction project. However, designers often lack the resources and tools to initiate informed decision making for the optimum selection of a green material. In order to systemize the optimising process, the current study suggests a multi-objective optimisation based decision making framework for optimising the cement replacement materials in concrete. The study aims to present a sustainable criterion optimisation framework that could well be adopted to assess the sustainability of green materials in concrete production. A case study using fly ash geopolymer concrete in Melbourne demonstrated a reduction of 3.63% to 41.57% and 23.80% to 30.25% can be achieved for GHG emissions and production cost respectively if the developed optimisation based framework is implemented. The scenario results highlighted around 3% to 8% GHG and cost increase if material is not available locally. A similar approach can be utilised to optimise the environmental and cost savings of other cement replacement materials. Further studies are encouraged on comparing environmental and cost savings of other cement replacement materials using the developed framework. The framework will be valuable for designers in making decisions on sustainable cement replacement materials."

"Leveraging smart contract in project procurement through dlt to gain sustainable competitive advantages Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things Project delivery on time, with agreed quality and assigned budget, is the desire of project-based companies. Time, quality, and cost are determinants of project success; however, organisations suffer from achieving these three success criteria at the same time. Failures in project delivery cause the loss of the competitive advantage. The recent digital technologies introduce smart contracts to supply chain (SC) operations for improving SC processes. Project procurement is the area for smart contract implementation to deliver successful projects and gain sustainable competitive advantages. The aim of this study was in explaining how smart contracts benefit project organisations through project procurement. Qualitative research design guided this research with phenomenology. Semi-structured interviews generated the data. The obtained research data were analysed with thematic, textual, and discourse analysis. Published industry reports were used to triangulate the data. This study demonstrated an integrated relationship model to answer the research question. The research findings initially identified the fact that smart contracts improve procurement efficiency through cost, time, and quality. Secondly, smart contracts build a trust-less platform where reliability is delivered and reinforced with transparency, traceability, and security. This study found that enhanced procurement efficiency and reliability meet requirements to gain sustainable competitive advantages. This study intends to contribute to industry practices and future research. The correlation of project procurement management success, smart contracts, and sustainable competitive advantages are expected to guide feature research and business practices."

"Young people and the human-car-machine-assemblage: aesthetics, erotics and other lessons for school-based health education Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work The early twentieth-century Futurist and Fascist sense of â€˜speedâ€™ as an aesthetic ideal and object of desire continues to be a pervasive and powerful influence in contemporary culture. The paper explores aspects of cultural imaginaries and discourses of the body, their relationships to the motor vehicle, and how these imaginaries play out in the health education space, specifically in a schools-based road safety programme, Fit to Drive (F2D), where the erotics and aesthetics of the human-car-machine-assemblage are made absent. In imagining the limits and possibilities of human embodiment in road safety/health education, we present encounters with the fascist psyche, with Grahamâ€“a grotesque (baroque) creature at the heart of a collaborative art project/installation, with the folds of our bodies, and the competing possibilities of the baroque.

"Radio Source Localization Using Received Signal Strength in a Multipath Environment Localization; Received Signal Strength; Wi-Fi We consider the problem of localizing a radio emitter in a wireless network using RSS measured by a set of known network nodes in a multipath environment. While the RSS of a wireless signal can be conveniently accessed, using it to estimate location is nontrivial in the presence of multipath. We propose a HMM model within a Bayesian learning framework for processing RSS data in the localization process to deal with RSS fluctuations induced by multipath interference. To address the uncertainty of emitter dynamics, a semi-Markov model is also adopted to model the duration time of the emitter sojourn in a state. We compare the performance of the HMM methods, HsMM methods and RSS fingerprinting methods via a real experiment of a two-region emitter localization problem and Monte Carlo simulations using ray-tracing software."

"LDPE and Crumb Rubber in Asphalt Several types of materials are currently being recycled in roads. Among those, the most common are Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material - e.g. old asphalt roads - crumb rubber and, more recently, waste plastic. The latter has been already available in the market since decades in the form of low-crystallinity polyolefins and other thermoplastic polymers - Austroads also has one registered plastomeric-modified bitumen product named 'A35P' in its range of polymer-modified bitumen types. However it is only since recently that the need for recycling has pushed the use of recycled plastic in asphalt mixes. The use of high percentage of LDPE and HDPE in roads is commonly limited by several drawbacks such as increased temperature and reduce workability during construction operations; most importantly, plastic-modified asphalt has been largely acknowledge as to improve asphalt performance at high service temperature where high stiffness is needed but cannot provide any tangible benefit to increase the service life of the road due to poor fatigue characteristics - not being an 'elastic' elastomer limits the ability to rapidly and continuously recover from deformations due to loads (e.g. the traffic). The use of plastomeric-modified bitumen A35P is also discouraged by recent documents from Austroads and AAPA (Australian Asphalt Pavement Association) for fatigue purposes. On the other hand, crumb rubber modification of bitumen is ascribed to provide greater elasticity - even at low service temperature - hence shifting to more ductile behaviour and improved fatigue service life. High temperature issues are still to be considered though."

"Cynicism about Change, Work Engagement, and Job Satisfaction of Public Sector Nurses Organizational Cynicism; Job Satisfaction; Emotional Stress This paper uses the job demands-resources theory to examine the consequences of changes on nursing work. Data were collected from 220 public sector nurses in Australia to test the model. We conducted a two-wave data collection process where independent variables (organisational change, workload, job control, nursing administrative stressors, cynicism about organisational change, and demographic variables) were collected in Time 1. The dependent variables (nursing work engagement and job satisfaction) were collected 6 months later. Changes to nursing work were found to cause high workload and an increase of administrative stressors that leads to an increase in nursesâ€™ change cynicism. Job control was needed to cope with the increase in workload and reduction in cynicism about change. Cynicism about organisational change was found to have a direct negative effect on nursesâ€™ engagement which in turn was found to negatively impact job satisfaction. Our contribution to theory and practice arises from the discovery that the connections between organisational change, work environment variables, and job outcomes of nurses are more complicated than previous research suggests. Theoretical and practical implications will be discussed."
"Optimizing the energy consumption in a residential building at different climate zones: Towards sustainable decision making Walls (Structural Partitions); Hot Temperature; Insulation Electricity dependent heating-cooling (H/C) system has increased rapidly to provide thermal comfort to the occupants. H/C is a major source of energy consumption in residential buildings around the world. Studies revealed that the thermal properties of building materials are converted into the same unit as thermal resistance (R) in the USA, Canada, The UK, Australia, and other countries. However, none of the previous studies have considered the adaptation of national insulation codes to reduce electricity cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the correlations of energy consumption (Q) to thermal resistances (R) of the building envelop (A). Therefore, this study attempts to review the optimum energy consumption of a selected house due to H/C at different choices of national code standardized R values. Accurate envelop areas (A) of the selected house components are estimated by applying the Autodesk Revit Building Information Model (BIM) to use in the energy model. The case study critically evaluates the variation of electricity cost, GHG emissions, and selection of the optimized thermostat settings for energy savings in different climatic regions and seasons of a year. Different correlations are obtained using risk analysis software on energy consumptions with code recognized arrays of insulations. This sensitivity analysis result shows that the corelation coefficient of energy consumption with medium-low insulated building envelop (r = 0.44) is more significant than improved, maximum, medium-high, and minimum insulations (r = 0.14â€“0.29) which indicates the insulation range where more emphasis should be put to get an optimized solution. Thus the developed analytical framework supports inclusive decision-making by selecting appropriate kinds of insulation for the design of a sustainable house."

"Opportunities for biodiversity conservation as cities adapt to climate change Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Cities are investing billions of dollars in climate change adaptation to combat the effects of sea-level rise, temperature extremes, increasingly intense storm events, flooding and water scarcity. Natural ecosystems have enormous potential to contribute to city resilience, and so, actions that rely on this approach could sustain considerable co-benefits for biodiversity. In this paper we identify the prevalence of key themes of human adaptation response that could have biodiversity conservation outcomes in cities. We then quantify the area of impact for actions that identify specific targets for greening or green infrastructure that could involve natural ecosystems, providing an indicator of potential co-benefits to biodiversity. We then extrapolate to explore the total area of land that could benefit from catchment management approaches, the area of waterways that could benefit from nature-based improvement of these spaces, and finally the number of threatened species that could benefit across these cities. From 80 city climate adaptation plans analysed, we found that urban greening plays a key role in most adaptation strategies, and represents an enormous opportunity for biodiversity conservation, given the diversity of animal and plant species in urban environments. We show that the ranges of at least 270 threatened species overlap with the area covered by just 58 city adaptation plans, including watershed catchments totalling over 28 million km2. However, an analysis of 80 city adaptation plans (of a total 151 found globally) shows that this opportunity is being missed. Just 18% of the plans assessed contained specific intentions to promote biodiversity. We highlight this missed opportunity, as climate adaptation actions undertaken by cities represent an enormous incipient opportunity for nature conservation. Finally, we encourage planners and city governments to incorporate biological conservation into climate adaption plans, for the mutual benefit of urban societies and their biodiversity."

"Environmental impact of discarded apparel landfilling and recycling Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing Globally, around 87% of discarded textiles ended up in landfill, of which more than 90% are reusable and recyclable. Recycling textile waste to other value-added products is economically feasible. To integrate recycling into the apparel waste stream, it is important to know the environmental benefit and impact of the different recycling options. This study presents the environmental performance of apparel recycling and landfill using the life cycle assessment methodology in terms of climate change, acidification, agricultural land occupation and water depletion. Landfill scenarios and recycling scenarios of post-consumer household discarded apparel waste have been developed in the context of Australia. This study finds that the landfill process of natural apparel waste contributes more environmental impact credit compared to synthetic apparel, and this is mainly credited from the power generation from landfill methane gas captured. This study also specifies that the environmental benefit from the landfill process of discarded apparel depends on the ratio of natural fibre and synthetic fibre in discarded apparel. Integration of recycling into the apparel waste stream can potentially generate environmental benefits. A recycling scenario of cleaning wipes shows the highest impact benefits, followed by cotton fibre, insulation material and polyester raw material recycling. Net impact savings of recycling depend on the avoided landfill impact and avoided virgin production impact. The results generated from this study can be useful for future policy recommendations on apparel waste management through recycling. It is clear that increased collection of apparel by recyclers can significantly reduce environmental impact."

"Locally Decodable Index Codes Side Information; Network Coding; Broadcast Channel An index code for broadcast channel with receiver side information is locally decodable if each receiver can decode its demand by observing only a subset of the transmitted codeword symbols instead of the entire codeword. Local decodability in index coding is known to reduce receiver complexity, improve user privacy and decrease decoding error probability in wireless fading channels. Conventional index coding solutions assume that the receivers observe the entire codeword, and as a result, for these codes the number of codeword symbols queried by a user per decoded message symbol, which we refer to as locality, could be large. In this paper, we pose the index coding problem as that of minimizing the broadcast rate for a given value of locality (or vice versa) and designing codes that achieve the optimal trade-off between locality and rate. We identify the optimal broadcast rate corresponding to the minimum possible value of locality for all single unicast problems. We present new structural properties of index codes which allow us to characterize the optimal trade-off achieved by: vector linear codes when the side information graph is a directed cycle; and scalar linear codes when the minrank of the side information graph is one less than the order of the problem. We also identify the optimal trade-off among all codes, including non-linear codes, when the side information graph is a directed 3-cycle. Finally, we present techniques to design locally decodable index codes for arbitrary single unicast problems and arbitrary values of locality."

"In-the-Moment Experiences of Rural School Principals in the COVID-19 Pandemic Education; Relational Leadership; Widening Participation The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the many existing inequalities in education systems across the world. Not all children have easy access to educational online resources or digital technologies, a situation more amplified in rural contexts where access, connectivity and affordability play a significant factor. This qualitative account reveals examples of how rural school leaders were able to find innovative ways early in the COVID-19 pandemic to address the remote learning needs of their students and families. This paper shares in-the-moment experiences of rural principals, and those who supported them, in quickly transitioning to address student needs when school buildings closed. Support actions of regional and state education agencies are also described. Principalsâ€™ schools are located in rural areas of Kansas, Pennsylvania and Queensland, Australia. Principalsâ€™ attention to place and teacher capacity enabled students and families to access educational offerings and supports in new ways."
"Identifying the essential flood conditioning factors for flood prone area mapping using machine learning techniques Landslides; Debris Flow; Susceptibility River flooding can be a highly destructive natural hazard. Numerous approaches have been used to study the phenomenon; however, insufficient knowledge regarding flood conditioning factors continues to hinder prevention and control measures. This research examines the hypothesis that by adding further conditioning factors to a dataset used in river flood modeling, increases the accuracy of the final susceptibility mapping result. Additionally, this study assesses the impact of individual conditioning factors on flood susceptibility mapping and their importance in the construction of precise mapping of potential flood regions. Two robust machine learning approaches, Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were utilized to evaluate spatial correlations between flood conditioning factors and rate their level of importance for mapping the flood prone areas. For this purpose, two datasets were used; dataset 1 (DS1): Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived factors of altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, Stream Power Index (SPI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Topographic Roughness Index (TRI), and Sediment Transport Index (STI) and dataset 2 (DS2): a combination of LiDAR derived factors supplemented by geology, soil, landuse/cover (LULC), distance from roads and distance from rivers parameters. An extreme flood event in 2011 in Brisbane, Australia was used as a case study, in which DT and SVM techniques were both applied, using both datasets. In addition, multi-collinearity, variance inflation factors (VIF), Pearson's correlation coefficients and Cohen's kappa analysis provided useful information regarding the inter-relationships of factors, as well as the influence of each factor on the precision of the final map. The area under curve (AUC) method was used for accuracy assessment. SVM and DT produced the highest accuracies of prediction, with rates of 85.52% and 88.47% respectively, using DS1 (the LiDAR dataset). Altitude, SPI and TRI were found to have a significant impact on the precision of the outcomes. It was concluded that the inclusion of additional factors in the modeling, does not necessarily guarantee the achievement of greater accuracy. However, the modeling method, can significantly alter outcomes."
"Developing the proton battery and proton flow reactor systems for energy storage. This project will advance two recent RMIT University innovations – the proton battery and proton flow reactor – towards commercialisation through an R&D partnership with the International Institute for Carbon Neutral Energy Research (I2CNER) at Kyushu University, Japan. These technologies are both novel means of storing atomic hydrogen in porous carbon materials and may assist in guaranteeing reliable electrical power from intermittent renewable energy sources. Hence they potentially have major economic benefits and greenhouse emission reduction potential. In particular, the project will pursue new opportunities identified in the course of RMIT University’s project funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and due to finish in October this year.

"Temperature-dependent water retention curve model for both adsorption and capillarity Unsaturated Soil; Soil Water Characteristic; Suction A temperature-dependent water retention curve (WRC) model is necessary in numerous geotechnical engineering cases such as the disposal and storage of nuclear waste, buried high-voltage cables, heat dissipation embankments and geothermal structures. A series of pioneering models attempting to consider the mechanisms of temperature effect have been proposed. Nevertheless, it should be noted that very limited research can be found in the literature to consider temperature effects on both capillarity and adsorption. Thus, a temperature-dependent WRC model for both adsorption and capillarity is developed in this study. An adsorption equation is first proposed by integrating Kelvin equation, Clausiusâ€“Clapeyron equation and the adsorption enthalpy equation. Then, the proposed adsorption equation and an existing capillary equation are incorporated into Petersâ€“Durnerâ€“Iden (PDI) model to establish the temperature-dependent WRC model. Sixteen series of non-isothermal WRC data are employed to illustrate the application and performances of the proposed model. The proposed WRC model provides good agreement between the predicted and measured temperature-dependent WRCs. Moreover, the main differences between different types of soils are temperature effects on adsorption. The value of parameter Î± gradually increases from sandy soils to bentonite, representing an increasingly strong soilâ€“water interaction and increasingly significant temperature effects on adsorption. By comparing with three existing models, the proposed model is found as the most suitable for describing the observed data."
"Environmental change, urbanisation, and socio-ecological resilience in the Pacific: Community narratives from Port Vila, Vanuatu Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Ecosystem services play a key role in maintaining community resilience and wellbeing; a function increasingly profiled following the publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. However, there is limited understanding of the value of, and threats to, â€˜urbanâ€™ ecosystem services, especially in relation to Small Island Developing States (SIDS). This study uses a bottom-up approach to investigate the provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural benefits of local ecosystems to urban communities in Port Vila, Vanuatu. The project was based on participatory action research carried out for the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) as part of the Pacific Ecosystem-based Adaptation to Climate Change Project. Based on a survey of 821 households, and 10 community workshops, this paper provides a narrative of the terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal ecosystem services salient to the livelihoods of vulnerable urban communities. This narrative is set in the context of rapid urbanisation and climate change, which are increasingly undermining community resilience. These findings stress the urgent need to better understand, and account for, complex socio-ecological relationships when developing adaptation policies and urban development plans, not only in Vanuatu but across Oceania's cities and towns."
"Object-based random forest classification for informal settlements identification in the Middle East: Jeddah a case study Remote Sensing Image; Image Analysis; Land Cover The identification of informal settlements in urban areas is an important step in developing and implementing pro-poor urban policies. Understanding when, where and who lives inside informal settlements is critical in efforts to improve their resilience. This study aims to analyse the capability of machine-learning (ML) methods to map informal settlement areas in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, using very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery and terrain data. Fourteen indicators of settlement characteristics were derived and mapped using an object-based ML approach and VHR imagery. These indicators were categorized according to three different spatial levels: environ, settlement and object. The most useful indicators for prediction were found to be density and texture measures, (with random forest (RF) relative importance measures of over 25% and 23% respectively). The success of this approach was evaluated using a small, fully independent validation dataset. Informal areas were mapped with an overall accuracy of 91%. Object-based ML as a processing chain approach performed better (8%) than object-based image analysis alone due to its ability to encompass all available geospatial levels."

"Modelling of supply chain disruption analytics using an integrated approach: An emerging economy example Disruption; Supply Chain Disruptions; Dual Sourcing The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework to identify, analyze, and to assess supply chain disruption factors and drivers. Based on an empirical analysis, four disruption factor categories including natural, human-made, system accidents, and financials with a total of sixteen disruption drivers are identified and examined in a real-world industrial setting. This research utilizes an integrated approach comprising both the Delphi method and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). To test this integrated method, one of the well-known examples in industrial contexts of developing countries, the ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh is considered. To evaluate this industrial example, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to ensure the robustness and viability of the framework in practical settings. This study not only expands the literature scope of supply chain disruption risk assessment but through its application in any context or industry will reduce the impact of such disruptions and enhance the overall supply chain resilience. Consequently, these enhanced capabilities arm managers the ability to formulate relevant mitigation strategies that are robust and computationally efficient. These strategies will allow managers to take calculated decisions proactively. Finally, the results reveal that political and regulatory instability, cyclones, labor strikes, flooding, heavy rain, and factory fires are the top six disruption drivers causing disruptions to the ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh."

"Zero energy in the built environment: A holistic understanding Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building International pressures through global agreements such as the recent Paris agreement in 2015 have put stress on governments and industries to find lasting solutions for the built environment. The built environment was recognized as an important factor in reducing global emissions for the first time at the Conference of Parties (COP) 21 meeting in Paris through a dedicated 'Buildings Day.' The Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction (GlobalABC) was also launched at COP 21 as a network to globally support zero emission, efficient and resilient buildings and construction sector. The Paris Agreement brought all nations to collectively combat climate change with a view to limit temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees Celsius (Â°C). Nations agreed to report their efforts through the monitoring program. In most countries, residential and commercial buildings spend a large proportion of their energy in lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning and in various appliances requiring energy for operation. This paper takes a broad understanding of zero energy. Starting with buildings, the definitions also consider understanding zero energy and from a carbon perspective, considering going from beyond buildings to include precincts and cities. The paper brings an understanding of zero energy, its importance, and its urgency with respect to global commitments to reduce the impact of the building and construction sector and the role of governments and industries in supporting the lowering of emissions in the built environment now and in the future."

"Severity, pathogenicity and transmissibility of delta and lambda variants of SARS-CoV-2, toxicity of spike protein and possibilities for future prevention of COVID-19 Nasopharyngeal Swabs; Serologic Tests; COVID-19 The World Health Organization reports that SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 220 million people and claimed over 4.7 million lives globally. While there are new effective vaccines, the differences in behavior of variants are causing challenges in vaccine development or treatment. Here, we discuss Delta, a variant of concern, and Lambda, a variant of interest. They demonstrate high infectivity and are less responsive to the immune response in vaccinated individuals. In this review, we briefly summarize the reason for infectivity and the severity of the novel variants. Delta and Lambda variants exhibit more changes in NSPs proteins and the S protein, compared to the original Wuhan strain. Lambda also has numerous amino acid substitutions in NSPs and S proteins, plus a deletion in the NTD of S protein, leading to partial escape from neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in vaccinated individuals. We discuss the role of furin protease and the ACE2 receptor in virus infection, hotspot mutations in the S protein, the toxicity of the S protein and the increased pathogenicity of Delta and Lambda variants. We discuss future therapeutic strategies, including those based on high stability of epitopes, conservation of the N protein and the novel intracellular antibody receptor, tripartite-motif protein 21 (TRIM21) recognized by antibodies against the N protein."

"Conditional altruism: Effects of HRM practices on the willingness of host-country nationals to help expatriates Self-initiated Expatriates; International Assignments; Expatriates The assistance of host-country nationals (HCNs) both within the workplace and in the external environment plays a significant role in expatriate adjustment and work performance on international assignments. Extant research exploring antecedents of HCNs' attitudes and behaviors toward expatriates focuses on personal and intrapersonal factors but overlooks organizational contextual effects. In this study, we propose and test a model that HCNs' willingness to help expatriates is influenced by HRM practices in international subsidiaries of multinational enterprises (MNEs). Results of analyzing data collected from Chinese subsidiaries of South Korean MNEs showed that high-commitment HRM practices directly and indirectly influence HCNs' willingness to help expatriates through the mediation of perceived organizational support (POS). Socially responsible HRM indirectly influences the criterion variable through the mediation of organizational identification. Moreover, POS and organizational identification sequentially mediate the effect of high-commitment HRM on HCNs' willingness to help expatriates. These findings shed some light on organizational antecedents that go beyond personal and intrapersonal factors of HCN attitudes and behavior toward expatriates."

"Understanding opportunities for social impact investment in the development of affordable housing Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Key findings This is the first study examining the opportunities for, barriers to, and risks for SII in the development of affordable housing in Australia. It considers both social housing and affordable housing supply. Social impact investment (SII) SIIs are those that intentionally target specific social objectives along with a financial return and measure the achievement of both (SIIT 2014a: 2). SII funds can be placed directly by investors or through intermediaries who specialise (sometimes exclusively) in placing SII funds. Intermediaries often, but not always, pool funds. Intermediaries take responsibility for measuring and reporting of impact. The return expectations and assets classes can differ: investors willing to accept concessionary returns (i.e. a below market return) are considered 'impact-first' investors while those requiring non-concessionary returns equal or near equal to market are considered to be 'finance-first' investors (Brest and Born 2013). Deals can be complex, involving other SI investors, concessionary and non-concessionary investment, non-SI investors and philanthropic and other grants. Such deals are termed 'layered' investments. Investment can involve debt, equity or both. The SI investors Westpac Banking Corporation, Community Sector Banking and Bank Australia are the largest SI investors in social and affordable housing in Australia, by virtue of lending to CHPs. Westpac has $1.05 billion invested in the CHP sector (Westpac 2016). Total bank SII in the CHP sector is possibly as much as $1.5 billion at present. This investment is all debt investment. Returns are non-concessionary. Historically, access to capital has been difficult for CHPs and investment has required reconsideration of risk and a shift in credit assessment. This change may or may not have been led by SI investors (further research would be required to answer this question). The participation of bank SI investors however adds competition ensuring all CHPs gain more competitively priced capital and more suitable conditions on finance. Given the concentration of the Australian banking sector (Bryant 2012) this competition is important. This bank SII therefore could be said to be providing 'additionality'. A far smaller $20 million is invested in housing models outside of the registered CHP sector, by non-bank SI investors. These include the Lord Mayors Charitable Foundation (LMCF) who provided $3 million to the Affordable Housing Loan Fund (AHLF), small superannuation funds, high net worth individuals (HNWI), other individuals, philanthropy, self-managed superannuation funds (SMSF), and not-for-profit (NFP) organisations. This $20 million is equal parts debt and equity investment. The equity investors in these models were the only investors to accept concessionary returns. They were supporting innovative models that have the potential for systemic change rather than simply providing housing. Intermediaries Three intermediaries, Foresters Community Finance (FCF), Social Enterprise Finance Australia (SEFA) and Social Ventures Australia (SVA) are currently responsible for the placement of the majority of non-bank SII in social/affordable housing in Australia. These intermediaries have attracted funds from HNWI, NAB, Triodos Bank, Community Sector Banking, Christian Super, HESTA, and the NSW Aboriginal Land Council. These intermediaries are highly respected. All three funds were established following an Australian Government initiative, the Social Enterprise Development and Investment Funds (SEDIFs) that provided $20 million in matched funding. Christian Super recently established its own intermediary, Bright Light. Demand side for investment CHPs are the largest source of demand for funds and represent the only established system of social and affordable housing provision that comprises an at-scale opportunity for expanded SII, which meets the requirements for verifiable impact over time. The opportunity for SII is limited however by CHP sector constraints (issues well documented, see Milligan, Hulse, et al. 2013; Milligan, Pawson et al. 2017) including limited free cash flow (to support borrowings), uncertain tenant housing assistance and income support, and reduced discretion over tenant allocation. Government policy change is viewed as a key source of risk affecting investment (current and future). Two other models were able to access mainstream finance but were not part of the CHP sector. There were a number of organisations currently outside the CHP sector unable to access mainstream lending. These projects span income cohorts-from households eligible for public housing to middle income households-and provide both rental and home ownership opportunities. These non-CHP models expressed dissatisfaction with the existing CHP model and with market provision. A new SII typology SII in Australia does not fit the simple impact-first versus finance-first investment typology found in the literature. Investor reconceptualisation of risk and modification of lending practices occurred in addition to consideration of return requirements. This was not a case of accepting greater risk but rather of reviewing the generally accepted credit assessment practice. Figure 1 describes this new Australian SII typology, which adds whether the investor adopted an orthodox or 'reformed' approach to credit assessment in addition to their approach to returns. Using this new typology, we find that most SII in Australia can be described as partial finance-first, reflecting a combination of non-concessionary returns and modified investment parameters. A far smaller proportion of SII is full impact-first, in that concessionary returns were acceptable and investment parameters were modified. We found no fully finance-first or partial impact-first investment. Barriers and opportunities The CHP sector is the target of most SII, and most existing and potential SI investors wish to see the sector greatly expanded. Government capital grants are regarded as necessary to grow the sector and enable SII at a greater scale. Investment is currently constrained by the lack of CHP free cash flow, rather than lack of collateral required for security. Adverse changes to welfare and housing assistance, and government policy restricting housing allocations to the highest priority applicants on public housing waiting lists were identified as affecting CHP cash flow and as such presenting a risk to investment. Policy development options SII in social and affordable housing reflects government investment. As private investment, there is an expectation of returns on investment. Investment therefore only occurs when the housing organisation is able to generate a positive cash flow to support debt repayment or disbursements to equity holders. This requires the gap between tenant's capacity to pay and the cost of housing provision to be funded by government. The funding of this gap provides an implicit government guarantee. In the Australian context, this requires: â€¢ An annual funding stream for CHPs to close the gap between rental revenues and cost of provision. â€¢ State and territory governments to permit CHPs discretion in who they house so that investor confidence can be maintained (in the absence of a funding stream to meet the gap between rental revenues and cost of provision). â€¢ An annual capital grants program for CHPs to grow the sector. â€¢ Growth of the sector to create the conditions for bond financing-bonds lower the cost of capital and provide for long tenure debt. â€¢ Welfare entitlements and housing assistance to provide sufficient income to all household types to ensure the most vulnerable households will be attractive to house. Social security entitlements need to be stable in order to provide confidence to investors regarding their existing investments as well as future investments. Housing supply bonds were viewed as a key opportunity for reducing the cost of capital and enabling long tenure debt. Land is a critical issue affecting affordability of housing and access to employment and services by vulnerable households. â€¢ Government are frequently owners of well-located land that is surplus to their requirements. Governments could grant such surplus government land to CHPs (as is envisaged by part 21(k) of the National Affordable Housing Agreement (NAHA)). â€¢ Inclusionary zoning could be implemented to provide a new source of social and affordable housing on existing redevelopment sites. Inclusionary zoning would provide the opportunity for layered investment models, common in the US. â€¢ Governments could consider capturing the uplift in value when re-zoning land, through making part of rezoned sites available to CHPs or other NFP housing providers. SII in new home ownership models is able to generate affordable housing supply for both low-income and intermediate income cohorts. The growth of some of these models could be assisted through: â€¢ Government guarantees to permit debt financing and negate the need for substantial equity contributions. â€¢ Revolving funds to provide equity to development projects. The equity would be returned once mortgage loans are issued. The market price of housing for purchase is affected by many factors. However, there has been little scrutiny of the development process and particularly of multi-unit residential development. Profit margins in this sector are high, suggesting competition is less effective than it could be. There is a need for policy-makers to gain a detailed understanding of residential property development and possible industry reforms to improve efficiency. SII would be assisted by: â€¢ As fiduciary duties of superannuation fund managers appear to be open to interpretation, government could review this aspect of superannuation fund management to provide legal clarity for concessionary SII. The study This report presents findings from a research project conducted as part of a broader AHURI Inquiry into social impact investment for housing and homelessness outcomes (Muir, Findlay et al. forthcoming). The purpose of this research is to investigate what contribution SII can make to increasing the supply of affordable housing through providing a detailed analysis of: i) SII in affordable housing internationally and in Australia, ii) opportunities and risks for SII in Australia, iii) barriers to investment, iv) potential for innovation and v) measures government and other parties can take to encourage investment. To date there has been no review of SII in the development of social and affordable housing in Australia. While SII is increasingly of interest in relation to homelessness and housing vulnerability, its application to housing supply has not attracted the same kind of policy attention, despite international and Australian examples. Little therefore is known of investments, the quantum of investment, who the investors are, their motivations or the impact arising from their investment. The registered CHP sector is often presumed to constitute the demand for SII funds. Intermediaries have been established, and many are keen to funnel SII into housing. Much of the advocacy for SII has centred on superannuation funds and on housing supply bonds as a means to attract superannuation funds with CHPs. It is a discussion that reflects a deep concern about the lack of affordable housing stock and mounting frustration at the lack of opportunities for investment. In order to appreciate the implications of private investment including SII, in the supply of social and affordable housing it is necessary to understand residential development financing, and specifically project finance. As we will outline however, private investment in social and affordable housing is not a straightforward matter. This research involved: â€¢ a review of national and international literature on SII in affordable housing â€¢ analysis of in-depth interviews with experts in government, and with SI investors and intermediaries, and CHPs about the definition of SII, its purpose in relation to social/affordable housing, how it has been applied and its benefits in regard to the supply of social and affordable housing in Australia."
"Detection of Miamiensis avidus (Ciliophora: Scuticociliatia) and Cardicola spp. (Trematoda: Aporocotylidae) DNA in biofouling from Southern Bluefin Tuna, Thunnus maccoyii pontoons off Port Lincoln, South Australia Opecoelidae; Digenea (Trematoda); Animals Presence of biofouling on pontoons and other structures can have adverse effects on fish health, both by affecting water quality and acting as a reservoir for pathogens. This study focused on three species of parasites affecting Southern Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) (SBT): the blood flukes Cardicola forsteri and Cardicola orientalis and the scuticociliate Miamiensis avidus. Blood flukes are the main health concern for SBT. They have two free living stages (miracidium and cercaria) and their intermediate host can be present in biofouling. Miamiensis avidus (Ciliophora: Scuticociliata) is an opportunistic pathogen thought to be the causative agent of swimmer syndrome in SBT. To determine if biofouling is a reservoir for blood flukes or M. avidus six perspex plates and six net pieces were deployed in two SBT pontoons at one and four meter depths and sampled one and three months after deployment. Biofouling samples were rarely positive for blood fluke DNA based on qPCR detection, but they were most frequently detected on plate samples at 3 months. Prevalence of Miamiensis avidus based on qPCR detection increased from 38% at one month to 89% at three months. No significant difference was observed between depths at which the plates were deployed. Miamiensis avidus was detected from total DNA extracted from a wide range of taxonomic groups collected from the fouling samples. Results suggest that biofouling may act as a reservoir for M. avidus in aquaculture. Monitoring environmental reservoirs may be an important non-destructive surveillance tool. Further optimization of the detection in biofouling may provide insights into host-pathogen interactions which will inform aquatic animal health management. This approach could also be applied to the surveillance of other potential aquaculture pathogens affecting species farmed in marine pontoons."

"The emerging role of Financial Counsellors in supporting Older Persons in financial hardship and with management of Consumer-directed Care packages within Australia Mental Health; Health Literacy; First Aid The role of financial counsellors as providers of information, support and advocacy for those in financial difficulty is a well established mechanism in the mainstream welfare landscape in Australia. In general, the role of financial counsellors is in helping people alleviate or resolve their financial difficulties through improvement of their financial literacy. It is recognised as an important component of policy responses to assist low-income households and individuals in financial stress. The use of financial counsellors for older persons (i.e., those aged 65+ years) however appears to be underutilised. Financial hardship and abuse of older persons within our community are becoming key issues as the population of Australia â€œagesâ€. Existing evidence also suggests that service providers alone do not have adequate skills to address these issues. This paper firstly examines the development of financial counselling in Australia. It then examines the newly emerging role of financial counselling in supporting older persons in addressing barriers to financial literacy and then in navigating the complex landscape of aged care service provision. The current finacialisation, marketisation and complexities of consumer-directed care are identified as key contextual factors. The paper will then discuss an evaluation study of the provision of financial counselling to the older person population designed to support financial hardship and navigation of the complex aged care services system. The findings of the paper are based on an evaluation of the Financial Consumer Rights Council (FCRC), Victoria: Dignity and Debt Financial Difficulty and Getting Older initiative. This pilot initiative included older persons from both community-based and aged care residential facilities in one regional area of Victoria. The initiative, conducted over 2016, was designed to assess the effectiveness of one-on-one financial counselling sessions with older persons that provided consumer advocacy and information about support services and entitlements (including hardship protections) associated with ageing. The evaluation found that the provision of financial counselling to the older person population could be a key mechanism in improving overall financial literacy, avoiding periods of financial hardship and in maintaining financial well-being, quality of life and positive ageing. Findings also demonstrated a need for an expanded model of outreach financial counselling model to better service older persons in more isolated living environments and/or with mobility impairments living in the community, and the potential to situate offices of financial counsellors within medical centres (a space often visited by the ageing population), to co-situate financial health check-ups as an overall element of health and well-being. As such, financial counselling was viewed as well-placed to support older persons in improvement of financial literacy and in supporting navigation of the increasingly complex marketised and consumer-directed care (CDC) landscape of aged care service provision in Australia."

"‘So, What is a Good Masculinity?’: Navigating Normativity in Violence Prevention with Men and Boys Young; Sex Education; Sexuality Engaging men and boys to address the links between masculinity and gendered violence is a rapidly expanding space for primary prevention, in Australia and globally. There are parallel debates within feminist commentary on violence prevention and in masculinity studies over how to conceptualise and deconstruct masculinity for the long-term transformation of gender inequality. This article analyses semi-structured interviews with Australian prevention practitioners whose work focuses on engaging men and boys, which included initiatives aimed at gender equality, healthy masculinity, preventing violence against women, and domestic/family violence prevention. Interviews highlighted that these practitioners are currently grappling with how to address masculinity as a construct and/or a normative process within their work to achieve gender transformative change. These tensions reflect ongoing concerns over reproducing narrow associations between men and masculinity that perpetuate essentialised identity categories. Importantly, I question whether a focus on â€˜positiveâ€™ or â€˜healthyâ€™ masculinities can effectively go beyond the binary gender relations that underpin gendered violence. The research findings suggest a need for greater reflexive and creative thinking around how men and masculinity are (de)centred within violence prevention to better support gender transformation."

"Research project regarding professional standards in the delivery of disability services According to data provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, 18.4% of Victoria’s population are people with a disability. The number of people with disability is increasing due to factors such as population growth, ageing and increased life expectancy. 
In December 2020, Victoria had 118,919 people in Victoria benefiting from the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) including 42,287 people receiving support for the first time. And NDIS participants are only part of the picture. There are many more people who access services and supports from disability workers in Victoria. 
Victorian NDIS participants and other Victorians with a disability who are not eligible for the NDIS have a right to services and supports that are high quality.  A series of inquiries – including the current Royal Commission – have highlighted the 
abuse, violence, neglect and exploitation of people with disability and emphasised the need for reforms that uphold the rights and ensure the safety and wellbeing of people with disability.

"Comparison of Different Hydrocolloids on the Novel Development of Muffins from ""purple Yam"" (Dioscorea alata) Flour in Sensory, Textural, and Nutritional Aspects Gluten-Free Bread; Glutens; Flour Hydrocolloids can act as gluten substitutes to form the structural equivalents of the gluten network in gluten-free bakery products. ""Purple yam""(Dioscorea alata) is one of the underutilized yams in Sri Lanka with high nutritional potential. The overall objective of this study was to develop gluten-free muffins using ""Purple yam""(Dioscorea alata) flour with hydrocolloids (pectin, xanthan gum, and guar gum) and investigate the nutritional composition and selected properties of the muffins. The texture profiles of gluten-free muffins were analyzed through the following parameters: hardness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, etc. The chromameter values were obtained and sensory evaluations for gluten-free muffins were carried out. The highest moisture content was recorded in pectin-incorporated muffins (17.70Â±0.50%). The protein content of all three types of muffins was around 5%. The highest fat content was recorded in pectin-incorporated muffins (19.26Â±0.51%). The ash content of all three types of muffins was around 2%. Potassium was the most predominant element found in each muffin. The hardness of guar gum-incorporated muffin (6379.3Â±135.9 g) was greater than that of the pectin-incorporated one (6082.3Â±23.4 g). Xanthan gum-incorporated muffins had significantly decreased cohesiveness (0.19Â±0.04). The highest springiness was obtained in pectin-incorporated muffin (37.13Â±1.61 mm). The descending order of the chewiness of muffin is pectin-added>xanthan gum-added>guar gum-added sample. According to the sensory evaluation, pectin-incorporated muffin was the best as it had obtained the highest sum of ranks for appearance, color, taste, after taste, and overall acceptability."

"Foaming at the mouth: Ingestion of floral foam microplastics by aquatic animals Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Phenol-formaldehyde plastics are used globally as floral foam and generate microplastics that can enter the environment. This study is the first to describe how aquatic animals interact with this type of microplastic, and the resultant physiological responses. We analysed â€œregular foamâ€ microplastics generated from petroleum-derived phenol-formaldehyde plastic, and â€œbiofoamâ€ microplastics generated from plant-derived phenol-formaldehyde plastic. Regular foam and biofoam microplastics showed similar FTIR spectra. Both types of microplastics were consumed by all six invertebrate species tested: the freshwater gastropod Physa acuta, the marine gastropod Bembicium nanum, the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis, adults and neonates of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna, the marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa, and nauplii of the marine crustacean Artemia sp. For all species, the occurrence of ingestion was similar for regular foam and biofoam microplastics. Biofoam microplastics leached more than twice as much phenolic compounds than regular foam microplastics. The leachates from regular foam and biofoam microplastics showed the same acute toxicity to Artemia nauplii (24-h LC50 = 27.4 mg mLâˆ’ 1 and 22.8 mg mLâˆ’ 1, respectively) and D. magna (48-h LC50 = 17.8 mg mLâˆ’ 1 and 15.3 mg mLâˆ’ 1, respectively). However, biofoam microplastic leachate was twice as toxic to embryos of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, compared with leachate from regular foam microplastic (96-h LC50 = 43.8 mg mLâˆ’ 1 vs 27.1 mg mLâˆ’ 1). Using M. galloprovincialis, we show that regular foam microplastic leachate and the physical presence of the microplastics exerted separate and cumulative effects on catalase (CAT) activity, glutathione-s-transferase (GST) activity and lipid peroxidation. Microplastic ingestion did not affect the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Taken together, these results show that phenol-formaldehyde microplastics can interact with a range of aquatic animals, and affect sublethal endpoints by leaching toxic compounds, and through the physical presence of the microplastics themselves."

"Time mapping: charting transcultural and First Nations histories and geographies in doctoral education Research Personnel; Doctorate; Supervisors In this article, we introduce a time mapping methodology to chart the impact of transcultural and First Nationsâ€™ histories, geographies and cultural knowledges on doctoral education. Drawing upon a â€˜Southernâ€™, postcolonial-decolonial theoretical framing and extending textual life history methodologies, we argue that time mapping is a visual methodology that has the power to disrupt managerial, auditing discourses that have come to dominate present understandings of doctoral education. We present the time maps of migrant, international candidates and Australian First Nations candidates and supervisors, creating spaces for narratives of migration, war, discrimination, destruction, colonisation, change, survival, faith, energy, language and cultural revival, growth, inspiration and the power of Country. We seek to re-humanise discourses about doctoral education."

"Scenarios of energy reduction potential of zero energy building promotion in the Asia-Pacific region to year 2050 Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation Building energy consumption in the Asia-Pacific region continues to rise. It is important to understand the energy use and future trends of 21 members of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and to find more effective ways to achieve APEC's dual goals of reducing energy intensity by 45% of 2005 levels by 2035 and doubling the share of renewable energy in the energy mix between 2010 and 2030. Recently, promoting building toward ultra-low energy, nearly zero energy and zero energy is becoming a consensus trend. This paper aims to explore how zero energy building promotion could influence the total energy demand in the mid to long term. An EUPP (Economic, Urbanization, Population and Purchasing power parity) model was established to show the relationship between building energy consumption and its influencing factors, and the potential development path of building energy consumption in APEC was predicted by using the model. The results show that in the Business As Usual (BAU) model, building energy demand will increase from 1387.4 Mtoe in 2016 to 2456.8 Mtoe in 2050 while in the CAP model, building energy demand will be constrained to under 2000 Mtoe before 2050. In the ZEB promotion model, 897.8 to 1945.3 Mtoe could be saved separately. The share of end demand supplied by onsite renewable energy production could reach 11%â€“54%. The building sector has the potential to become the largest contributor to achieve the APEC energy goal and thus to the climate change goal."

"Sustainable food drying technologies based on renewable energy sources Thin-Layer Drying; Drying; Solar Dryers Waste in the food supply chain is estimated to be about 30â€“40% of the total food production, which aggravates the world hunger and increases waste management burden and environmental impact. Despite the dire food scarcity, majority of this food waste takes place in developing countries because of the lack of appropriate and affordable preservation techniques. Traditional open sun drying is the most popular food-reservation technique to the local farmers due to near-zero capital cost and cheap labor cost. However, this method is highly energy intensive, unhygienic, and time demanding. The high energy consumption resulting from uncontrolled simultaneous heat, mass, and momentum transfer processes in traditional drying systems highlights the necessity of pursuing sustainability in drying process targeting reduced energy consumption, environmental and social impacts. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the sustainable food drying technologies based on renewable energy sources, with emphasis on the developing countries. It was observed that the integration of thermal energy storage with heat pump makes the integrated drying system more efficient, and dries food with better quality. Likewise, advanced integrated drying systems, such as, solar with microwave, and heat pump with microwave make the drying process more cost and quality competent. Finally, impact of resource distribution and governmental incentives for renewable energy use in sustainable drying is discussed."

"Gut Microbial Changes, Interactions, and Their Implications on Human Lifecycle: An Ageing Perspective Intestine Flora; Ruminococcaceae; Microorganisms Gut microbiota is established during birth and evolves with age, mostly maintaining the commensal relationship with the host. A growing body of clinical evidence suggests an intricate relationship between the gut microbiota and the immune system. With ageing, the gut microbiota develops significant imbalances in the major phyla such as the anaerobic Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as well as a diverse range of facultative organisms, resulting in impaired immune responses. Antimicrobial therapy is commonly used for the treatment of infections; however, this may also result in the loss of normal gut flora. Advanced age, antibiotic use, underlying diseases, infections, hormonal differences, circadian rhythm, and malnutrition, either alone or in combination, contribute to the problem. This nonbeneficial gastrointestinal modulation may be reversed by judicious and controlled use of antibiotics and the appropriate use of prebiotics and probiotics. In certain persistent, recurrent settings, the option of faecal microbiota transplantation can be explored. The aim of the current review is to focus on the establishment and alteration of gut microbiota, with ageing. The review also discusses the potential role of gut microbiota in regulating the immune system, together with its function in healthy and diseased state."

"FROM RULED SURFACES TO ELASTICA-RULED SURFACES: NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR CREATING ARCHITECTURAL FORMS Elastic Rods; Inextensible; Cosserat Theory Ruled surfaces are widely used for architectural forms, as diverse 3D shapes can be conveniently generated by the movement of a straight ruling. There is vast potential to create a rich variety of new architectural forms by introducing curved rulings into ruled surfaces. This paper presents a new method to generate ruled surface variants by making a fundamental change to existing ruled surfaces through parametric reformulation and the use of curved rulings. A new type of ruled surface composed of curved rulings, the elastica-ruled surface, is proposed. An analytical geometric modelling method is developed based on the transformation of line-ruled surfaces, enabling convenient generation of elegant shapes and forms for architectural applications. In this paper, curved rulings are represented by elastica curvesâ€”large, elastic, bending deformations of a straight slender beam. We demonstrate that elastica curve design parameters can completely control the shape of an elastica-ruled surface and define a large set of transformation results. This study classifies elastica-ruled surfaces into five categories based on their shape characteristics. Potential applications of elastica-ruled surfaces that consider elastic bending behaviour are presented, including bending-active structures, robot-assisted manufacturing and kinetic architectural designs. By extension, this study shows that adopting higher-order elastica curves can further enhance the design diversity of novel architectural forms."

"Making home or making do: a critical look at homemaking without a home Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease This paper critically examines the concept of alternative forms of â€˜homemakingâ€™ among people without a settled home. The introductory section establishes the framework for the paper, providing an overview of homelessness and the homemaking literature. Strengths in the homemaking approach are identified, which reconceptualises homelessness as a human-centered phenomenon that can be understood as â€˜resistanceâ€™ to societies that block accesses to mainstream housing for people who are (also) socially and economically marginalised. Homemaking moves beyond mainstream academic analyses which explore homelessness in terms of â€˜sinâ€™ (addiction and criminality), â€˜sicknessâ€™ (poor health, especially poor mental health) and â€˜systemsâ€™ (housing market failure and inadequate social protection and public health systems). The paper argues that, while important in refreshing our thinking about homelessness by offering a new, radical epistemology of housing, homemaking is limited by not contextualising the dwelling practices it seeks to explain, particularly in respect of how it defines â€˜homelessnessâ€™ and also risks misinterpreting transitory behavioural adaptations as something deeper."

"A scalable blockchain based trust management in VANET routing protocol Network Security; Location Privacy; Revocation Critical event information dissemination has been proliferating on VANET allowing road safety via connected vehicular communications. Despite the prospect of promising applications in vehicular networks, it faces unresolved challenges that hold the capability to slow down network performance upon deployment, especially in terms of security. Particularly, insider attacks such as Blackhole attacks that are carried out against VANET systems can disrupt the networksâ€™ average performance and prevent communication between vehicles entirely. Many state-of-the-art solutions have been proposed to detect and eliminate such nodes based on reputation systems and broadcast routing. However, if the network consists of multiple malicious nodes, the message dissemination could fail due to broadcast message tampering attack or packet dropping. In this study, we explore to answer the question of â€œcan we improve the insider attacks mitigation in VANET by enhancing the trust in the network system so that the possibility of successful attacks can be reduced?â€. To answer this question, in this paper, we present the blockchain-based decentralized trust score framework for the participating nodes to detect and blacklist insider attackers in VANET proactively. We propose a two-level detection system, in which at the first level, neighboring nodes calculate the trust individually. In the second level, a consortium blockchain-based system with authorized Road Side Units (RSUs) as validators, aggregate trust scores for vehicular nodes. Then, based on trust scores reported by the neighboring nodes, the blacklist node tables are dynamically modified. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed system is efficient and scalable in terms of the network's practical size. Finally, we also present evidence that the proposed system improves the VANET performance by mitigating and blacklisting insider attack launching nodes."

"Banking on the market: Mobile phones and social goods provision in Haiti Haiti; Border; Voodoo The role of the market in the provision of â€œsocial goodsâ€ (SÃ¶derbaum 2005) has been at the fore of academic discussions over the past few decades as governments and other state actors outsource their provisioning to corporations and other market mechanisms (Schwittay 2011). In Haiti, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have played a significant role in this shift, due to their capacity to act as â€œplatformsâ€ for service delivery (Kendall et al. 2012). However, the â€œmarketizationâ€ of services is by no means complete. Drawing upon research carried out in Haiti between 2010â€“2012, we demonstrate how the models that promote the use of ICTs for social purposes tend to bring together alliances of market and non-market forces, relying on the different affordances of each to structure service delivery for commercial and non-commercial ends. Rather than a one-way shift from state provisioning to the commercialization of social goods, their delivery mechanisms have changed routinely throughout Haitian history. We argue that these features are often overlooked in analyses of â€œneoliberalismâ€ that present the decline of state service provision as a one-directional movement towards marketization."

"Numerical and experimental evaluation of a Dual-Fuel Dry- Low-NOx micromix combustor for industrial gas turbine applications Combustion Chambers; Gas Turbines; Hydrogen The dry-low-NOx (DLN) micromix combustion technology has been developed originally as a low emission alternative for industrial gas turbine combustors fueled with hydrogen. Currently, the ongoing research process targets flexible fuel operation with hydrogen and syngas fuel. The nonpremixed combustion process features jet-in-crossflow-mixing of fuel and oxidizer and combustion through multiple miniaturized flames. The miniaturization of the flames leads to a significant reduction of NOx emissions due to the very short residence time of reactants in the flame. The paper presents the results of a numerical and experimental combustor test campaign. It is conducted as part of an integration study for a dual-fuel (H2 and H2/CO 90/10 vol %) micromix (MMX) combustion chamber prototype for application under full scale, pressurized gas turbine conditions in the auxiliary power unit Honeywell Garrett GTCP 36-300. In the presented experimental studies, the integration-optimized dual-fuel MMX combustor geometry is tested at atmospheric pressure over a range of gas turbine operating conditions with hydrogen and syngas fuel. The experimental investigations are supported by numerical combustion and flow simulations. For validation, the results of experimental exhaust gas analyses are applied. Despite the significantly differing fuel characteristics between pure hydrogen and hydrogen-rich syngas, the evaluated dual-fuel MMX prototype shows a significant low NOx performance and high combustion efficiency. The combustor features an increased energy density that benefits manufacturing complexity and costs."

The VAMPIRE index is developed using spatial modelling techniques. The VAMPIRE index is developed using spatial modelling techniques. Four input variables will be used in the model: (1) household weekly income; (2) proportion of households owning two or more vehicles; (3) proportion of people traveling to work by car; and (4) number of homes being purchased with a mortgage. The method of calculating the VAMPIRE index involves standard ranking and weighting procedures for both input variables, and the composite
VAMPIRE index will be calculated using the following equation:
VAMPIRE index = (proportion of households own two or more vehicles) + (proportion of people travel to work by car) + (household weekly income x 2) + (proportion of homes are being purchased with a mortgage x 2).
The VAMPIRE index will be produced at SA2 level covering the urban area of each of Australia's state capital city.

"COVID-19, social isolation and the mental health of autistic people and their families: A qualitative study Psychological Support; Mindfulness; COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic and its policy responses have had a detrimental effect on millions of peopleâ€™s mental health. Here, we investigate its impact on autistic people and their families using qualitative methods. Specifically, we addressed: how did autistic people experience an increase in social isolation during the initial lockdown? And how was their mental health impacted by lockdown? Autistic and non-autistic researchers conducted 144 semi-structured interviews with autistic adults (n = 44), parents of autistic children (n = 84) including autistic parents and autistic young people (n = 16). We deployed thematic analysis to identify key themes. The enhanced social isolation accompanying the pandemic had a serious and damaging impact on autistic peopleâ€™s mental health and subjective wellbeing. They spoke of intensely missing friends and more incidental forms of social connection. They also reported intense dissatisfaction with the substitution of embodied, person-to-person connection in health services by online/telephone-based alternatives, sometimes accompanied by serious negative consequences. These findings reveal the fundamental importance of supporting autistic people to maintain direct and incidental social contact during the pandemic and beyond. They speak against established theories that downplay autistic peopleâ€™s need for human connection and the extent to which they have been affected by social isolation during lockdowns. Lay abstract: In this study, we show that autistic people and their families have found it very difficult to deal with the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Autistic and non-autistic researchers spoke to 144 people, including 44 autistic adults, 84 parents of autistic children and 16 autistic young people (12â€“18 years old). We asked them about their everyday lives and mental health during lockdown. People told us that they enjoyed having fewer obligations and demands compared to pre-COVID-19 life. They felt that life was quieter and calmer. But people also told us again and again how much they missed meeting people in real life, especially their friends, and their therapists and support workers. People told us that their mental health suffered because they did not have contact with their friends and services. Importantly, many people (including researchers) think that autistic people do not want friends or to be around people. But our results show that is not true. Many autistic people do want friends and to be around other people. Some peopleâ€™s mental health has been damaged by not being able to see people during COVID-19. Autistic people need support in many areas of life so they can keep socialising and seeing their friends even through difficult times, like pandemics."
"Life cycle assessment, energy balance and sensitivity analysis of bioethanol production from microalgae in a tropical country Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Overuse of petroleum and ongoing carbon-di-oxide (CO2) rise in the air of Brunei Darussalam has been emerged as a major environmental concern in this country. To resolve this issue, a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of alternative biofuel, bioethanol production from microalgae was demanded for realistic implementation. Therefore, LCA of bioethanol production from microalgae in terms of CO2 emission and energy balance was investigated based on the scenario of industrial-scale in Brunei Darussalam. This study demonstrated that 220 tons microalgae biomass was cultivated on 6 ha offshore lands for commercial bioethanol generation. The annual outcome of this commercial bioethanol plant has revealed net CO2 balance 218.86 ton. From the energy perspective, this study manifested itself as favourable with net energy ratio, 0.45 and net energy balance, âˆ’2749.6 GJ yâˆ’1. Apart from CO2 balance and energy generation aspect, the project demanded low water and land footprints. For photobioreactor cultivation, water and land footprints were 2 m3 GJâˆ’1 and 2 m2 GJâˆ’1, respectively as well as for open pond approach, they were 87 m3 GJâˆ’1 and 13 m2 GJâˆ’1, respectively. The project also presented microalgae growth supplements (phosphorus and nitrogen) accumulation possibilities from wastewater of manure and industries which is another positive aspect for benign environment. Overall, the commercial plant presented low CO2 emission, low land and water demand for microalgae cultivation, alternative eco-friendly and cheaper nutrients sources, quite high energy generation with main product and by-products. Thus, this study projected positive impact on energy and environmental aspects of microalgae-to-bioethanol conversion."

"Hierarchical doped gelatin-derived carbon aerogels: Three levels of porosity for advanced supercapacitors Carbon; Electrode Materials; Carbon Nanofibers Nitrogen-doped graphene-based aerogels with three levels of hierarchically organized pores were prepared via a simple environmentally friendly process, and successfully tested in supercapacitor applications. Mesopores and macropores were formed during the aerogel preparation followed by carbonization and its chemical activation by potassium hydroxide (KOH). These mesopores and macropores consist of amorphous carbon and a 3D graphene framework. Thermal treatment at 700â—¦C, 800â—¦C, 900â—¦C in N2 atmosphere was done to etch out the amorphous carbon and obtain a stable N-doped 3D graphene. Specific capacitance values obtained from the electrochemical measurements are in the range of 232â€“170 FÃ— gâˆ’1 . The thus fabricated structures showed excellent cyclic stability, suggesting that these materials have potential as electrodes for solid asymmetric supercapacitors."

"Implementing the UN SDGs in Universities: Challenges, Opportunities, and Lessons Learned Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development The education sector is one of the few sectors that can support, promote, and contribute to achieving all of the 17 United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Universities, in particular, are essential to achieving the SDGs because they can equip the next generation with the skills, knowledge, and understanding to address sustainability challenges and opportunities and perform research that advances the sustainable development agenda. Universities can also provide examples and use their expertise, capabilities, and leadership to influence stakeholders to adopt and model more sustainable practices. To be effective, however, universities should be fully committed to support and implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The SDGs are an important vehicle for creating positive impact by embedding sustainability into university business strategies, decision-making processes, and practices, and for improving their accountability to stakeholders. This article aims to contribute to research and practice fostering discussions and sharing the experience of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University in Melbourne, Australia, in undertaking an ambitious and innovative project to raise awareness, foster collaboration, measure impact, and communicate the university's contributions toward achieving the SDGs across the entire university."

"Do 'Green' academic buildings actually support teaching and learning? Indoor Air Pollution; Indoor Environmental Quality; Carbon Dioxide There are pressures to showcase adoption of green buildings in universities for several reasons, including, demonstrating leadership, aligning with sustainability vision of the university and â€œwalking the talkâ€. New generation learning and teaching spaces are moving away from the model of didactic teaching and learning towards two-way teaching and learning models. While university buildings are incorporating such new teaching and learning models into their buildings, there is little or no evidence that green teaching spaces are actually supporting student learning outcomes. In comparison, the literature is rich with post occupancy and thermal comfort studies undertaken in green office spaces. This paper presents a case study of a green building in a Victorian university in Australia. The building was considered to be an example of Australian excellence and has received a number of awards. Using one classroom in the building, the researchers monitored the temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 levels in this classroom during a two week peak period of a summer intensive program. The findings suggest that this particular classroom did not always provide comfortable conditions for teaching and learning. More research is required to draw definitive conclusions."

"Negotiating Indonesian Married Women’s Agency in a Career: Work From Home Arrangement as a Possible Solution Personnel; Teleworker; Flexible Working Financial challenges have led to the emergence of dual-earner couples. Nonetheless, in male-dominated societies like Indonesia, womenâ€™s career involvement, although contributing to the household income, is not correlated with menâ€™s contribution to the household task. A career is seen as a privilege for women because their primary value is conventionally anchored on marriage and family. International studies suggested that the Work From Home (WFH) arrangement is an effective solution to enable women to balance their work and family roles. While WFH was nonexistent in Indonesia before the COVID-19 pandemic, the latter forced companies to adopt the former. This provided an opportunity to examine whether WFH can be a remedy for working Indonesian women to negotiate their work and family roles. Hence this study is aimed to look closely at the issue, comprising two general aims. First, it provides a general picture of current practices of division of gender in Indonesia using current literature. Second, using online survey data from 201 Indonesian workers, this report provides empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of WFH, particularly for married working women in Indonesia in negotiating their work and household roles. While describing current feminism issues in the non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) societies, the article also discusses the long-term practical strategy to empower Indonesian women in careers by emphasizing gender equality while acknowledging the menâ€™s leadership role."
"The Need for the Graduate Attribute Assessment Tool (GAAT) Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Universities have developed sets of Graduate Attributes (GAs) to be achieved by their graduates across all programs. GAs are often associated with development of â€˜sustainabilityâ€™ capabilities. However, there is little indication that sustainability GAs are assessed to determine the extent of achievement, application, relevance to professional practice or to provide feed-back into curriculum design. This paper reports on the development of the Graduate Attributes Assessment Tool (GAAT) to determine achievement of the sustainability GA. The research developed, in 2016, a tool to assess the level of graduate attainment, application and use of a sustainability GA in a graduateâ€™s workplace. The GAAT is unique as it is founded in the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). The tool was trailed on a sample of RMIT graduates and assessed to determine if it was an appropriate tool. The complex nature of the sustainability GA meant that a modified version of the TPB was required. This resulted in the development of questions that required participants to reflect on their behaviour in their workplace in relation to a specific scenario. Additional questions were included to enable feed-back on curriculum to allow for modification to assist sustainability GA achievement. The GAAT pilot indicated that it provided valid outcomes of the achievement of the sustainability GA and insight for curriculum review. Development of the GAAT and its piloting have provided the basis for a practical, flexible tool for assessing sustainability GAs, and has potential for further development into a tool for assessing the wide range of university GAs."

"Influence of soil moisture regimes on growth, photosynthetic capacity, leaf biochemistry and reproductive capabilities of the invasive agronomic weed; Lactuca serriola Plant Leaves; Stomatal Conductance; Photosynthesis Global temperatures are predicted to increase by 1.5â€“5.9C during this century, and this change is likely to impact average rainfall, with predictions that water deficit will perhaps be the most severe threat to sustainable agriculture. In this respect, invasive weeds, which have traits better adapted to drought stress than crops, add to concerns regarding crop sustainability. Lactuca serriola, an aggressive agronomic weed is thought to be a successful weed because of its ability to maintain high water use efficiency under drought conditions. In this study, experiments were conducted to examine the influence of different soil moisture regimes (100%, 75%, 50% and 25% water holding capacity (WHC)) on growth, photosynthetic capacity, leaf biochemistry and reproduction of this species. Soil moisture significantly affected plantâ€™s height, stem diameter, number of leaves and biomass. The highest plant height (115.14 cm Â± 11.64), shoot diameter (9.4 mm Â± 0.18), leaf area (1206.5 mm2 Â± 73.29), plant fresh weight (83.1 Â± 3.98) and dry weight (22.38 Â± 1.24) were recorded at 75% soil moisture content. A fundamental adaptation to drought was observed as plants in the 25% WHC treatment had the highest root: shoot ratio. Soluble sugars and total phenolic content were highest in the 25% WHC treatment and significantly different to 100% WHC which was a response to soil moisture stress to ameliorate the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species produced under stress conditions. Results also indicate that L. serriola can survive and produce seeds under water stress as more than 6000 seeds were produced per plant in all WHC treatments. In this study, there was no significant difference in the seed weight, number of seeds produced and their germination ability. This can have a huge impact on agricultural systems as the species can survive both under low and high soil moisture conditions. We therefore suggest that the demonstrated ability of L. serriola to complete its life cycle and produce biomass and seeds under water stressed conditions leads to the introduction of strategies that minimize weed survival while maximizing irrigation efficiency for the crop. A clear understanding of the ecological and biological characteristics of this weed will help land managers take appropriate control measures to mitigate the effect of this species on economic crop productivity."
"An alternative model for evaluating the balance of carrying capacity between functional urban infrastructures Ecological Carrying Capacity; Environmental Protection; Water Resources Urban infrastructures commonly include four types of functional infrastructures: traditional infrastructures, greenspace infrastructures, water infrastructures, and connective infrastructures. They work as an integrated system for supporting sustainable urban development. It is therefore important for having a proper method to help understand whether there is a balance between functional urban infrastructures' carrying capacities (FUICC). This paper introduces an alternative model named FUICC Catastrophe Model (FCM) to evaluate the balance of carrying capacity between various urban infrastructures. The development of the model FCM adopts Mean-Variance Analysis (MVA) technique and Catastrophe Progression Method (CPM) collectively. The application of FCM is demonstrated by using the empirical data collected from 35 cities in China. The research findings suggest that: 1) the difference in carrying capacity of each functional infrastructure between the sample cities is significant; 2) the difference in the degree of balance between FUICC is also significant between the sample cities; 3) the sample cities are classified into four categories, namely, acceptably balanced, less balanced, poorly balanced, and unbalanced. 4) the balance performance between FUICC among Chinese cities is characterized with polarization; 5) the balance performance of carrying capacity between functional urban infrastructures is generally poor in China, 40% of the sample cities achieving acceptable performance."

"Discursive constructions of consumer choice, performance measurement and the marketisation of disability services and aged care in Australia Social Support; Social Care; Direct Payments We show how policy discourses construct consumer choice, performance measurement and quality standards as key technologies in the marketisation of disability services and aged care in Australia. The emergence of performance outcome measurement and increased consumer access to these through diverse consumer facing and interactive platforms enables the state to â€œgovern at a distanceâ€ through the management and shaping of outcome indicators rather than delivery of services. The state does this by creating market competition and establishing outcomes which reflect the construction people using services as informed and rational consumers rather than citizens. This construction and operationalisation frame marketisation as a rational solution to broken systems, assume choice is unproblematic and ignore diverse capacities to access and use information, resource differentials and contextual variables such as market maturity and service availability. The benign marketisation of human services thus discriminates against those who are already marginalised and disadvantaged unless equity strategies are clearly in place."
"How does informal entrepreneurship influence the performance of small formal firms? A cross-country institutional perspective Firm; Bribes; Anti-corruption Measures We advance understanding of how competition from informal entrepreneurial firms influences the performance of small formal (registered) firms. We also investigate the role of tax and law related institutions in shaping differently the performance outcomes of the competition between informal and formal firms. Empirical evidence from the analysis of 11,988 observations in 110 emerging countries indicates that, on average, informal firms affect adversely the performance of small formal firms. These negative effects however are stronger in institutional environments with burdensome courts of law but tend to be weaker in environments with burdensome tax regulations. Our analysis extends the rational exit perspective of informality and shows how competition from informal firms affects the performance of small formal firms. It also specifies how contingencies associated with law- and tax-specific institutions across emerging countries influence this relationship."

"Invertebrate Use of Rooftops in Melbourne Our proposed research will monitor biodiversity impacts of the construction of two new green roof retrofits in Melbourne CBD: the demonstration green roof on 1 Treasury Place and the Melbourne Skyfarm on Siddeley Carpark. These two rooftops represent unique case studies in green roof installation and design considering their spatial context (particularly proximity to large ground-level parks) and design objectives (primarily research and urban agriculture, respectively). We will measure invertebrate diversity, abundance and utilisation on each of these roof sites as well as bare roofs, green roofs and ground sites in the vicinity of each of these new developments, both before and after construction. This provides a unique opportunity to establish and utilise baseline data on roof use by animals to understand questions of habitat use, colonisation, and roof-roof interactions. Surveying the target roofs before the installation of the green infrastructure and collecting information about the species using surrounding roofs after installation will provide detailed information about the additional biodiversity benefits green roofs can deliver in highly urbanised environment. Thus, the findings of our study can be used to better integrate biodiversity and green infrastructure planning."

"Cetacean biodiversity, spatial and temporal trends based on stranding records (1920-2016), Victoria, Australia Bottle-Nosed Dolphin; Cetacea; Stenella Cetacean stranding records can provide vital information on species richness and diversity through space and time. Here we collate stranding records from Victoria, Australia and assess them for temporal, spatial and demographic trends. Between 1920 and 2016, 424 stranding events involving 907 individuals were recorded across 31 Cetacea species from seven families, including five new species records for the state. Seven of these events were mass strandings, and six mother and calf strandings were recorded. Importantly, 48% of the species recorded are recognised as data deficient on the IUCN Red List. The most commonly recorded taxa were Tursiops spp. (n = 146) and Delphinus delphis (common dolphins, n = 81), with the greatest taxonomic richness (n = 24) and highest incidence of stranding events documented within the Otways mesoscale bioregion. We found no seasonal stranding patterns anywhere in the state. While our findings improve understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of cetacean diversity within Victoria, we suggest greater effort to collect demographic data at stranding events in order to better study state-wide patterns through time. We conclude with guidelines for minimum data collection standards for future strandings to maximise information capture from each event."

"The effect of toxicants and microplastics on the health of waterbirds (PhD candidate Damien Nzabanita) Small plastics are major global pollutants, ubiquitous in aquatic and freshwater ecosystems (Peters, 2018). The amount of microplastics (MPs) in the aquatic ecosystem continues to increase and they have been found in different aquatic animals such as fish, penguins and ducks.
Waterbirds suffer due to the number of MPs that build up in their systems. Their morbidity and mortality rates are accelerating faster than in any other bird group, and MPs in the aquatic ecosystem are considered a cause. MPs have many adverse effects on these aquatic animals (Wilcox et al., 2015). According to Verlis et al. , 1013; Wright et al., 2013 and de Sa, 2018, ecotoxicological effects on aquatic animals can be biological, chemical and physical. These adverse effects include: behavioral changes, reproductive impairment, oxidative damage and stress, blockage of the gastrointestinal tract leading to alteration and translocation of the circulatory system, starvation and death.
To date, a few studies in Australia have assessed the presence, abundance and effects of microplastics in aquatic environments. However, not of all them are significant, and these studies have not studied the effects of MPs on the health of waterbirds."
"Emerging investigator series: Phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater by adsorption on steelmaking slag preceding forward osmosis: An integrated process Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption Phosphorus is a critical non-renewable mineral essential for sustainable crop production. However, it is a primary cause of eutrophication in natural water bodies. Hence, a pragmatic approach that allows wastewater treatment plants to efficiently recover phosphorus from wastewater is needed. In this study, we investigated phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater using an industrial waste product (steelmaking slag) as an adsorbent to selectively separate phosphorus from wastewater before its concentration by the forward osmosis (FO) process. Phosphorus adsorbed on slag was extracted, thereby regenerating the adsorbent medium. The resulting phosphorus-rich solution was further enriched by FO prior to chemical precipitation for phosphorus recovery. Batch test results showed that the equilibrium of phosphorus sorption on the slag medium was achieved within 45 min with an adsorption capacity of 3.8 mg g-1. In continuous-flow column tests, the slag exhibited a stable phosphorus removal efficiency of 82% from wastewater, following which approximately 88% of the phosphate could be extracted from the adsorbent medium. When the phosphorus-rich solution extracted from the adsorbent was passed through the FO membrane, FO could retain 98% of the phosphate. However, the water flux through the FO membrane declined gradually to approximately 20% of the initial value at a water recovery of 90%, which could be attributed to the increasingly concentrated feed solution. The enrichment of phosphate in the concentrated feed by the FO process provided a favorable condition for spontaneous precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphate. This study demonstrates that the proposed combined adsorption-FO process can effectively remove, and thus recover, phosphorus from municipal wastewater."
"Renewable thermal energy driven desalination process for a sustainable management of reverse osmosis reject water Distillation; Direct Contact; Membrane A sustainable circular economy involves designing and promoting products with the least environmental impact. This research presents an experimental performance investigation of direct contact membrane distillation with feed approaching supersaturation salinity, which can be useful for the sustainable management of reverse osmosis reject water. Traditionally, reject water from the reverse osmosis systems is discharged in the sea or in the source water body. The reinjection of high salinity reject water into the sea has the potential to put the local sea environment at risk. This paper presents a design of a solar membrane distillation system that can achieve close to zero liquid discharge. The theoretical and experimental analysis on the performance of the lab scale close to zero liquid discharge system that produces supersaturated brine is studied. The lab-based experiments were conducted at boundary conditions, which were close to the real-world conditions where feed water temperatures ranged between 40â—¦C and 85â—¦C and the permeate water temperatures ranged between 5â—¦C and 20â—¦C. The feed water was supplied at salinity between 70,000 ppm to 110,000 ppm, similar to reject from reverse osmosis. The experimental results show that the maximum flux of 17.03 kg/m2Â·h was achieved at a feed temperature of 80â—¦C, a feed salinity of 10,000 ppm, a permeate temperature of 5â—¦C and at constant feed and a permeate flow rate of 4 L/min. Whereas for the same conditions, the theoretical mass flux was 18.23 kg/m2Â·h. Crystal formation was observed in the feed tank as the feed water volume reduced and the salinity increased, reaching close to 308,000 ppm TDS. At this condition, the mass flux approached close to zero due to crystallisation on the membrane surface. This study provides advice on the practical limitations for the use of membrane distillation to achieve close to zero liquid discharge."

"Leaching of transition metal from spent Li-ion batteries (scholarship top-up Rakibul Qadir) Lithium-ion battery (LIB) in electronics and electric vehicles have been growing rapidly, resulting in boosting resources demand. In light of the significant quantity, potential environmental concern, high content of valuable resources, and limit carrying capacity of global reserves, the recycling of spent LIBs is highly desirable. Currently the overall recycling rate of Fe, Cu, AL, Co, Ni, and Mn are over 50%, and
the recycling rate of Li is less than 1%. These also reveal that the current recycling rate of the spent LIBs is still low and it is of need to develop the comprehensive and high-efficient process in the near future.

"Modelling current and future abundances of benthic invertebrates using bathymetric LiDAR and oceanographic variables Paracentrotus; Sea Urchins; Gonads A key requirement for managing commercial fisheries is understanding the geographic footprint of the resource, the level of exploitation and the potential impacts of changing climate or habitat conditions. The development of spatially explicit predictive models of species distributions combined with predictions of changing oceanographic conditions provides the opportunity to obtain new insights of species-habitat associations. Here, generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to model the abundance of two commercially important marine macro-invertebrates, blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra and long-spined sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii, along the coast of Victoria, Australia. We combined abundance data from fisheries independent diver surveys with environmental variables derived from bathymetric light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and oceanographic parameters derived from satellite imagery. The GLM was used to predict species responses to environmental gradients where reef complexity, sea surface temperature (SST) and depth were strongly associated with species distributions. The abundance of H. rubra declined with increasing summer SST. In comparison, the abundance of C. rodgersii increased with increasing winter SST. The GLM showed that the projected increase in ocean temperatures will likely lead to a decline in abundance across the H. rubra fishery. Conversely, a range expansion of C. rodgersii is likely due to the strengthening of the East Australian Current. For species that exhibit a high affinity to specific seascape features, this research demonstrated how recent advances in seabed mapping can allow the identification of areas with high conservation or fisheries value at a fine-scale relevant to resource exploitation across large geographic regions."

"Design of Peptide-Based Nanovaccines Targeting Leading Antigens From Gynecological Cancers to Induce HLA-A2.1 Restricted CD8+ T Cell Responses Antigen; Immunotherapy; Dendritic Cells Gynecological cancers are a leading cause of mortality in women. CD8+ T cell immunity largely correlates with enhanced survival, whereas inflammation is associated with poor prognosis. Previous studies have shown polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs) are biocompatible, do not induce inflammation and when used as vaccine carriers for model peptides induce CD8+ T cell responses. Herein we test the immunogenicity of 24 different peptides, from three leading vaccine target proteins in gynecological cancers: the E7 protein of human papilloma virus (HPV); Wilms Tumor antigen 1 (WT1) and survivin (SV), in PSNP conjugate vaccines. Of relevance to vaccine development was the finding that a minimal CD8+ T cell peptide epitope from HPV was not able to induce HLA-A2.1 specific CD8+ T cell responses in transgenic humanized mice using conventional adjuvants such as CpG, but was nevertheless able to generate strong immunity when delivered as part of a specific longer peptide conjugated to PSNPs vaccines. Conversely, in most cases, when the minimal CD8+ T cell epitopes were able to induce immune responses (with WT1 or SV super agonists) in CpG, they also induced responses when conjugated to PSNPs. In this case, extending the sequence around the CD8+ T cell epitope, using the natural protein context, or engineering linker sequences proposed to enhance antigen processing, had minimal effects in enhancing or changing the cross-reactivity pattern induced by the super agonists. Nanoparticle approaches, such as PSNPs, therefore may offer an alternative vaccination strategy when conventional adjuvants are unable to elicit the desired CD8+ T cell specificity. The findings herein also offer sequence specific insights into peptide vaccine design for nanoparticle-based vaccine carriers."
"Examining the effect of time constraint on the online mastery learning approach towards improving postgraduate students' achievement Formative Assessment; Written Feedback; Literacy Time control plays a critical role within the online mastery learning (OML) approach. This paper examines the two commonly implemented mastery learning strategiesâ€“personalised system of instructions and learning for mastery (LFM)â€“by focusing on what occurs when there is an instructional time constraint. Using a large data set from a postgraduate finance course offered at an Australian university, we explore students' online quiz-completion patterns, then empirically investigate whether the imposition of an instructional time constraint in the OML approach has an impact on their final-examination performance. Our results suggest that the LFM strategy with an instructional time constraint has a positive impact on students' learning behaviour and contributes to better overall academic performance. Further, our findings suggest that facilitators should be encouraged to implement an instructional time constraint when adopting an OML approach."
"Relevant phenotypic descriptors of the resonance Norway spruce standing trees for the acoustical quality of wood for musical instruments Elastic Modulus; Lumber; Fiber Saturation Identifying high-grade valuable wood resources by the visible individual traits of trees is a challenge for foresters and a requirement for sustainable resource management. The aim of this study was to identify the most relevant phenotypic descriptors of the acoustic quality of Norway spruce standing timber. Two highly valuable Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands located in the Romanian Carpathians were selected for this purpose. A total of 27 tree, bole, bark, and crown variables and nine variables related to wood structure were statistically checked against the velocities of stress waves measured on standing trees at breast height, and the derived parameters: the radiation, the impedance, and the moduli of elasticity in L and R directions. Principal component analysis was used for exploratory data analysis as well as mixed linear models were involved in explaining these acoustics. There were consistent variations in the measured acoustics from tree to tree, according to the age and social class. Wood acoustical parameters measured in the R direction are better predicted by tree phenotype than the acoustical parameters measured in the L direction. Bark thickness and branch width were the best predictors, while tree ring features were less predictive. At a given age, trees with high velocity had thinner and reddisher bark, thinner branches, and a narrower crown. Trees with high velocity anisotropy had narrower branches and wider sapwood. Furthermore, the phenotypic traits used had a poor explanatory power of the radiation ratio. In conclusion, spruce standing trees from the studied area bring forward certain outside features that enable us the multitrait identification of highly valuable wood for string instruments."

"Investigating the influence of question type and cognitive process on academic performance in VCE Physical Education: a secondary data analysis Sports; School Sports; Figurational Sociology External written examinations are commonly used for determining student academic achievement. The influence of question type and cognitive process on examination performance in senior-secondary physical education is unclear. A secondary data analysis of Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) Physical Education examination data (2011; n = 9,323, 2012; n = 8,781) was conducted. Question type (multiple choice and short answer) and overall examination performance were compared and the predictive value of question type, cognitive process (based on Bloomâ€™s revised taxonomy), and overall examination scores determined. In 2011 and 2012, students performed significantly better on multiple-choice questions; however, short-answer performance better predicted overall exam performance. A significant difference between marks achieved by cognitive level and grade (Ungraded [UG]â€“A+) was found. Low-achieving students (UGâ€“D) were performing well below the examination mean across all questions. Developing higher order thinking skills for all students may lead to improved overall examination performance in VCE Physical Education."
"Malawian children with uncomplicated and cerebral malaria have decreased activated Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cells which increase in convalescence Cerebral Malaria; Animals; Hemozoin Malaria is responsible for almost half a million deaths annually. The role of VÎ³9VÎ´2 Î³Î´ T cells in malaria is still unclear. Studies have reported an association between this cell subset and malaria symptoms and severity. Profiles of VÎ³9VÎ´2 Î³Î´ T cells in bigger cohorts with different levels of clinical severity have not been described. Proportion, numbers, and activation status of VÎ³9VÎ´2 Î³Î´ T cells were measured by flow cytometry in 59 healthy controls (HCs), 58 children with uncomplicated malaria (UM) and 67 with cerebral malaria (CM,) during acute malaria and in convalescence 28 days later. VÎ³9VÎ´2 Î³Î´ T cell were lower in children presenting with UM and CM than in HCs. Cell counts did not vary with malaria severity (CM median counts 40 x 103 cells/Î¼L, IQR [23â€“103]; UM median counts 30 x 103 cells/Î¼L [10â€“90], P = 0.224). VÎ³9VÎ´2 Î³Î´ T cell counts increased during convalescence for UM (70 [40â€“60] x 103 cells/Î¼L and CM (90 [60â€“140] x 103 cells/Î¼L), to levels similar to those in HCs (70 [50â€“140] x 103 cells/Î¼L), p = 0.70 and p = 0.40 respectively. Expression of the activation markers CD69 and HLA-DR on VÎ³9VÎ´2 Î³Î´ T cells was higher in malaria cases than in controls (HCs vs UM or CM, p < 0.0001) but was similar between UM and CM. HLA-DR expression remained elevated at 28 days, suggesting sustained activation of VÎ³9VÎ´2 Î³Î´ T cells during recovery. VÎ³9VÎ´2 Î³Î´ T cell proportions and cells counts were suppressed in acute disease and normalized in convalescence, a phenomenon previously hypothesized to be due to transient migration of the cells to secondary lymphoid tissue. The presence of highly activated VÎ³9VÎ´2 Î³Î´ T cells suggests that this T cell subset plays a specific role in response to malaria infection."

"Assessment Design for Interdisciplinary, Professional and Sustainability Education Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development This paper offers a situated micro-analysis of a major undergraduate assessment task within Sustainability Education, which exemplifies earlier work on the Higher Education Learning Design framework (HELD) as discussed in Holdsworth and Hegarty (J Clean Prod 122:176â€“185, 2016) and Hegarty and Holdsworth (Environ Dev Sustain 17:239â€“258, 2015). This assessment task, undertaken by students in multiple baccalaureate programs whose professional terrain is directly connectedâ€”that of construction managers, building developers and the urban planners who evaluate and approve development proposals in municipal and consultancy contexts. This paper presents the rationale for the assessment inception and design in the context of various imperatives. It also explores the situated experience of delivery of this assessment and our own reflection on the management of a complex assessment task. Student perspectives from the courses are also shared, drawing on external research undertaken on the learning and teaching experiences within both courses when the assessment was first implemented. Useful lessons for integrated, student-centred learning design, as proposed by the HELD model, are highlighted from this micro-analysis."

"Adoption of social sustainability practices in an emerging economy: Insights from Vietnamese handicraft organizations Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices With globalization of supply chains, adopting social sustainability practices (SSP) has become critical to improving sustainable development of organizations in emerging economies producing and exporting goods to developed countries. Yet, comprehensive research on SSP adoption by these companies, such as the handicraft organizations in Vietnam, is scarce. To supplement the inadequacy, this study takes an integrated supply chain perspective to examine holistically the critical factors affecting SSP adoption by Vietnamese handicraft organizations. Data were collected from a countrywide survey of 310 handicraft organizations with SSP adoption in Vietnam. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to test the hypotheses. The findings reveal that organizational behavior and readiness impact directly on SSP adoption, whereas stakeholder pressures show some indirect impacts. The results also validate the mediating roles of organizational behavior and readiness in the adoption of SSP. By combining the technology-organization-environment framework with the institutional theory, this study successfully explains the diverse SSP adoption behaviors in Vietnamese handicraft organizations. It is the first attempt to explore the critical role of internationalization readiness in SSP adoption in the Vietnamese context. The research outcomes provide insights and references for sustainability practitioners and policymakers to promote SSP adoption that extends across the entire supply chain."

"The sociology of compensation inequality in upper-echelon positions: evidence from Australia Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence This paper explores the sociology of gender pay equality in leadership positions. Using a large compensation dataset, we examine the impact of gender pay inequality among directors and executives on firm performance. Based on a triangulation research design, quantitative outcomes are supplemented with semi-structured interviews to study compensation expectations, negotiation skills and gender differences in teamwork on boards of directors. The findings show that remuneration transparency is becoming the norm. However, compensation inequalities still exist and undermine performance. The results indicate that diversity targets or specific policies regarding equality and equity of opportunity are insufficient if they are not supported by a cultural understanding and the application of equitable policies and procedures throughout the organisation."

"Catalytic degradation of methylene blue using iron and nitrogen-containing carbon dots as Fenton-like catalysts Fluorescence; Nanodots; Carbon Nanoparticles Wastewater pollution is an existing and serious environmental issue. One of the main wastewater pollution sources is from the dyestuff industries and its discharge poses a serious threat to the ecosystem due to its adverse effects on human and environmental health. Conventional wastewater treatments are limited in terms of effectively treating such non-biodegradable contaminants; thus, this work aimed to investigate the degradation of the commercial dye methylene blue (MB)viaadvanced oxidation processes (AOPs) using carbon dots as Fenton-like catalysts. Iron and nitrogen-containing carbon dots (Fe, N-CDs) were synthesised through a hydrothermal reaction and utilised as catalysts in the degradation of MB. Multiple characterisation techniques were employed to describe the dot properties including FTIR, XPS, TEM,Î¶-potential, PL and UV-Vis analyses. Characterisation revealed the synthesis of 7 nm diameter, spherical negatively charged dots rich in iron and nitrogen surface functionalities. Methylene blue was degraded under mild conditions using an innovative green remediation technology which removed nearly 100% of the dye (20 mg Lâˆ’1) under optimised conditions (at 50 Â°C, pH 8, H2O2147 mM, and a catalyst concentration of 0.5 mg mLâˆ’1) in only 60 minutes. The active mechanism of the Fe, N-CDs was deduced suggesting the participation of free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygens and holes. Importantly, the effluent toxicity assessed using MicrotoxÂ® confirmed the generation of a non-toxic effluent. This investigation showed that using Fe, N-CDs is an effective way to degrade wastewater pollution whilst significantly minimising its toxicity."

"Laboratory evaluation of PAH and VOC emission from plastic-modified asphalt Scrap Tires; Rubber; Rubber Waste Recycled plastic modified asphalt is an emerging topic in the road construction industry that has been studied meticulously from a physical and mechanical perspective. However, the exposure of recycled plastics to high temperatures has been a growing concern due to the possible release of toxic gases associated with burning plastics. This research investigates laboratory-generated fumes from recycled plastic modified asphalt incorporated via two different methods using four types of recycled plastic from post-industrial and post-consumer streams. Results were compared against conventional asphalt prepared using neat bitumen or commercial polymer-modified bitumen. A direct liquid injection method using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed to quantify 48 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Results revealed that the incorporation of recycled plastics could effectively reduce (up to 34% VOCs and 51% PAHs) overall emissions at all working temperatures except when recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene was mixed at 180 Â°C. Further tests involving sorption analysis of plastics revealed that plastics have an adsorbent capability with a selectivity towards PAHs (compared to VOCs) and therefore further justifying that the addition of recycled plastics in asphalt can effectively limit the total emitted compounds."

"Leveraging joint distribution in urban express delivery to lessen environmental impacts: a case study Freight Transport; City Logistics; Cargo Purpose: This paper aims to explore the use of joint distribution to reduce environmental cost of express delivery in urban logistics. Design/methodology/approach: An optimization model was developed to help design the joint distribution network. A real case in Songjiang University Town of Shanghai, China, was used to explore empirically the potential benefit of the design. Performance of the proposed joint distribution was compared with that of the current distribution design using separate deliveries. Findings: The findings show that, using joint distribution in express delivery, a significant saving in economic cost (up to a reduction of 25%) and environmental cost (up to a reduction of 87%) can be achieved. Research limitations/implications: This study provides a reference for joint distribution network design for last-mile delivery in urban logistics. Practical implications: Express delivery companies can explore the use of joint distribution to reduce operating cost and increase distribution efficiency of the industry. Social implications: Joint distribution can facilitate maximization of vehicle utilization and reduction of delivery trips. This will help reduce fuel consumption, carbon emission, as well as other externalities, such as noise and traffic congestion. Originality/value: Research in joint distribution to date focuses mainly on reduction in operating cost only. Consideration of environmental impact is relatively limited. This paper fills the gap in the literature by using a real case to illustrate the significant benefit of joint distribution in reducing the negative impact of urban logistics on the environment."

"Tumor growth inhibition by mSTEAP peptide nanovaccine inducing augmented CD8+ T cell immune responses Antigen; Immunotherapy; Dendritic Cells Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) has been successfully used in drug delivery and biomaterial applications, but very little attention has been directed towards the potential in vivo effects of peptide-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (NPs), specifically the potency of intravenous (IV) STEAP peptide-loaded PLGA-NP (nanovaccine) dosing and whether STEAP-specific CD8+ T cells directly play a key role in tumor inhibition. To address these concerns, syngeneic prostate cancer mouse models were established and treated with either mSTEAP peptide emulsified in incomplete Freundâ€™s adjuvant (IFA) via subcutaneous (SC) injection or mSTEAP peptide nanovaccine containing the same amount of peptide via IV or SC injection. Meanwhile, mice were treated with either CD8b mAb followed by nanovaccine treatment, free mSTEAP peptide, or empty PLGA-NPs. Immune responses in these mice were examined using cytotoxicity assays at 14 days after treatment. Tumor size and survival in various treatment groups were measured and monitored. The results demonstrated that mSTEAP peptide nanovaccine resulted in tumor inhibition by eliciting a significantly stronger CD8+ T cell immune response when compared with the controls. Moreover, the survival periods of mice treated with mSTEAP nanovaccine were significantly longer than those of mice treated with mSTEAP peptide emulsified in IFA or the treatment controls. Additionally, it was observed that the peptide nanovaccine was mainly distributed in the mouse liver and lungs after IV injection. These findings suggest that the peptide nanovaccine is a promising immunotherapeutic approach and offers a new opportunity for prostate cancer therapies."

"Lipidomic profiling reveals early-stage metabolic dysfunction in overweight or obese humans Ceramides; Insulin Resistance; Ganglioside GM3 Background: Advances in mass spectrometry and lipidomics techniques are providing new insights into the role of lipid metabolism in obesity-related diseases. However, human lipidomic studies have been inconsistent, owing to the use of indirect proxy measures of metabolic outcomes and relatively limited coverage of the lipidome. Here, we employed comprehensive lipid profiling and gold-standard metabolic measures to test the hypothesis that distinct lipid signatures in obesity may signify early stages of pathogenesis toward type 2 diabetes. Methods: Using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, we profiled >450 lipid species across 26 classes in 65 overweight or obese non-diabetic individuals. Intensive metabolic testing was conducted using direct gold-standard measures of adiposity (% body fat by dual X-ray absorptiometry), insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps), and insulin secretion (intravenous glucose tolerance tests), as well as measurement of serum inflammatory cytokines and adipokines (multiplex assays; flow cytometry). Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were computed using Matlab R2011a, and all analyses were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Results: We present new evidence showing a strong and independent positive correlation between the lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) lipid class and insulin secretion in vivo in humans (Î² [95% CI] = 781.9 [353.3, 1210.4], p = 0.01), supporting the insulinotropic effects of LPI demonstrated in mouse islets. Dihydroceramide, a sphingolipid precursor, was independently and negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity (Î² [95% CI] = âˆ’1.9 [âˆ’2.9, âˆ’0.9], p = 0.01), indicating a possible upregulation in sphingolipid synthesis in obese individuals. These associations remained significant in multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, and % body fat. The dihexosylceramide class correlated positively with interleukin-10 before and after adjustment for age, sex, and % body fat (p = 0.02), while the phosphatidylethanolamine class and its vinyl ether-linked (plasmalogen) derivatives correlated negatively with % body fat in both univariable and age- and sex-adjusted models (all p < 0.04). Conclusions: Our data suggest that these lipid classes may signify early pathogenesis toward type 2 diabetes and could serve as novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers for diabetes prevention."

"Opportunities for Growth: Australia and Viet Nam Australia's economicengagement with Viet Nam lags that of its Asian neighbours. in 2018, Viet Nam was  Australia's 15th largesttrading partner, ranking behind Hong Kong, Taiwan and Indonesia. Viet Nam's rapid  growth over the last few decades offers tremendous opportunities. in the third quarter of 2019, Viet Nam recorded 7 per cent growth. Australia's two-way trade with Viet Nam is forecast to grow at almost 11% over the next 5 years, second only to India.
The governments of both countries have recognised this potential and established a strategic partnership to deepen the relationship.Akey priority is developing an Enhanced Economic Engagement Strategy with the goal of becoming top ten trade partners and doubling investment. The Prime Ministers of both countries expressed support forfacilrtating agricultural market access and collaboration on energy security and digital opportunities.
To achieve these overarching goals, businesses on the ground need access to timely information on the products, services and sectors that offer the most viable opportunities. Interested entrants need market intelligence to allow them to make an informed judgement on how best to enter the market. Operating in a foreign market also requires an understanding of local challenges, non-tariff barriers and ways to address them. There is a need for research to identify the specific barriers that Australian businesses face in Viet Nam, provide case studies of successful ventures, share best practice and recommend policy reforms.
The Asia Society and Australian APEC Study Centre at RMIT University are jointly developing a business-friendly research report to further enhance engagement with Viet Nam."

"Survey of Long-tailed macaque's Behaviour in Mount Rinjani National Park, Lombok Timur Pan Troglodytes; Primates; Grooming The research was conducted in Mount Rinjani National Park, Lombok Timur, to observe the daily activities of Long-tailed macaque in utilizing their habitat and vocalization analysis as a hallmark of species. The Long-tailed macaque' activities were analyzed using the scan sampling method. Ten (10) individuals of Long-tailed macaque were observed. The results showed that the observed activities of Long-tailed macaque were feeding, sleeping, inactive, grooming, mating, moving, excretion, playing, making sound, and agonistic (fighting). The average percentage of Long-tailed macaque observed was feeding (10.1%), sleeping (9%), inactive (9.4%), grooming (14.9%), mating (8.5%), moving (11.1%), excretion (7.9%), playing (9.7%), making sound (9.5%), and agonistic (9.9%). The daily activities can be as a reference in detecting the 'species' of the Long-tailed macaque. To support the population of this species, especially for long-term survival, the manager of the Rinjani Nasional Park should preserve the forest with conservation of natural forests and wildlife or biodiversity conservation and ecotourism, also prevent littering and illegal activities."
"Suitability Assessment of Marble, Glass Powders and Poly-Propylene Fibers for Improvement of Siwalik Clay Compressive Strength; Atterberg Limit; Polypropylene Fiber Raising of the Mangla Dam in Pakistan submerged about 15,780 acres of land, resulting in the relocation of 8020 inhabitants to a newly developed town named New City. The new site, consisting of 1300 acres, is in the sub-tropical zone and comprises badland topography. The parent soils (Siwalik clay) pose infrastructure serviceability issues, causing immense loss to property. The study aims to improve the properties of Siwalik clay (base soil) using industrial wastes like marble and glass powders (5 to 20%) and polypropylene fibers (0.25 to 1.25%) as modifiers. Laboratory tests including grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, standard Proctor compaction, unconfined compression, indirect tensile strength, swell potential, and California bearing ratio were conducted on the control and modified clay samples. The results showed that unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and swelling strains (SS) were increased by 43% and 8% at 1.57 kPa pressure with 15% replacement of marble powder. However, the addition of the 20% glass powder and 0.5% polypropylene fibers not only improved UCS by 110% and 39%, but also reduced SS by 27% and 86%, respectively. The capital construction cost of 1 km long road with modified subgrade using 15% glass powder was reduced by 16% whereas it increased for marble powder and polypropylene fibers by 22% and 17%, respectively. All modifiers had very low hazard to adjoining aqueous environment. Conclusively, glass powder and polypropylene fibers can be used as environmentally-friendly soil improvement modifiers, leading towards sustainable solutions of the serviceability problems."
"How mental health care should change as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic Psychological Support; Mindfulness; COVID-19 The unpredictability and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic; the associated lockdowns, physical distancing, and other containment strategies; and the resulting economic breakdown could increase the risk of mental health problems and exacerbate health inequalities. Preliminary findings suggest adverse mental health effects in previously healthy people and especially in people with pre-existing mental health disorders. Despite the heterogeneity of worldwide health systems, efforts have been made to adapt the delivery of mental health care to the demands of COVID-19. Mental health concerns have been addressed via the public mental health response and by adapting mental health services, mostly focusing on infection control, modifying access to diagnosis and treatment, ensuring continuity of care for mental health service users, and paying attention to new cases of mental ill health and populations at high risk of mental health problems. Sustainable adaptations of delivery systems for mental health care should be developed by experts, clinicians, and service users, and should be specifically designed to mitigate disparities in health-care provision. Thorough and continuous assessment of health and service-use outcomes in mental health clinical practice will be crucial for defining which practices should be further developed and which discontinued. For this Position Paper, an international group of clinicians, mental health experts, and users of mental health services has come together to reflect on the challenges for mental health that COVID-19 poses. The interconnectedness of the world made society vulnerable to this infection, but it also provides the infrastructure to address previous system failings by disseminating good practices that can result in sustained, efficient, and equitable delivery of mental health-care delivery. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic could be an opportunity to improve mental health services."

"Public service media, innovation policy and the ‘crowding out’ problem Public Service Broadcasting; Broadcasters; Public Television Public service media organisations manage the challenges they face as they transition to a converged environment by innovating in the areas of distribution, programming, and engagement. Many commercial media companies critique public service innovation and argue that it is â€˜crowding outâ€™ the private market. Focusing on public service media organisations in Germany and Australia, this article examines the relationship between innovation, regulation and resilience. We argue that while the Australian model of innovation performs a vital role for the domestic media industry, it does not always contribute to the long-term resilience of individual innovations brought out by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Conversely, while innovation is hamstrung by layers of bureaucracy in Germany, once innovations developed by Second German Television are legally approved, they operate in a relatively uncontested manner. To explain the findings, we propose a comparative framework consisting of four factors: size, public/private divide, regulatory frameworks and legal traditions."

"Designing a demand chain management framework under dynamic uncertainty: An exploratory study of the Chinese fashion apparel industry Agile Manufacturing; Organizational Agility; Agility Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to put forward a demand chain management (DCM) framework underpinned by the alignment theory and applies it to investigate the fashion apparel (FA) industry in China under the impacts of the latest economic transition. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory multiple case study methodology involving five Chinese FA firms, each with a different business model and ownership type, was employed. Semi-structured interviews, onsite observations and review of company documents were conducted to collect information for analysis. Findings: Using a conceptual DCM framework as a guide for analysis, the study finds that companies with a higher level of alignment with the external market situation and among the three internal DCM dimensions, namely, market management, supply chain management (SCM), and organization management, appear to perform better under the rapidly changing economic conditions in China. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to knowledge by reviewing thoroughly the literature on SCM evolution and develops a DCM framework based on alignment theory that represents the state of the art in this area. By extending the administration-integration-production-development (A-I-P-D) logic set adopted in the alignment theory, this study has also equipped the proposed framework with an empirical tool to measure alignment. Practical implications: By applying the framework to examine the Chinese apparel industry under the impacts of the latest economic transition, this study provides practitioners in the industry with a framework to help formulate strategies and a tool to measure alignment. The findings of the case study also offer insights to the industry to thrive in the rapidly changing businesses environment with dynamic uncertainties. Originality/value: This study extends the application of the A-I-P-D logic set under the alignment theory to the SCM field. This endeavor successfully transforms the proposed DCM framework from a theoretical concept to a practical tool to help evaluate empirically the alignment and strategic fit of a firm and potential relationship with firm performance. As the Chinese FA market has increasingly evolved under the impact of the globalization, the findings of this study not only assist the local FA companies in coping with the dynamic uncertainties but also shed light on the future developments of the global FA industry. Besides, the alignment measurement tool embedded in the proposed DCM framework can help enhance the chances of business success during implementation."

"Diamond scanning probe for characterization of topological insulators As a new state of matter, Topological Insulators (TI) with insulating bulk but conducting surface states are recognized as the key for the implementation of low power consumption devices for high‐performance and low power electronics, and quantum computing. To identify the full potential of TI materials, characterization and modelling of TI are needed. In this project, we will develop a full optical method to
characterize TI. Our approach takes advantage of scanning quantum probe type technology. Because of the unique electromagnetic boundary conditions of Tl relate the electric and magnetic fields at the surface of the TI, we monitor the change in far‐field fluorescence from a single dipole as a function of the type of material: conductor vs insulator vs TI. The interference is due to interactions between the dipole and the effective mirror dipole inside and outside the material. We propose to use diamond pillars or nanodiamonds with single color centers, initially concentrating on the nitrogen‐vacancy (NV) color center, to develop a robust scanning optical tool to characterize and identify TI. This technique has the potential of being fast and able to scan wide areas (typically hundreds of microns) with spatial resolution around the tens to hundred nanometer level. Another useful readout information of our method to characterize TI will use the magnetic sensing capability of NV centers to characterize the magnetic field response of TI to electric fields, since a magnetic field arises when an electric field is applied near the surface due to the special electromagnetic boundary properties of Tl. Our proposed method, based on novel electromagnetic modelling and scanning diamond probe technology, promises new insights into the characterization and optimization of materials for TI‐based devices.

"Child protection and family group conferencing curriculum for social workers in Palestine First International; Indigenization; Family Preservation This article describes a United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund project to develop a child protection curriculum in social work schools in Palestine conducted over 2016, 2017 and 2018. The curriculum was delivered in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as to a delegation from Palestine in Melbourne. The article discusses the challenges and highlights in introducing a rights and strength-based, child-focused, family-inclusive, and trauma-informed child protection curriculum in the context of occupation, poverty and patriarchy. It emphasises the need for critical reflection for foreign educators in relation to culture, gender, human rights and anti-oppressive practices when teaching in the Middle East and other collective cultures. The key outcomes were new collaborations between Palestinian academics from Gaza and the West Bank, as well as their preference for family group conferencing over traditional Western case management models of child protection to promote peaceful, inclusive societies."

In this paper we identify and discuss the much vaunted and highly desirable â€˜21st century skillsâ€™ learnt in youth arts settings. Drawing on arguments first advanced by Dick Hebdidge and Raymond Williams, we show that while 21st century skills are learnt through affect, the processes through which this learning proceeds produces skills that are seen as valuable commodities. Taking the everyday seriously as a site for learning, we explore youth arts projects as a site for skills development and argue for a framing of micro-credentials that at once recognizes and problematizes this modality of training. We do so by outlining how our reading of cultural studies scholarship can provide a foundation for understanding the everyday spaces of youth arts as critical sites of knowledge production. Examining the intersections of identity, being and culture as pedagogical, we outline how the everyday experiences of diverse youth participating in arts might be captured so as to build pathways into the future based on competency in â€˜the nowâ€™."

"Thinking Inside the Box: A Closer Look at Financial Inclusion and Household Income Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion Using national representative household finance survey data covering more than 6200 Chinese households, we first construct a new multidimensional indicator for financial inclusion. Then we examine the effect of financial inclusion on household income. Our results elicit several findings. First, financial inclusion has a strong positive effect on household income. This effect can be found across all households with different levels of income. Second, low-income households are found to benefit more from financial inclusion than high and mid-level income ones. We argue that, in this sense, financial inclusion helps reduce income inequality."

"Latin American Migrants in Australia: A Systematic Review of the Data and Literature Transnationalism; Human Migration; Dual Citizenship Australiaâ€™s rapidly growing Latin American community is attracting increasing scholarly interest. This article builds a statistical and thematic profile of what we know from the scholarship about Latin Americans in Australia, and identifies key areas requiring further attention. Two methods were employed: (1) the first systematic review of the literature published to date on Latin American people in Australia; (2) a quantitative study of Latin Americans in Australia, using data extracted from the Australian Census 2016, and immigration information from 2016 to December 2019. Both focused on the question: â€œWhat do we know about the characteristics and adaptations of Latin American migrants in Australia, and what remains to be researched?â€ While there is considerable literature, many areas have been neglected. The most significant gaps are in the areas of political engagement; health and wellbeing (especially for children, men, and students); student experiences and pathways; gender; and trade and economics."

"Targeting central inflammation to combat obesity and obesity-related cognitive dysfunction he current obesity epidemic means many of us will suffer from overweight or obesity for at least some of our lives. My findings show obesity can cause inflammation throughout the brain including in regions related to learning and memory. Here I hypothesize that obesity induces long-term changes in the brain?s immune cells, that this can explain why we see susceptibility to cognitive decline in obese individuals, and that we can reverse these negative effects by targeting these immune cells."

"Increasing Use of Human-Dominated Habitats as CO2 Emissions Warm and Acidify Oceans Biodiversity; Patellogastropoda; Intertidal Community Urban and artificial structures are increasingly added to the worldâ€™s coasts during a time in which changing climate is forecast to drive shifts in naturally occurring habitats. We ask whether the role of artificial structures as marine habitats will increase in importance relative to their natural counterparts, particularly as natural habitats are negatively affected by ocean warming and acidification. To evaluate this model, we contrasted use of natural (kelp forest and turfing algae) and artificial habitat (plastic pier-piling) by a nest-building amphipod (Cymadusa pemptos) under current and future climate conditions of CO2 and temperature. Under future conditions, amphipod populations in mesocosms increased, but this did not lead to greater proportional colonization of kelp and turf. Instead, colonization doubled in artificial habitats, and there was increasing production and occupation of nests on artificial habitats relative to natural habitats. In an age when human modification of natural substrata is increasingly cited as an agent of wildlife decline, understanding the future role of artificial habitats as replacement dwellings for natural habitats is critical. We pioneer an understanding of the future role of natural and artificial habitats, identifying the possibility that the role of urban structures as marine habitats may only increase."

"Distributed participatory design in crowdsourced information systems development Scrum; Agile Software Development; Project Management Distributed participatory design (DPD) is an approach to information systems development (ISD) where different stakeholders participate in the development and design of information systems in distributed design teams which are mostly online on Internet, web-based, and social media platforms. User participation in online DPD projects is primarily voluntary and the participants are typically unaffiliated with the development organisation. Going beyond individual methods, techniques, and practices and to extend research on participatory approaches to ISD beyond conventional settings, roles and types of participants, we are interested in how DPD projects in crowdsourced ISD are managed and performed in their entirety. To answer this research question we studied a case of DPD in crowdsourced ISD in the context of a DPD project which engaged Pacific Youth in the development of a digital game. As contemporary ISD is generally acknowledged as a complex activity we apply complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory to better understand and make recommendations for ISD practice."

"A review of the current in-situ fouling control strategies in MBR: Biological versus physicochemical Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling Fouling in membrane bioreactors (MBR) is a bottleneck problem limiting their application. In-situ fouling control strategies have been continuously developed for decades, and can be mainly categorized as biological and physicochemical approaches. However, the mechanisms and performance of these methods as well as their application prospects have not been thoroughly discussed and compared in a systematic manner. This study was aimed at providing a detailed review on the various in-situ biological and physicochemical methods in terms of fouling control performance, fouling reduction mechanisms and practicability. This involves a comparison of the popular biological control strategies including quorum quenching (QQ)) and physicochemical approaches such as NaClO backflushing, hybrid electrochemical MBR and anti-biofouling membrane development, with the analysis of their potential, existing issues and practicality in full-scale applications. Future work is also recommended for developing more sustainable and more widely applicable MBR fouling control strategies."
"Microwave hydrothermal carbonization of rice straw: Optimization of process parameters and upgrading of chemical, fuel, structural and thermal properties Hydrothermal Carbonization; Hydrochars; Carbon The process parameters of microwave-induced hydrothermal carbonization (MIHTC) play an important role on the hydrothermal chars (hydrochar) yield. The effect of reaction temperature, reaction time, particle size and biomass to water ratio was optimized for hydrochar yield by modeling using the central composite design (CCD). Further, the rice straw and hydrochar at optimum conditions have been characterized for energy, chemical, structural and thermal properties. The optimum condition for hydrochar synthesis was found to be at a 180 Â°C reaction temperature, a 20 min reaction time, a 1:15 weight per volume (w/v) biomass to water ratio and a 3 mm particle size, yielding 57.9% of hydrochar. The higher heating value (HHV), carbon content and fixed carbon values increased from 12.3 MJ/kg, 37.19% and 14.37% for rice straw to 17.6 MJ/kg, 48.8% and 35.4% for hydrochar. The porosity, crystallinity and thermal stability of the hydrochar were improved remarkably compared to rice straw after MIHTC. Two characteristic peaks from XRD were observed at 2Î¸ of 15Â° and 26Â°, whereas DTG peaks were observed at 50-150 Â°C and 300-350 Â°C for both the materials. Based on the results, it can be suggested that the hydrochar could be potentially used for adsorption, carbon sequestration, energy and agriculture applications."
"Young precariat and a new work order? A case for historical sociology Student Mobility; International Students; Youth Labour Market This article assesses Guy Standing's (2011) account of â€˜the precariatâ€™ as a â€˜new class' to the many exercises undertaken in youth studies since the 1980s to make sense of the changing patterns of youth employment. While Standing's focus on the experience of fragmented and casualized work in many economies which now implicates young people has value, there are significant problems with his account that highlights the some difficulties in thinking in somewhat abstracted ways about â€˜structuralâ€™ change processes that do not sufficiently consider the question of time. The case of Australia's of labour market regulation since the 1890s is used to test the validity of Standing's focus on the novelty of neoliberalism after the early 1980 to explain the emergence of precarious employment. Standing's claim that insecurity is central to the â€˜new precariatâ€™ because they lack the different kinds of security enjoyed by the â€˜working-classâ€™ after 1945, highlights the need for an interpretative framework attentive to the longer term role of state policy and the interplay of historical and local processes. The case is then made for developing a historical sociology that engages with what is now happening in respect to young people and their employment security."

"Online and social media resilience in young people in vulnerable contexts Cyberbullying; Crime Victims; Workplace Bullying This Australian study explored the resilience to online abusive activity and enticements to violence amongst a cohort of young people in vulnerable contexts. The vulnerable contexts were defined as those where family disruption, domestic violence and subsequent geographical dislocation were present in the young personâ€™s environment. The young people, aged 12 to 19 years, were interviewed to elicit the prevalence of abusive or violent online and social media behaviours and were invited to discuss the resilience strategies they used to deal with such behaviours. Whilst resilience to online abusive activity has been studied in some depth, the prevalence of such activity and its effect upon young people in domestic violence or other abusive contexts has not. This study which examined the first-hand responses of a small number of young people in domestic violence contexts, found that the resilience strategies were dependent upon the maturity of the individual, the perceived support mechanisms available to the young person, the peer group attitude and the emotional attachment to the peer group. The results broadly match resilience strategies evident in the existing literature but add new knowledge about the significance of the maturation process and its effect upon resilience strategies for vulnerable youth. The study provides new insights into the development of resilience in online or social media contexts for young people in vulnerable contexts."
"The rise of ‘smart’ solutions in Africa: a review of the socio-environmental cost of the transportation and employment benefits of ride-hailing technology in Ghana Ghana; Urban Planning; Resource Curse Governments in Africa are licensing major global ride-hailing firms to launch operations in the continent. This is often presented as a refreshing development for the continent to leverage technology to address its twin problems of inefficient urban transport and rising youth unemployment. Interviews with ride-hailing adopters (drivers, riders, and car owners) and researchers in Ghana suggest, however, that whereas the technology is driving up the standards of road transport experience, the benefits are accessible to a select few (largely, the younger, highly educated and relatively high income-earning class). The lopsided power relations underlying the ride-hailing industry have also meant that the economic opportunities it avails disproportionately benefit a few powerful players (e.g. ride-hailing firms and car owners) while stimulating â€˜turf warsâ€™ among online and traditional taxi drivers; deepening existing gender inequalities in access to income-earning opportunities in the commercial passenger transport sector; encouraging unhealthy driving practices, shifts from shared public transport, and inundation of the roads with more private cars. While it will be imprecise to say that the private gains of ride-hailing outstrip the public costs and, therefore, the technology is detrimental to Ghanaâ€™s development, the considered evidence raises the need for sustained scrutiny of the hailing of technological interventions as though they are the magic bullets for socio-economic transformation in Africa. Overall, the paper argues that dismantling the power structures underlying Africaâ€™s urban challenges will require more than splashing â€˜smartâ€™ apps and other tech wizardries around. Indeed, the lessons from Ghanaâ€™s ride-hailing industry suggest that such exclusively technical solutions could easily take root and pattern after existing strictures of unjust power structures in ways that could exacerbate the social and environmental problems they are supposed to address."

"Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling in the Circular Economy: A Review Lithium-ion Batteries; Nickel Metal Hydride Batteries; Leaching Lithium-ion batteries have become a crucial part of the energy supply chain for transportation (in electric vehicles) and renewable energy storage systems. Recycling is considered one of the most effective ways for recovering the materials for spent LIB streams and circulating the material in the critical supply chain. However, few review articles have been published in the research domain of recycling and the circular economy, with most mainly focusing on either recycling methods or the challenges and opportunities in the circular economy for spent LIBs. This paper reviewed 93 articles (66 original research articles and 27 review articles) identified in the Web of Science core collection database. The study showed that publications in the area are increasing exponentially, with many focusing on recycling and recovery-related issues; policy and regulatory affairs received less attention than recycling. Most of the studies were experiments followed by evaluation and plan-ning (as per the categorization made). Pre-treatment processes were widely discussed, which is a critical part of hydrometallurgy and direct physical recycling (DPR). DPR is a promising recycling technique that requires further attention. Some of the issues that require further consideration in-clude a techno-economic assessment of the recycling process, safe reverse logistics, a global EV assessment revealing material recovery potential, and a lifecycle assessment of experiments processes (both in the hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes). Furthermore, the application of the circular business model and associated stakeholdersâ€™ engagement, clear and definitive policy guidelines, extended producer responsibility implications, and material tracking, and identification deserve further focus. This study presents several future research directions that would be useful for academics and policymakers taking necessary steps such as product design, integrated recycling techniques, intra-industry stakeholder cooperation, business model development, techno-economic analysis, and others towards achieving a circular economy in the LIB value chain."

"Valorization of solid waste using advanced thermo-chemical process: A review Plastic Waste; Pyrolysis; Catalyst Global economic development and continuous rise in the standard of living has led to resource depletion and increased per capita waste generation and, thus waste management issue becomes crucial. Sustainable development and circular economy require prominent technology for reducing the pace of resource depletion while producing alternatives to meet future energy demands. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a potential source of interest for the recovery of either secondary raw material or to produce energy. At present, most of the MSW in waste treatment plants is converted into recyclable fractions called Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) through the process of Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) with the aim of reducing environmental concerns and increasing its value. The focus of this review is to evaluate the importance of a thermo-chemical process for conversion of RDF into fuel and value-added products as well as evaluating applicability of this process in waste management sector and solid waste treatment. However, due to heterogeneous nature of RDF, investigation of co-pyrolysis behavior of RDF components as well as reaction mechanisms in both catalytic and non-catalytic reactions has been conducted. It has been observed that a high H/C, low O/C ratio and lower biomass content in RDF feed produces better quality products and decreases the dioxins emission during pyrolysis. Interactions of free radicals produced from polymer components with biomass greatly affect the product distribution. Chemicals derived out of RDF pyrolysis have been discussed and effect of various catalysts in enhancing oil yield and quality has been summarized. Catalytic pyrolysis with the use of P, Ni, Co, and Mo modified zeolite catalyst improves the quality of oil, and also the activity and catalyst lifetime. Different reactor technologies available for solid waste valorization have also been analyzed."

"Impacts of farmers' adaptation to drought and salinity intrusion on rice yield in Vietnam's Mekong Delta Crops; CERES (Experiment); Climate Change Impact Purpose: The Vietnamese Mekong River Delta (VMD) is one of the most affected deltas by climate change in the world. Several studies have investigated factors influencing farmers' climate change adaptation behaviors in the region; however, little is known about the effectiveness of such measures. This paper examines the determinants of adaptation strategies among VMD rice farmers and assesses the impacts of such practices on rice yield. Design/methodology/approach: Endogenous switching regressions were employed using a survey data of 300 rice-producing households in An Giang and Tra Vinh provinces in 2016. Findings: The results show that farmers receiving early disaster warnings are more likely to adopt adaptation measures to climate change. If nonadaptors had chosen to respond, their rice yield would have increased by 0.932 tons/ha/season. Research limitations/implications: The data sample is small and collected from two provinces in the VMD only; therefore, the results may be specific for the study sites. However, future research can adopt the proposed method for other regions. Originality/value: The study estimates the production impacts of farmers' decisions on whether or not to adapt to extreme climate events. The proposed approach allows for capturing both observed and unobserved behaviors."
"Reducing modern slavery with new information and enforcement technologies Forced and bonded labour, as well as poverty wages, have been uncovered in Australian meat and fashion manufacturing supply chains. Eight government inquiries since 2016 identified new business models entailing complex supply chains as a barrier to effective enforcement of labour standards. The application of information systems like blockchain has not yet been explored to aid enforcement efforts. This innovative research adopts a novel interdisciplinary approach, combining labour law, regulatory studies, information systems to evaluate information technologies and design tools that are feasible and readily useable. This promises to increase the capacity of regulators to detect and prevent modern slavery."

"Using species distribution models and decision tools to direct surveys and identify potential translocation sites for a critically endangered species Maximum Entropy; Ecosystem; Environmental Space Aim: Occurrence records for cryptic species are typically limited or highly uncertain, leaving their distributions poorly resolved and hampering conservation. This can apply to well-studied species, and increased survey effort and/or novel methods are required to improve distribution data. Here, we paired species distribution modelling (SDM) with decision tools to direct surveys for the critically endangered Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) outside its current restricted range. We also assessed survey areas for their suitability to host translocations. Location: Victoria, Australia. Method: We used both recent and historic records (now out of range and spatially uncertain) of Leadbeater's possum to build SDMs using MaxEnt. The SDMs informed an initial multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) that enabled prioritization of 80 survey sites across seven forest patches (13â€“145 km outside the known range), which we surveyed using camera traps. Site and vegetation data were used in a post-survey MCDA to rank their potential translocation suitability. Results: The SDM predictions were consistent with the speciesâ€™ ecology, identifying cold areas with high rainfall that had not recently burnt as suitable. The spatial uncertainty of records did not exert a strong influence on either model predictions or the ranking of patches for surveys. Camera trap surveys yielded records of 19 native species, with Leadbeater's possum detected in only one survey patch, 13 km outside of its previously known range. The post-survey MCDA identified three forest patches as potentially suitable for conservation translocations, and these priorities were not sensitive to the decision criteria used. Main conclusions: The approach outlined here prioritized survey effort over a large area, resulting in detection of Leadbeater's possum in one new patch. The potential translocation sites identified could present an important risk-spreading measure for the species given the threat posed by bushfire. Combining SDMs and decision tools can help target surveys and guide subsequent conservation strategies."

"Proteo-Molecular Investigation of Cultivated Rice, Wild Rice, and Barley Provides Clues of Defense Responses against Rhizoctonia solani Infection Leaf Blight; Thanatephorus Cucumeris; Quantitative Trait Loci Rhizoctonia solani is a soil-borne fungus causing sheath blight disease in cereal crops including rice. Genetic resistance to sheath blight disease in cereal crops is not well understood in most of the host(s). Aside from this, a comparative study on the different hosts at the biochemical and proteomic level upon R. solani infection was not reported earlier. Here, we performed proteomic based analysis and studied defense pathways among cultivated rice (cv. Pusa Basmati-1), wild rice accession (Oryza grandiglumis), and barley (cv. NDB-1445) after inoculation with R. solani. Increased levels of phenol, peroxidase, and Î²-1, 3-glucanase were observed in infected tissue as compared to the control in all of the hosts. Wild rice accession O. grandiglumis showed a higher level of biochemical signals than barley cv. NDB 1445 and cultivated rice cv. Pusa Basmati-1. Using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and mass spectrometry (MS), differently expressed proteins were also studied in control and after inoculation with R. solani. Wild rice accession O. grandiglumis induced a cysteine protease inhibitor and zinc finger proteins, which have defense functions and resistance against fungal pathogens. On the other hand, barley cv. NDB-1445 and cultivated rice cv. Pusa Basmati-1 mainly induce energy metabolism-related proteins/signals after inoculation with R. solani in comparison to wild rice accession O. grandiglumis. The present comprehensive study of R. solani interaction using three hosts, namely, Pusa Basmati-1 (cultivated rice), O. grandiglumis (wild rice), and NDB-1445 (barley) would interpret wider possibilities in the dissection of the protein(s) induced during the infection process. These proteins may further be correlated to the gene(s) and other related molecular tools that will help for the marker-assisted breeding and/or gene editing for this distressing disease among the major cereal crops."

"Vacancy-modified g-C3N4 and its photocatalytic applications Cyanogen; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Photocatalysts As an emerging semiconductor-based catalyst, g-C3N4 has attracted significant attention for visible light-driven photocatalytic energy conversion, synthesis of chemicals, and environmental remediation. However, pristine g-C3N4 exhibits a weak response to visible light, low surface area, and rapid photogenerated carrier recombination. Thus, the introduction of structural vacancies can deeply modify the morphology and band structure of g-C3N4 to overcome these issues. This work provides a critical overview and perspective on the recent development of g-C3N4 photocatalysts modified by carbon (Cv) and nitrogen vacancies (Nv), or both, and their implementation in various photocatalytic applications. Initially, the methods for the identification of Cv and Nv in g-C3N4 and their critical role in altering the morphological and structural properties of g-C3N4 are presented. Then, the strategies for manipulating the microstructure and properties of g-C3N4 are critically discussed, including modification with Nv, Cv, and functional groups or their combination, porous architecture engineering, heteroatom doping, texture and surface area mediation, and their combinations. Based on vacancy modification and other positive structural tuning aspects, the corresponding photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 is analyzed for the applications currently attracting significant research attention, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, NO removal, pollutant degradation, selective oxidation, and H2O2 production. Finally, the current challenges and future research suggestions regarding the vacancy modification of g-C3N4 are presented."

"Building capacity for a user‐centred integrated early warning system for drought in Papua New Guinea Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China Drought has significant impacts on the agricultural productivity and wellâ€being of Pacific Island communities. In this study, a userâ€centred integrated early warning system (Iâ€EWS) for drought was investigated for Papua New Guinea (PNG). The Iâ€EWS combines satellite products (Standardised Precipitation Index and Vegetation Health Index) with seasonal probabilistic forecasting outputs (chance of exceeding median rainfall). Internationally accepted drought thresholds for each of these inputs are conditionally combined to trigger three drought early warning stagesâ€” â€DROUGHT WATCHâ€, â€œDROUGHT ALERTâ€ and â€œDROUGHT EMERGENCYâ€. The developed Iâ€ EWS for drought was used to examine the evolution of a strong El NiÃ±oâ€induced drought event in 2015 as well as a weaker La NiÃ±aâ€induced dry period in 2020. Examining the evolution of drought early warnings at a provincial level, it was found that tailored warning lead times of 3â€“5 months could have been possible for several impacted PNG provinces. These lead times would enable in-creasingly proactive drought responses with the potential for prioritised allocation of funds at a provincial level. The methodology utilised within this study uses inputs that are openly and freely available globally which indicates promising potential for adaptation of the developed userâ€centred Iâ€EWS in other Pacific Island Countries that are vulnerable to drought."

"Vocational education and the revitalisation of manufacturing in the United States Apprenticeship Training; Firm; Human Capital Theory Manufacturing in advanced open economies has experienced significant disruption. Rapid technological change, outsourcing and off shoring have beset manufacturing resulting in a general and steady decline in manufacturing employment. Despite this turbulence, there remains a strong nostalgia for manufacturing resulting in frequent public policy discussion about how best to revitalise the industry. A popular view is that a strong manufacturing industry relies upon an equally strong vocational, education and training (VET) system to provide requisite skill needs. Given the dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing industry do such arguments still hold true? This paper considers this question through an examination of what the revitalisation of US manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and the extent to which USâ€™s decentralised and largely eroded VET system serves as a barrier to the industryâ€™s revitalisation. Drawing upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and secondary data collected in three US cities, the paper argues that the focus on needing to have a strong VET system overlooks the emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems that evolve to address local skill needs. These micro skill eco-systems open the prospects for skills and training innovations to meet changing workforce needs in a changing industry."

"Procurement sustainability tensions: an integrative perspective Institutional Work; Illegitimacy; Microfoundations Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to unpack tensions faced by procurement professionals as part of their triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability activities. The authors take an integrative perspective based on the procurement sustainability and organizational tensions literature, as well as stakeholder and institutional theory. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a multiple case study approach. Data are collected through multiple interviews and archival data from eight case companies in Australia. Findings: The authors identify supply chain and company procurement sustainability tensions (PSTs) and explain their multi-level nature. The analysis also dissects the multi-stakeholder and multi-institutional environments where PSTs operate. The authors discuss such environments in terms of various temporal and spatial legitimacy contexts (LCs) that, through their assessment of institutional distance, can characterize the manifestation of PSTs. Practical implications: The findings are instrumental for managers to make informed decisions when dealing with PSTs, and they pave the way for paradoxical leadership given the increasing importance of simultaneous development and balancing of TBL dimensions, as evidenced in this study. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies to empirically investigate PSTs by drawing on an integrative approach to identify PSTs, and to discern various LCs that underpin stakeholder judgments of procurementâ€™s TBL sustainability activities."

"Life cycle assessment of alkali-activated concretes under marine exposure in an Australian context Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali Alkali-activated concretes have been shown to be an environmentally advantageous construction material as they utilize waste or by-products as precursors, such as fly ash and ground blast furnace slag. These concretes also have the ability to achieve strengths suitable for structural applications. However, each mix design of an alkali-activated concretes is unique and requires a detailed life cycle analysis to determine the environmental impact and cost viability. This study evaluates the feasibility of alkali-activated fly ash or fly ash geopolymer and alkali-activated slag concrete developed for application in Australia currently subject to long term site performance studies. This paper reports a detailed life cycle assessment analysis of these concretes to assess their environmental footprint. The paper considers three distinct allocation methods: baseline, mass, and economic allocation, with two system boundaries: manufacture and construction. The study shows AAS concrete has a lower environmental impact than an equivalent strength PC concrete in two impact categories, global warming potential and eutrophication, while acidification and human toxicity depend on the allocation method applied in the manufacturing stage. The global warming potential (100-years) of AAS is 5.25â€“35% less than PC concrete. The FAGP concrete has more negative impacts on the environment than PC-based concrete, regardless of which allocation method is applied. The report highlights alkaline activators and transportation of raw materials as the main environmental impact contributors to concrete manufacture. The global warming potential of FAGP is 22â€“34% higher than the equivalent PC concrete in the baseline method. For the construction stage boundary, machinery appliances for handling concrete and transportation only contributes a small environmental impact (<4%) compared with concrete manufacturing. Cost estimation for concrete production suggests that the cost of the alkali-activated concrete is competitive with the conventional concrete market, dependant on the proximity of the feedstocks and the cost of sodium silicate. Neglecting the transportation cost of feedstocks, the cost of AAS concrete can be 4.8% cheaper, whereas the cost of FAGP concrete is 2.7% more expensive than PC concrete."

"From me to us: Strengthening our Financial Capabilities Subjective Well-Being; Happiness; Life Satisfaction For low-income or precariously employed households in Australia, the re-allocation of risk over the past forty years has four crucial economic dimensions: the fraying of the social security net; changes in labour market dynamics; heightened uncertainty arising from income volatilities; and new hazards generated by the financialisation of daily life. Household financial capabilities are negatively influenced by the compounding impacts of each of these risks. Case examples from a BSL study illustrate each impact and their interactions. The dominant idea that individual capabilities are malleable (and thus can be optimised) whilst circumstances and norms are fixed is countered by an expanded view of Senâ€™s/Nussbaumâ€™s capability approach (CA) that includes collective capabilities. Collective capabilities can change norms, and so, the concept provides a needed link between the political and macroeconomic movement of risk re-allocation and individual or household financial capabilities. The Australian Unemployed Workersâ€™ Union is used as an example to show how collective action can challenge structural conditions, and expand or protect the capabilities of individuals."

The present study is focused on developing two high-volume fly ash (HVFA) concretes with cement replacement levels of 65% (HVFA-65) and 80% (HVFA-80). The required lime for both HVFA concrete mixtures was initially determined and the optimized mixture designs identified, based on the 28-day compressive strength, by varying the low-calcium Class F fly ash-hydrated lime composition. The optimized concrete mixtures achieved a compressive strength of 53 and 40 MPa (7.69 and 5.80 ksi) for HVFA-65 and HVFA-80 concretes, respectively. The early-stage strength development is dependent on the matrix produced in the specific HVFA concrete, which is itself dependent on the number of unreacted fly ash spheres. The increase of fly ash and hydrated lime dosage in HVFA concrete increases the rate of hydration of the C3A and C4AF phases, but decreases the hydration of the C3S phase, which resulted in lower early-age strength development than occurs in PC concrete. It was noted that the initial setting time of HVFA concretes increase with an increase of fly ash content. However, addition of hydrated lime accelerates the hydration and decreases the final setting time for HVFA concretes."

"Australian aid in Papua New Guinea: Men’s views on pay disparities, power imbalances and written products in the development sector Melanesia; Vanuatu; Papua New Guinea This article explores the frustrations of men â€“ both â€˜localâ€™ and â€˜internationalâ€™ â€“ who work in the development sector in Papua New Guinea. It explores the views of men not because they are the only ones to express such dissatisfaction, but because their perspectives have not been documented, other than in informal conversations as occur over drinks or messaging platforms. These multiple narratives show how a combination of pay variations, different cultural vantage points, and bureaucratic dynamics leaves both constituencies feeling inconsequential, diminished, and disempowered. The research extends previous work with women. The article reflects a contribution to three bodies of literature which examine, respectively, the professional middle class in Melanesia; linkages between colonialism and racialised hierarchies reproduced in and through development; and the hierarchies of aid and professionalised international development, structures that have been likened to an â€˜aid chainâ€™."

"Potential for sustainable utilisation of agricultural residues for bioenergy production in Pakistan: An overview Pakistan; Renewable Energy Policy; Fossil Fuel Pakistan's current energy portfolio is problematic due to a lack of proper management and implementation of appropriate energy policies. This densely populated country has a high energy demand that rises yearly and is expected to increase three-fold by 2050. However, fossil fuel resources are continuously depleting by global overuse while negatively impacting the environment through increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This study reviewed the potential for agricultural residues to be used as renewable energy sources for bioenergy production in Pakistan to address the energy-related challenges that would also help in addressing the economic and environmental concerns. First, a comparison was made between the current energy situation, potential renewable energy scenarios, and global trends. Second, greenhouse gas (i.e., CO2) emissions in Pakistan were summarised and compared with other regions. Third, the thermochemical properties of different agricultural residues were reviewed along with varying the options of processing to produce renewable energy such as thermochemical conversion approaches (combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and liquefaction) and biochemical conversion options (anaerobic digestion, and fermentation). Pakistan being an agricultural-based economy, produces vast quantities of agricultural residue biomass, which is mostly underutilized as animal feed, conventional fuel substitutes, left to rot in fields or burnt to get rid, resulting in the vast emissions of greenhouse gases causing severe environmental pollution and smog formation. A considerable share of Pakistan's national energy demand can be fulfilled if these feedstocks are adequately managed and exploited through the energy sector and converted into large-scale bioenergy."

"Recycling waste vehicle tyres into crumb rubber and the transition to renewable energy sources: A comprehensive life cycle assessment Asphalt Mixtures; Rutting; Asphalt This study conducts a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) on converting waste vehicle tyres into recycled crumb rubber (CR) granules as an alternative polymer for enhancing asphalt properties. The LCA study has been performed on acquired industrial primary data by incorporating CR at different proportions of binder in one ton (1-ton) of asphalt mix following the wet method. The uncertainty analysis of design variables identified a relatively strong positive relation of emissions with the equipment energy consumption (r = 0.98). Monte Carlo simulations evaluate the potential renewable sources (solar, hydro, and wind) in sequence over fossil fuels for the possible transition in the Australian grid by 2030 and 2050, as per the Paris Agreement. 71.91% reduction of CO2 emissions is achievable by recycling vehicle tyres into crumb rubber compared to landfill and incineration. Recycling by-products of CR production, such as steel and textile, significantly mitigates negative impacts. A decrease of 2.23% emissions was associated to the use of crumb rubber as a binder modifier in the asphalt mixture via the midpoint assessment. In endpoint LCA, a higher association of resource (US$) saving costs was observed than for other protective zones, i.e., human health and ecosystem damage. Recycling 466,000 tonnes of disposable waste tyres contributes to 16.1 million US$ worth of resource savings. An equitable industry-based LCA and uncertainty analysis of design parameters can assist in prioritizing suitable options to improve efficiency and future emission strategies on a global scale."
"Self-regulated, glucose-responsive nanomaterials for smart insulin delivery (administered by Monash University) Type 1 diabetes affects over 120,000 Australians and is associated with an up to a 4-fold increase in mortality. It is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Insulin injections are required for survival in type 1 diabetes. The major hurdle to achieving good glycaemic control with insulin is hypoglycaemia. Glucose lowering without the risk of hypoglycaemia would revolutionise the management of type 1 and possibly type 2 diabetes. This goal can be achieved with glucose-responsive insulin which would function in a similar manner as a β-cell.

"Incorporation of quantum carbon dots into a PVP/ZnO hydrogel for use as an effective hexavalent chromium sensing platform Fluorescence; Nanodots; Carbon Nanoparticles Hydrogels offer a unique medium for sensing applications as they can draw upon the benefits of both solid and liquid sensing platforms. Incorporation of functionalised fluorescent nanoparticles within the hydrogel matrix results in a three-dimensional nanocomposite capable of interacting with water-soluble analytes, facilitating quantitative sensing applications. Here, we report the solvothermal synthesis of a novel Polyvinylpyrrolidone assembled hydrogel stabilised with zinc oxide quantum dots which does not require additional organic crosslinkers. Functionalization of these hydrogel with novel, brightly photoluminescent 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol quantum carbon dots (quantum yield of 62.5%) results in a composite capable of specific interaction with hexavalent chromium. Quantitative fluorescence quenching measurements of the hydrogel composite in the presence of hexavalent chromium shows a limit of detection of 1.2 Î¼M Cr6+ which is below maximum allowable concentrations for drinking water. The hydrogel composite is cheap to manufacture and can be injected into 96 well plates for high throughput analysis of environmental water samples. These results are encouraging for the development of hydrogels and polymetric films to be used as novel fluorescent sensing platforms for environmental diagnostic applications."

"Direct and residual effect of biochar derived from biosolids on soil phosphorus pools: A four-year field assessment Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Measures to improve the use of phosphorus (P), either by improved efficiency or reuse, are needed worldwide in order to preserve a finite resource and ensure that farmers have access to it. Currently, the rapidly growing global population has generated an increased demand for this mineral. Sustainably disposing for the massive amount of globally produced biosolids and alternative sources of P for agriculture are two major challenges to address. In this scenario, biosolids-derived biochar (BBC) has been presented as a win-win opportunity. However, the BBC-P dynamics in soil over consecutive cropping seasons remain unclear. Direct (first and second cropping season) and residual (third and fourth cropping season) effects of BBC on soil P fractions, P uptake and corn grain yield were assessed. Additionally, the relationships between soil P pools and grain yield were investigated by multivariate and multiple linear regression analysis. In a field experiment, BBC produced at 300 Â°C (BC 300) and 500 Â°C (BC 500) were applied to an Oxisol at a rate of 15 t haâˆ’1. Soil total P and its fractions (organic P, inorganic P, and available P) were determined. Phosphorus uptake and corn grain yield were also evaluated. BBC, regardless of pyrolysis temperature, increased soil total P and all P fractions. Moreover, BBC maintained high soil P contents for at least two years after stopping its application. These results suggest that BBC may act as a slow-release P fertilizer. Surprisingly, soil P fractions were unaffected by different pyrolysis temperatures, but BC 300 promoted higher grain yield than BC 500 in the third and fourth cropping seasons. Overall, the results confirmed that under direct application both biochars can replace mineral fertilization for corn production; and when considering the residual effect, BC 300 showed a higher potential to be utilized as a soil amendment for P supply."

"Adaptive governance in carbon farming policies Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework This book discusses a variety of different perspectives involved in biodiversity management and bio-sequestration projects in Australia, working towards achieving adaptive governance in carbon farming. It not only examines landholders' motivation but also the challenges of integrating biodiverse forests into the agricultural landscape. Drawing on the contrast between science and policy stakeholders' views on carbon farming and the practical challenges of achieving adaptive governance, the book discusses the significant gap between theory and practice encountered in this field of study. The book suggests ways of improving the decision-making capacity of government officials and policymakers involved in managing carbon and biodiversity markets, as well as introducing measures to promote adaptive governance by engaging landholders in more effective land conservation. Climate change is a pressing issue on the global political agenda, and this book makes an important contribution to the ongoing debate. This book will be an invaluable reference for practitioners, policymakers and researchers interested in alternative forms of governance in natural resource management."

"3D Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy for Quantification of the Phase Behaviour in Agarose-MCC co-gels in Comparison to the Rheological Blending-law Analysis Emulsions; Microgels; Gel The need for a rapid and direct alternative to the rheology-based blending laws in quantifying phase behaviour in biopolymer composite gels is explored in this study. In doing so, the efficacy of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) paired with image analysis software â€“ FIJI and Imaris - in quantifying phase volume was studied. That was carried out in a model system of agarose with varying concentrations of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) in comparison to the rheological blending laws. Structural studies performed using SEM, FTIR, differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic oscillation in-shear unveiled a continuous, weak agarose network supporting the hard, rod-shaped MCC inclusions where the composite gel strength increased with higher â€˜fillerâ€™ concentration. The phase volumes of MCC, estimated with the microscopic protocol, matched the predictions obtained from computerized modelling using the Lewis-Nielsen blending laws. Results highlight the suitability of the microscopic protocol in estimating the water partition and effective phase volumes in the agarose-MCC composite gel."
"Circularity in the Built Environment: A Focus on India Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals The built environment operates in a linear way where large amounts of non-renewable resources are used to feed the growing and rapid city building activities taking place globally, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. Recent estimates from the World Bank (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2017, p. 4) indicate that over half of the worldâ€™s population will live in urban areas, whilst providing over 80% of global GDP generation. Building and construction uses 36% of energy consumption, produces 40% waste and estimated approximately 40% carbon dioxide emissions (GABC 2017). â€˜Achieving Growthâ€™ (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2017, p. 12) has identified 115 billion euros investment opportunities in the built environment for designing and constructing buildings based on circular principles, closing the loop on building construction and demolition materials, and building circular cities. Not just creating jobs, application of circular principles supports resilience, reduces resource use and lowers overall emissions. This paper focuses on India as an emerging economy. It discusses the potential of placing the country on a path of circularity with reference to the built environment. Two case studies are used to demonstrate examples of as-yet untapped upscaling potential of integrating principles of circularity. It offers opportunities to increase knowledge in the sector, develop mainstreaming platforms from fragmented examples, and most importantly decoupling economic growth with resource consumption. By sharing these learnings, the key value drivers of increasing life cycles of the asset from multiple functional perspectives, increasing utilization and expanding regenerative potentials in an increasingly digitized world are highlighted."

"Tourism Ethnocentrism and Its Effects on Tourist and Resident Behavior Destination; Ecotourism; Destination Management People often demonstrate a home country bias toward their own nation over other nations. This bias is an important determinant of their behavior. Drawing on seminal research from marketing and psychology, the authors provide the first investigation of the tourism ethnocentrism (TE) phenomenon that captures touristsâ€™ and residentsâ€™ motivation to support the domestic tourism economy. The research reported herein develops the parsimonious, reliable, and valid TE scale, and provides an empirical test thereof. The results show that TE is an important means to investigate both touristsâ€™ and residentsâ€™ behavior. It drives touristsâ€™ willingness to engage in and recommend domestic tourism, as well as residentsâ€™ support for domestic tourism development. The results further reveal that higher levels of touristsâ€™ â€œperceived self-efficacy to contribute to the domestic economyâ€ and lower levels of â€œperceived economy support of othersâ€ strengthen TEâ€™s effect. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice."

"Spatial and temporal variations of trace metal body burdens of live mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis and field validation of the Artificial Mussels in Australian inshore marine environment Mytilus Galloprovincialis; Bivalvia; Heavy Metal The body burdens of eight trace metals: Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr, Se, Hg, and As, were measured in live mussels (LMs) Mytilus galloprovincialis at 14 coastal sites in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia in winter and summer between 2017 and 2018. The spatial and temporal variations of body burdens were evaluated. The results revealed significantly higher body burdens of Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr, and Hg in summer at the sites where the city centre and industries are located. Elevated levels of most trace metals including 3 toxic, non-essential metals (Cd, Pb, and Hg) were detected in LMs from the site of Geelong. The body burdens of Zn, Cr, Se, and As appeared higher at the sites from the Bellarine Peninsula and the mouth of Port Phillip Bay. Besides, the â€œArtificial Musselsâ€ (AMs) were deployed at the same sites in summer for 28 d and retrieved when the LMs were collected. The accumulations of the eight metals were compared between AMs and LMs summer results. It indicated significant correlations for Pb, Cu, and Cr, lower correlations in Zn and Hg, and irregular correlations for Se and As. The AM results of Cd were below the detection limit of the analytical method. This study demonstrates that AMs are excellent replacement of LMs for the biomonitoring of multiple kinds of trace metals."
"Engineering meets institutions: an interdisciplinary approach to the management of resilience Critical Infrastructure; Resilience; Disaster Resilience management stretches across the decoupled domains of community, corporate, and public governance. As a result, fostering resilience needs a governance structure that supports collective actions and integrates fragmented fields with different institutional frameworks. In this study, we carry out a review of three different perspectives on resilience -engineering, social, and organizational- in order to explore resilience management in the context of governance of infrastructure systems. We discuss the common practices to address resilience of engineering systems, the need and current trend for integration of institutions into these practices through formal (e.g., policies and regulations) as well as informal mechanisms (e.g., trust, norms, and shared cognitive structures). To illustrate our theorizing, we provide three illustrative case studies. The cases highlight the barriers and enablers across the three perspectives and highlight the inter-organizational context of management of resilience. We uncovered organizational dynamics such as the necessity of establishing critical functionality through organizational capacity for stakeholder engagement, the need for diverse organizations to address institutional complexity in management of resilience, and the importance of decoupling in aligning the outcomes of resilience management practices with policies. We suggest an agenda for future research on managing practices associated with management of resilience."

"Performance evaluation of A2O MBR system with graphene oxide (GO) blended polysulfone (PSf) composite membrane for treatment of high strength synthetic wastewater containing lead Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling High strength synthetic wastewater containing 5 mg Lâˆ’1 of lead was studied for treatment using an A2O MBR system. The system showed 99% removal of ammonia and COD, a maximum removal of 52% of total phosphorus and an average minimum removal of 72% of total nitrogen. A maximum lead removal of 98% was achieved for hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 144 h, which decreased to 85% when the influent COD concentration was decreased. Mass balance for lead revealed that much of its removal was through accumulation by the biomass present in the anaerobic and anoxic tanks. Comparative study on virgin PSf and GO blended PSf membrane showed that the GO blended membrane lasted 1.4 times longer than the other. SEM-EDS of membranes showed lead peaks on the fouled and un-fouled sections of the membranes indicating the association of lead with the foulant and the role of membrane in lead separation. Good separation efficiency was achieved irrespective of the membranes used."

"Unconditional cash transfers, child labour and education: theory and evidence Child Labor; Family Characteristic; School Attendance We examine the impact of unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) on child labour and educational outcomes. We first develop a simple theoretical model where we explore how government transfers financed by labour income taxation affect household decisions on child labour and education. We then empirically examine the impact of Pakistan's Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), which is the largest cash transfer program in South Asia, on child labour and school outcomes. We employ a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to estimate the average effect of the UCTs on child labour and school outcomes, and find that UCTs have a positive and statistically significant impact on school enrolment and grade promotion, but no impact on school dropout rates in the short run. The BISP policy intervention increases grade promotion amongst boys but not amongst girls. In the short run, the BISP substantially reduces dropout for boys but increases substantially for girls. With regards to child labour, we find that the BISP policy intervention has no impact on child labour in the short run; but in the medium to long run, cash transfers help to reduce child labour amongst boys as well as girls. In the short run, however, the BISP increases child labour amongst girls but not boys. These findings are largely consistent with our theoretical predictions and also robust to a series of robustness and sensitivity checks."

"Feasibility analysis of an islanded hybrid wind-diesel-battery microgrid with voltage and power response for offshore Islands Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems Practically feasible and applicable design of a hybrid micro-grid wind-diesel alternative energy system has been demonstrated to get the results to fulfil the load demand of 115 kWh/d and a peak load of 11.2 kW for a small community of Mersing town, Malaysia. The whole optimization process has been conducted with the consideration of meteorological data and the technical specifications of each module by the proper utilization of the iHOGA renewable energy software, DIgSILENT PowerFactory and Matlab Simulink. From the simulation results, it can be observed that the designed and simulated Islanded Hybrid Microgrid System (IHMS) is economically and environmentally feasible, and the simulation results reported as the net present cost, cost of energy and CO2 emission, are being reduced by about 72%, 73.5% and 82% respectively per year compared to the conventional power plant of the Tanjung Bin Energy Power Plant, Johor, Malaysia. Moreover, the voltage, power and frequency responses also checked and compared with the practical results and ensured the stability of the whole energy system. Besides this, the system reliability indices also analysed and reported to ensure the technical and economic feasibility of the designed system. The optimization results reported that the least cost of energy is about USD 0.05/kWh and the net present cost is USD 77,286. The comparison between the analysed hybrid energy system and conventional energy systems has been reported properly to justify the importance of renewable energy resources all over the world. This optimized combination of the hybrid alternative energy system will be applicable for all other locations in the world with similar meteorological and environmental conditions."

"Reducing GHG emissions and treating contaminants using own resources: A new lookout for water industries Biogas and biosolids are the two most valuable products generated from the treatment of wastewater. Biogas is used for energy generation while biosolids are beneficiated for agriculture land application. The presence of emerging contaminants such as PFAS and micro-plastics in biosolids poses some serious concerns about their land applications. In today?s carbon constrained world, the greenhouse gas emissions from biogas combustion may not be acceptable. Water industries are constantly searching for cost-effective solutions to deal with emerging contaminants and reduce their carbon emissions. From the preliminary work conducted by the current PhD student under the supervision of A/Prof Kalpit Shah, it has been successfully demonstrated that biosolids and biogas can be converted into hydrogen and carbon nanomaterials. Hydrogen can be used for clean energy generation while carbon nanomaterials can be used for removing PFAS and other contaminants from the wastewater stream. The current proposal provides cost-effective alternative that can deal with emerging contaminants and reduce carbon emissions issues in an integrated manner."
"A comparison of environmental impacts between rainwater harvesting and rain garden scenarios Bioretention Areas; Stormwater Management; Green Infrastructure Rain garden (RG) is a simple alternative to reduce pollutant loads carried through runoff. However, RG construction impacts the environment, where it demands evidence of net benefits generated once commissioned for operation. This study has simulated the reduction of runoff and pollutant loads due to the installation of RGs. Consequently, the reduction of the impacts on the environment was estimated using the LCA method. A comparison was carried out between the scenarios with and without RG with the most feasible (environmentally) rainwater harvesting (RWH) system. Three RG sizes are considered, such as 3, 4, and 6 m2 in dry, average, and wet annual rainfall conditions. The catchment-scale results showed that the runoff generation impacts of the RGs' operation phase were about (24â€“54%), (21â€“49%), (21â€“47%), and (14â€“45%) of the system without RG on eutrophication, human toxicity-carcinogenic, ecotoxicity-freshwater, and ecotoxicity-marine, respectively. However, once fabrication & installation were added, RG had much higher net impacts than without RG, except for eutrophication and ecotoxicity-freshwater. Hence, the net ecotoxicity-freshwater impact was lower for all scenarios except 4 and 6 m2 RG sizes during dry rainfall conditions. The most feasible RWH scenarios (e.g., 2000 & 3000 L tanks) had net impacts of 3â€“81% of the RG systems on global warming, human toxicity-carcinogenic, and ecotoxicity-terrestrial categories. On the other hand, RWH had net impacts of 105â€“200% on ozone depletion and eutrophication and 51â€“119% on the ecotoxicity-freshwater and ecotoxicity-marine of the RG systems."

"Opportunity Assessment: B4 - Flexible demand and demand control technology and development (Project No. 20.B4.00132) This research theme focuses on helping Australian businesses to develop flexible demand and demand control technology (load flexibility).
Load flexibility is the active modification of energy (usually electricity) demand in response to an internal or external incentive1. Examples of how this can be achieved include process rescheduling or using energy storage options (thermal, battery, material, pumped and
other).
Improving load flexibility for businesses is a win-win-win: businesses pay less for their electricity onsite, and their new energy use profile can also benefit the market as a whole; network businesses need to invest less in the network to supply electricity reliably, reducing
costs for all customers; and more variable renewables (e.g. solar and wind) can be hosted on the grid (e.g. through less curtailment of solar generation.)"

"Strategic approaches to restoring ecosystems can triple conservation gains and halve costs Forest Restoration; Tropical Dry Forests; Environmental Restoration And Remediation International commitments for ecosystem restoration add up to one-quarter of the worldâ€™s arable land. Fulfilling them would ease global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity decline but could displace food production and impose financial costs on farmers. Here, we present a restoration prioritization approach capable of revealing these synergies and trade-offs, incorporating ecological and economic efficiencies of scale and modelling specific policy options. Using an actual large-scale restoration target of the Atlantic Forest hotspot, we show that our approach can deliver an eightfold increase in cost-effectiveness for biodiversity conservation compared with a baseline of non-systematic restoration. A compromise solution avoids 26% of the biomeâ€™s current extinction debt of 2,864 plant and animal species (an increase of 257% compared with the baseline). Moreover, this solution sequesters 1 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent (a 105% increase) while reducing costs by US$28 billion (a 57% decrease). Seizing similar opportunities elsewhere would offer substantial contributions to some of the greatest challenges for humankind."

"Thermal performance evaluation of eco-friendly bricks incorporating waste glass sludge Clay Brick; Brick; Husk Ash Approximately, 0.3 million tons of waste glass sludge (WGS), a by-product of plate glass manufacturing is being landfilled or discarded every year around the globe. Previously, mechanical and durability properties of burnt clay bricks incorporating WGS were reported by authors. The focus of this study is to explore the thermal properties of industrially manufactured burnt clay bricks incorporating WGS. For this purpose, WGS was obtained from a local glass cutting and polishing industry. Burnt clay bricks incorporating different dosages of WGS (i.e, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% by weight of clay) were prepared in an industrial kiln and were studied for different physico-mechanical and thermal properties. It was observed that dense brick specimens can be manufactured by using WGS in replacement of clay. Increase in compressive strength of clay bricks was observed after addition of WGS. Burnt clay bricks incorporating 25% WGS showed 37% increase in compressive strength. Reduction in apparent porosity and water absorption was also observed with increasing content of WGS in brick specimens. Microscopic images also showed dense and homogenous structure with reduced porosity after adding WGS in brick specimens, which increased the thermal conductivity of burnt clay bricks incorporating WGS. Control brick specimens showed thermal conductivity of 0.53 W/mK, which increased to 0.59 W/mK after incorporating 25% WGS in brick specimens. However, results were observed within the thermal conductivity range (i.e., 0.4â€“0.7 W/mK) of traditional burnt clay bricks for masonry construction. Based on this study, utilization of WGS (up to 25%) in the production of burnt clay bricks can be helpful in reducing the landfill and associated environmental problems of WGS. Moreover, burnt clay bricks with improved properties can be manufactured on industrial scale leading towards sustainable and cleaner production."

"Effects of manure waste biochars in mining soils Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Land degradation by old mining activities is a concern worldwide. However, many known technologies are expensive and cannot be considered for mining soil restoration. Biochar amendment of mining soils is becoming an interesting alternative to traditional technologies due to an improvement in soil properties and metal mobility reduction. Biochar effects depend on soil and biochar properties, which in turn vary with pyrolysis conversion parameters and the feedstock used. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of four biochars prepared from poultry and rabbit manure at two pyrolysis temperatures (450 and 600 Â°C) in the trace metal mobility, CO2 emissions, and enzymatic activity of 10 mining soils located in three historical mining areas of Spain (Zarandas-Andalusia, Mijarojos-Cantabria, and Portman-Murcia). For this reason, soils were amended with biochars at a rate of 10% (w/w), and different treatments were incubated for 180 days. For acid soils of the Zarandas-Andalusia area, biochar addition reduced the mobility of Ni, Zn, Cd, Pb, and Cr, respectively, by 91%, 81%, 29%, 67%, and 70%. Nevertheless, biochars did not exhibit the same efficiency in the other two areas where alkaline soils were predominant. CO2 emissions generally increased in the treated soils. The application of biochars produced at 600 Â°C reduced CO2 emissions, in some cases by more than 28%, being an adequate strategy for C sequestration in soil. The results showed that application of manure biochars can be an effective technique to reduce the mobility of metals in multi-contaminated acid soils, while reducing metal toxicity for soil microorganisms."

"Using photovoice to examine physical activity in the urban context and generate policy recommendations: The heart healthy hoods study Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians A current challenge in physical activity research is engaging citizens with co-creating policies that support physical activity participation. Using Photovoice, a participatory action research method, the objectives of this study were to: 1) Identify community perceptions of urban built, social, and political/economic environment factors associated with physical activity; and 2) generate community-driven policy recommendations to increase physical activity. Two districts in Madrid of varying socio-economic status (SES) were selected. Overall, 24 residents participated in 4 groups stratified by sex and district (6 participants per group). Groups met weekly for 4 weeks to discuss and analyze their photographs. Participants coded photographs into categories, which were then regrouped into broader themes. The categories were transformed into policy recommendations using an adaptation of the logical framework approach. Participants took 161 photos, which were classified into 61 categories and 14 broader themes (e.g., active transportation, sport in the city). After this, participants generated a set of 34 policy recommendations to improve the urban environment to support physical activity (e.g., to redistribute sports facilities). Collaboration between citizens and researchers led to a deeper understanding of the community perceptions of urban built, social, and political/economic environment factors associated with physical activity in two districts of Madrid, while engaging citizens in recommending public policies."

"Design, construction, and operation of the first industrial salinity-gradient solar pond in Europe: An efficiency analysis perspective Solar Ponds; Salinity; Exergy A 500 m2 industrial salinity-gradient solar pond (SGSP) was constructed in a mineral processing plant (Solvay Minerales) in Granada (Spain). This renewable energy technology was designed to supply a low-temperature heat (up to 60 Â°C) to achieve the temperature requirements of the flotation mineral purification stage. The low-temperature source was integrated to partially replace the fuel oil boiler used to heat the water used in the flotation stage. Theoretical calculations based on solar radiation indicated that the use of the SGSP would reduce the annual fuel consumption by more than 50%, thus providing a significant improvement at both economic and environmental levels. Two months after the SGSP was established, in August 2014, the temperature in the storage zone of the SGSP reached approximately 90 Â°C. The overall performance was evaluated in two periods (2014 and 2015) in terms of the retrofitting of mining facility with a solar pond and a new method to assess the thermal efficiency of the solar pond in a long-term perspective has been proposed. The overall efficiencies obtained after the first and second operation periods were 10 and 12%, respectively, with maximum values of 28 and 24% obtained during the first operation months. Regarding the economic savings, the fuel oil cost of the flotation unit was reduced by a higher percentage than the fuel oil consumption, due to the decreasing tendency of fuel oil prices during 2014 and 2015. Reductions of 52 and 68% were obtained in the first and second periods of operation, respectively, when compared to 2013. In addition, not only does the SGSP have considerably reduced operating costs but also the environmental costs are clearly reduced when considering the reduction of CO2 emissions."

"Global injury morbidity and mortality from 1990 to 2017: Results from the global burden of disease study 2017 Prediabetes; Dexmedetomidine; Correlation Background Past research in population health trends has shown that injuries form a substantial burden of population health loss. Regular updates to injury burden assessments are critical. We report Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 Study estimates on morbidity and mortality for all injuries. methods We reviewed results for injuries from the GBD 2017 study. GBD 2017 measured injury-specific mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) using the Cause of Death Ensemble model. To measure non-fatal injuries, GBD 2017 modelled injury-specific incidence and converted this to prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs). YLLs and YLDs were summed to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Findings In 1990, there were 4 260 493 (4 085 700 to 4 396 138) injury deaths, which increased to 4 484 722 (4 332 010 to 4 585 554) deaths in 2017, while age-standardised mortality decreased from 1079 (1073 to 1086) to 738 (730 to 745) per 100 000. In 1990, there were 354 064 302 (95% uncertainty interval: 338 174 876 to 371 610 802) new cases of injury globally, which increased to 520 710 288 (493 430 247 to 547 988 635) new cases in 2017. During this time, age-standardised incidence decreased non-significantly from 6824 (6534 to 7147) to 6763 (6412 to 7118) per 100 000. Between 1990 and 2017, age-standardised DALYs decreased from 4947 (4655 to 5233) per 100 000 to 3267 (3058 to 3505). Interpretation Injuries are an important cause of health loss globally, though mortality has declined between 1990 and 2017. Future research in injury burden should focus on prevention in high-burden populations, improving data collection and ensuring access to medical care."

"To the letter vs the spirit: A case analysis of contrasting environmental management responses Sustainability; Environmental Management Systems; Eco-Management and Audit Scheme Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine why firms governed by the same environmental management standards within an industry exhibit contrasting responses, with some adhering to the letter and others achieving the spirit behind the standards. Design/methodology/approach: Using Arena et al. (2010) as an analytical schema to examine the institutional dynamics behind such contrasting responses, the paper analyses archival and interview data relating to firm strategy, control technology and human expertise in two contrasting Australian forestry firms. Findings: The embedding and decoupling of environmental standards with a firmâ€™s environmental management practices is influenced, first, by the extent to which founder directors and senior management integrate environmental responsibility with the underlying business motives and, second, by the use of organisational beliefs and values systems to institutionalise the integrated strategic rationality throughout the firm. Finally, informed by the institutionalised strategic rationality, the participation and expertise of actors across the organisational hierarchy determine the level to which the design and execution of the eco-control technologies move beyond merely monitoring compliance, and act to facilitate continuous improvement, knowledge integration and organisational learning at the operational level. Originality/value: This paper responds to institutional theoristsâ€™ call for a holistic explanation that considers the interactions among several intra-organisational factors to explain the dynamics behind why some firms decouple while others do not, even though the firms exist in the same social and regulatory context."
"Nutrients and metals interactions between water and sediment phases: An urban river case study Sediment Contamination; Trace Metal; China Nutrients and metals interactions between water and sediments were investigated using multiple data analysis approaches. The provision of water to meet the needs of an ever increasing urban population is a significant challenge. This is because urban receiving waters are constantly at risk from pollutant inputs via stormwater runoff and wastewater discharge. This research study employed multiple approaches including principal component analysis, Bayesian Networks (BNs)modelling and geospatial analysis to identify patterns in the distributions of nutrients and metals in water and sediments in an urban river and the interactions between the two phases. In both, water and sediments, nutrient concentrations/loads varied in the order of total carbon (TC)> total nitrogen (TN)> total phosphorus (TP). The river sediments were found to contain the highest crustal metal loads, while in water, the marine-related metals had the highest concentrations. The BNs modelling of pollutant interactions between water and sediment phases indicated that nitrogen is more likely to be transferred from water to sediment than the opposite, while anthropogenic metals are more likely to be transferred from sediments to water. Further, geospatial analysis showed that TN, crustal metals and anthropogenic metal loads in sediments increased from upstream to downstream, while having a decreasing pattern in water. However, marine-related metals in both, water and sediments had increasing concentrations/loads from upstream to downstream. These spatial patterns are attributed to the interactions between water and sediment phases, sediment transport along the river and seawater intrusion in the estuarine area. The study outcomes are expected to contribute to enhancing the knowledge required for developing mitigation strategies to improve urban receiving water quality."
"Challenges and Current Status of the Biological Treatment of PFAS-Contaminated Soils Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are Synthetic Organic Compounds (SOCs) which are of current concern as they are linked to a myriad of adverse health effects in mammals. They can be found in drinking water, rivers, groundwater, wastewater, household dust, and soils. In this review, the current challenge and status of bioremediation of PFAs in soils was examined. While several technologies to remove PFAS from soil have been developed, including adsorption, filtration, thermal treatment, chemical oxidation/reduction and soil washing, these methods are expensive, impractical for in situ treatment, use high pressures and temperatures, with most resulting in toxic waste. Biodegradation has the potential to form the basis of a cost-effective, large scale in situ remediation strategy for PFAS removal from soils. Both fungal and bacterial strains have been isolated that are capable of degrading PFAS; however, to date, information regarding the mechanisms of degradation of PFAS is limited. Through the application of new technologies in microbial ecology, such as stable isotope probing, metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics there is the potential to examine and identify the biodegradation of PFAS, a process which will underpin the development of any robust PFAS bioremediation technology."

"Family decision-making in an emerging market: Tensions with tradition Children's Rights; Childhood; Children with Disabilities We explore the role of the extended family on family decision-making in the context of a high-involvement purchase decision in an emerging economy. Adopting a grounded theory approach, we conducted 33 in-depth interviews with 11 families across Vietnam, including both nuclear and extended family members. Our findings demonstrate that parents retain a significant, albeit evolving, role in the consumption decision-making of their adult children, acting as a facilitator, cultural mentor and/or patriarch. However, these roles, coupled with the broader macro-environmental transformation, have contributed to two key tensions with tradition for the younger generation: respecting and deferring to their parents versus fulfilling their own aspirations fuelled by socio-economic change; and, for women in particular, achieving a greater voice in decision-making versus adhering to the culturally entrenched norms of a patriarchal society."

"Nitrogen fertilizer is a key factor affecting the soil chemical and microbial communities in a mollisol Acidobacterium; Chloroflexi; Microbial Communities Microbial communities drive geochemical cycles in soils. Relatively few studies have assessed the long-term impacts of different types of soil amendments under field conditions in long-term experiments. The response of soil microbial organisms in a Mollisol cultivated with maize for 35 years was examined. Treatments involved the use of N, P, and K fertilizers and two doses of straw residue in isolation or combined. Real-time PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing methods were used to characterize the microbial community. The results showed that addition of nitrogen fertilizers decreased soil pH, but this was mitigated when a high dose of straw was also incorporated. Long-term application of inorganic fertilizers was able to alter the abundance of functional soil microbial population. Application of inorganic N fertilizer resulted in distinctive changes on N-cycle microorganisms. Phosphate-solubilizing functional genes abundance was lower in plots with no phosphate fertilizer. Sequencing analysis showed that the presence or absence of N in the fertilizer mix is a key factor affecting bacterial community diversity of agricultural soil, and pH, total organic C, and total N show a high correlation with bacterial community composition. Nitrogen addition increased the N concentration in the soil, which could cause changes in the soil pH and change the soil bacterial community. Our findings proved that interaction of N fertilizer with other fertilizers can affect microbial communities."

"Preventing child sexual abuse: A systematic review of interventions and their efficacy in developing countries Adverse Childhood Experiences; Maltreatment; Child Abuse Background: Research on prevalence, risk factors, and prevention interventions for child sexual abuse has continued to focus on western and developed countries. Where country-level prevalence data or large-scale research exists, rates of child sexual abuse are consistently higher in developing and non-western countries than their western and developed counterparts. Objective: We systematically reviewed research on the nature of child sexual abuse interventions in developing countries, the settings and populations included to identify types of child sexual abuse prevention initiatives being implemented in developing countries and their effectiveness. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of six databases and identified eight studies to include in our analysis. Results: Most empirically evaluated interventions in developing countries have focused on preschool and primary school-aged children. Most have focused on interventions delivered in educational settings, with a lack of focus on population-level interventions to prevent child sexual abuse. Researchers have used outcomes measuring knowledge or skills for young people in self-protection and help-seeking, not deployment of those skills, actual reduction in prevalence of CSA, or improvements in conditions of safety in organizational contexts. Conclusions: If the focus on school-based strategies to prevent child sexual abuse continues in developing countries, a significant gap in knowledge of the efficacy of population-level interventions outside of school contexts, and consistency across the application of interventions will remain. Evaluations are needed that address the efficacy of broader government-led or whole-of-community prevention interventions to reduce actual prevalence of child sexual abuse, or that can link increased knowledge and skill with reduced victimization."

"Sensitivity of a Large and Representative Sample of Antarctic Marine Invertebrates to Metals Toxicity; Aquatic Organisms; Environmental Assessment There are limited data on the sensitivity to contaminants of marine organisms in polar regions. Consequently, assessments of the risk of contaminants to marine biota in polar environments typically include extrapolations from temperate and/or tropical species. This is problematic because the taxonomic composition of organisms differs between polar and temperate/tropical waters, and both the toxicity of chemicals and the physiology of organisms are very different at the stable low temperatures experienced in polar marine systems. Collecting high-quality sensitivity data for a wide range of marine polar organisms using traditional toxicity assessment approaches is a time-consuming and difficult process, especially in remote and hostile environments. We applied a rapid toxicity testing approach, which allowed a much larger number of species to be tested than would be possible with traditional toxicity test methods, albeit with lower replications and fewer exposure concentrations. With this rapid approach, sensitivity estimates are less precise, but more numerous. This is important when constructing species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), which aim to represent the sensitivity of communities. We determined the approximate sensitivity (4- and 10-d median lethal concentration [LC50] values) of a large and representative sample of Antarctic marine invertebrates to copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd). Up to 88 LC50 values (from 88 different taxa) were used in the construction of SSDs. The hazardous concentrations for 1% of taxa (HC1) based on 10-d LC50 values were 37, 346, and 792 Î¼g/L for Cu, Zn, and Cd, respectively. Our results provide a basis for estimating the risk of exposure to metals for a large representative sample of marine polar invertebrates. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1560â€“1568. Â© 2019 SETAC."

"Nonlinear characterization of a Rossler system under periodic closed-loop control via time-frequency and bispectral analysis Bispectrum; Higher-order Statistics; Digital Signal Processing This study has two primary objectives; they are to investigate the nonlinear interactions (or quadratic phase-coupling) in a chaotic Rossler system under periodic closed-loop control via wavelet bispectral analysis; and to further identify the component mechanisms of synchronization. It is observed that a fixed-gain, fixed-frequency controller produces quadratic phase-coupling and decoupling along lines of constant frequency and that are perpendicular to the diagonal of the bicoherence matrix. Further, it was also observed that for synchronization to occur, both frequency entrainment and quadratic phase-coupling must be present. It was found that forcing the Rossler system with a constant frequency did not reduce the amplitude of the resulting period-1 orbit at sufficiently high gains. For the controller with a fixed gain and time-varying error signal, it was found that the time varying forcing frequency (adjusted by an extremum seeking feedback loop) linearizes the Rossler system and in doing so, suppresses the phase coherence completely. The time-varying forcing frequency removes the conditions for frequency entrainment by providing broadband attenuation; the result is suppression without synchronization."

"Effect of Freeze–Thaw Cycles on Mechanical and Microstructural Properties of Tailings Reinforced with Cement-Based Material Frost Resistance; Freeze Thawing; Thaw In China, more than 10,000 Tailings storage facilities (TSF) have been created on the ground surface through mineral mining processes, these TSF occupy a large amount of land. The strength of the tailings is too low to be able to stand on its own without strengthening. In order to save land resources and alleviate the damage to the environment caused by mineral mining, it is necessary to reinforce the TSF so that they can store more tailings. China is one of the countries with the largest area of permafrost and seasonal frozen regions, accounting for about 75% of the countryâ€™s total land area. The problem can be exacerbated in these regions where the freezeâ€“thaw effect can further degrade the strength of tailings. A review of the literature suggests that there is little research on the mechanical and microstructural properties of tailings reinforced with cement-based materials under freezeâ€“thaw conditions, especially when the tailings are to be discharged to land for sustainable development. This study investigates the effect of freezeâ€“thaw cycles on the mechanical properties and microstructural changes of tailings reinforced with cement-based materials to mitigate environmental hazards. Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests, scanning electron microscopic images, X-Ray Diffraction tests, thermogravimetry tests and mercury intrusion porosimetry tests were conducted on samples of tailings. The results from this study show that freezeâ€“thaw cycles reduce the UCS of all the tested samples eventually, but the frozen temperature does not significantly affect the UCS. The larger number of freezeâ€“thaw cycles, the more damage is to the surface morphology and the matrix of the tailings. The results presented in the paper can help engineers and managers to effectively transport the TSF to other locations to minimize environmental hazards to achieve sustainable production of mineral mining processes."

"Invasive weed species’ threats to global biodiversity: Future scenarios of changes in the number of invasive species in a changing climate Maximum Entropy; Ecosystem; Environmental Space Invasive weed species (IWS) threaten ecosystems, the distribution of specific plant species, as well as agricultural productivity. Predicting the impact of climate change on the current and future distributions of these unwanted species forms an important category of ecological research. Our study investigated 32 globally important IWS to assess whether climate alteration may lead to spatial changes in the overlapping of specific IWS globally. We utilized the versatile species distribution model MaxEnt, coupled with Geographic Information Systems, to evaluate the potential alterations (gain/loss/static) in the number of potential ecoregion invasions by IWS, under four Representative Concentration Pathways, which differ in terms of predicted year of peak greenhouse gas emission. We based our projection on a forecast of climatic variables (extracted from WorldClim) from two global circulation models (CCSM4 and MIROC-ESM). Initially, we modeled current climatic suitability of habitat, individually for each of the 32 IWS, identifying those with a common spatial range of suitability. Thereafter, we modeled the suitability of all 32 species under the projected climate for 2050, incorporating each of the four Representative Concentration Pathways (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) in separate models, again examining the common spatial overlaps. The discrimination capacity and accuracy of the model were assessed for all 32 IWS individually, using the area under the curve and true skill statistic rate, with results averaging 0.87 and 0.75 respectively, indicating a high level of accuracy. Our final methodological step compared the extent of the overlaps and alterations under the current and future projected climates. Our results mainly predicted decrease on a global scale, in areas of habitat suitable for most IWS, under future climatic conditions, excluding European countries, northern Brazil, eastern US, and south-eastern Australia. The following should be considered when interpreting these results: there are many inherent assumptions and limitations in presence-only data of this type, as well as with the modeling techniques projecting climate conditions, and the envelopes themselves, such as scale and resolution mismatches, dispersal barriers, lack of documentation on potential disturbances, and unknown or unforeseen biotic interactions."

"The “Gender Agenda” in Agriculture for Development and Its (Lack of) Alignment With Feminist Scholarship Farmers; Women in Agriculture; Farm Families Sustainable food systems require sustainable agriculture. To achieve this, we argue, inclusive approaches are required that incorporate the voices and lived experiences of diverse social groups. In agriculture-based international development efforts (known as Agriculture for Development or A4D), it is increasingly being recognized that sustainable agriculture requires attention to gendered power relations. In the past, gender inequality has been a major barrier to developing inclusive, sustainable food systems, and continues to be so today. At the same time, however, gender is increasingly â€œon the agendaâ€ in A4D. Yet what sort of agenda is being promoted and to what extent does it reflect progress in feminist scholarship? We examine the burgeoning â€œgender agendaâ€ through the lens of policy materials produced by prominent A4D organizations. In doing so, we find problematic narratives that instrumentalise women in the name of sustainable agricultural development. However, we also find other more transformative discourses that, in troubling the drivers of gender inequality and promoting shared responsibility for change, reflect a deeper awareness of feminist scholarship. In any effort to advance sustainable agriculture, further progress is needed to address the myriad ways gender pervades not just development settings but development institutions and donor nations, and contributes to the production of as well as responses to global A4D challenges."

"Optimizing the energy consumption in a residential building at different climate zones: Towards sustainable decision making Walls (Structural Partitions); Hot Temperature; Insulation Electricity dependent heating-cooling (H/C) system has increased rapidly to provide thermal comfort to the occupants. H/C is a major source of energy consumption in residential buildings around the world. Studies revealed that the thermal properties of building materials are converted into the same unit as thermal resistance (R) in the USA, Canada, The UK, Australia, and other countries. However, none of the previous studies have considered the adaptation of national insulation codes to reduce electricity cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the correlations of energy consumption (Q) to thermal resistances (R) of the building envelop (A). Therefore, this study attempts to review the optimum energy consumption of a selected house due to H/C at different choices of national code standardized R values. Accurate envelop areas (A) of the selected house components are estimated by applying the Autodesk Revit Building Information Model (BIM) to use in the energy model. The case study critically evaluates the variation of electricity cost, GHG emissions, and selection of the optimized thermostat settings for energy savings in different climatic regions and seasons of a year. Different correlations are obtained using risk analysis software on energy consumptions with code recognized arrays of insulations. This sensitivity analysis result shows that the corelation coefficient of energy consumption with medium-low insulated building envelop (r = 0.44) is more significant than improved, maximum, medium-high, and minimum insulations (r = 0.14â€“0.29) which indicates the insulation range where more emphasis should be put to get an optimized solution. Thus the developed analytical framework supports inclusive decision-making by selecting appropriate kinds of insulation for the design of a sustainable house."

"Image-based sexual abuse: A feminist criminological approach Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica Contemporary digital society and culture can be characterized by an obsession with both the visual artifact and object. This is evidenced through contemporary voyeurism trends, such as reality television, live streaming, amateur pornography, as well as an increasing demand for â€œrealâ€ or â€œauthenticâ€ visual representations. In addition and related to these contemporary social trends, there is a continual shifting public/private divide, an ongoing fixation on bodies, particularly feminized bodies, as well as pre-existing structural inequalities on the basis of gender, race, sexuality, class, age, and ability. This complex interplay of social, cultural, and technological factors provides the contextual backdrop to understanding the prevalence, nature, and perpetration related to the taking and sharing non-consensual nude or sexual imagery - also known as image-based sexual abuse (IBSA). Further to structural factors underlying IBSA, it is also important to address the performativity of gender and subjectivity in understanding this phenomenon and thereby contribute to more informed responses and prevention interventions. In this chapter, we utilize feminist criminological theory for understanding the complex interplay of individual and structural causes of IBSA."

"Microplastic contamination has limited effects on coral fertilisation and larvae Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Microplastics are ubiquitous throughout the world's oceans and contaminate coral reef ecosystems. There is evidence of microplastic ingestion by corals and passive contact with coral tissues, causing adverse health effects that include energy expenditure for particle removal from the tissue surface, as well as reduced growth, tissue bleaching, and necrosis. Here, it was examined whether microplastic contamination impairs the success of gamete fertilisation, embryo development and larval settlement of the reef-building coral Acropora tenuis. Coral gametes and larvae were exposed to fifteen microplastic treatments using two types of plastic: (1) weathered polypropylene particles and (2) spherical polyethylene microbeads. The treatments ranged from five to 50 polypropylene pieces L-1 and 25 to 200 microbeads L-1. Fertilisation was only negatively affected by the largest weathered microplastics (2 mm2), but the effects were not dose dependent. Embryo development and larval settlement were not significantly impacted by either microplastic type. The study shows that moderate-high levels of marine microplastic contamination, specifically particles <2 mm2, will not substantially interfere with the success of critical early life coral processes."

"Financial inclusion and poverty: Micro-level evidence from Nigeria Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion In this chapter, the authors use data from the 2016 Financial Inclusion Insights (FII) program for Nigeria to present new evidence on the effects of financial inclusion on household poverty. The authors add to the discourse on the association between financial inclusion and poverty by examining alternative approaches to measuring both financial inclusion and poverty. The chapter demonstrates that an increase in multi-dimensional financial inclusion, reflecting access to banks, access to credit and access to insurance, is associated with a decline in poverty. Further analysis by the authors show that among the components of financial inclusion, access to a checking, savings or fixed deposit account is more important than access to credit and insurance in reducing poverty."

"Therapeutic cancer vaccines-T cell responses and epigenetic modulation T Lymphocyte; Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus; Effectors There is great interest in developing efficient therapeutic cancer vaccines, as this type of therapy allows targeted killing of tumor cells as well as long-lasting immune protection. High levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells are associated with better prognosis in many cancers, and it is expected that new generation vaccines will induce effective production of these cells. Epigenetic mechanisms can promote changes in host immune responses, as well as mediate immune evasion by cancer cells. Here, we focus on epigenetic modifications involved in both vaccine-adjuvant-generated T cell immunity and cancer immune escape mechanisms. We propose that vaccine-adjuvant systems may be utilized to induce beneficial epigenetic modifications and discuss how epigenetic interventions could improve vaccine-based therapies. Additionally, we speculate on how, given the unique nature of individual epigenetic landscapes, epigenetic mapping of cancer progression and specific subsequent immune responses, could be harnessed to tailor therapeutic vaccines to each patient."

"Development of SiO2-coumarin fluorescent nanohybrid and its application for Cu(II) sensing in aqueous extracts of roadside soil Fluorescence; Rhodamines; Cupric Ion A SiO2-coumarin nanohybrid was investigated for its Cu(II) sensing performance in aqueous media, and in comparison with the Cu(II)-selective coumarin used alone. Fluorescence of both coumarin itself and the nanohybrid, Î»ex/Î»em 435/481 nm, was selectively quenched by Cu(II) when tested against a range of multivalent cations. The nanohybrid had enhanced Cu(II) sensing properties when compared to the coumarin including (i) improved limit of detection from Î¼M-level (0.48 Î¼M) of Cu(II) using coumarin alone to nM-level (0.033 Î¼M) and (ii) an extended linear detection range of 0.033â€“260 Î¼M (0.0005â€“4.1 mg/mL) Cu(II) compared to 0.48â€“55 Î¼M for the coumarin itself. The lower limit of detection and extended range were achieved with a smaller amount of coumarin and no traces of organic solvents used to help coumarin dissolution. Characterization suggested that under applied test conditions at pH = 5, SiO2 nanoparticles with negative surface charges adsorbed coumarin and then (when present) Cu(II) ions. The SiO2-coumarin nanohybrid was then applied for the determination of Cu(II) levels in aqueous soil extracts reaching over 94% recovery rates when used against the standard soil analysis method by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

"Site-Selective Coordination Assembly of Dynamic Metal-Phenolic Networks Mussel Adhesive Protein; Catechols; Adhesion Coordination states of metal-organic materials are known to dictate their physicochemical properties and applications in various fields. However, understanding and controlling coordination sites in metal-organic systems is challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis of site-selective coordinated metal-phenolic networks (MPNs) using flavonoids as coordination modulators. The site-selective coordination was systematically investigated experimentally and computationally using ligands with one, two, and multiple different coordination sites. Tuning the multimodal Fe coordination with catechol, carbonyl, and hydroxyl groups within the MPNs enabled the facile engineering of diverse physicochemical properties including size, selective permeability (20â€“2000 kDa), and pH-dependent degradability. This study expands our understanding of metal-phenolic chemistry and provides new routes for the rational design of structurally tailorable coordination-based materials."

"Life cycle performance of Cross Laminated Timber mid-rise residential buildings in Australia Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Engineering wood products have significant potential as a sustainable alternative for concrete and steel in construction. Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) can add value to conventional timber products due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, simple installation, aesthetic features and environmental benefits. Recent changes in the national construction code permit structural timber buildings with a height of up to 25m, which demonstrates the strong commitment of the construction industry to adopt more sustainable practices. This paper aims to compare life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (LCGHGE) and life cycle cost (LCC) of CLT and reinforced concrete (RC) in identical midrise residential buildings in three most populated cities in Australia. It has shown that the CLT building has 30 % less LCGHGE compared with the RC building over a life span of 50 years in Melbourne, and 34% and 29% reduction in LCGHCE in Sydney and Brisbane, respectively. The results from LCC analysis showed that CLT building is 1.3% lower than conventional RC in Melbourne, and 0.9% lower in Sydney and Brisbane. The initial and end of life phases reflected reductions in LCGHGE and LCC for the CLT building whilst the operation phase incurred higher values. The extended service life of buildings has a major impact on the operational phase while changes in the discount rate have strong effects on the lifecycle operational and maintenance costs. Overall the CLT building outperformed the RC building in terms of LCGHGE and LCC across three cities. However, further savings in the operational phase with energy efficient methodologies and reuse or recycling of timber products at the end of life of the building can reinforce CLT as a sustainable alternative to RC construction."
"The gendered nature of the risk factors of the COVID-19 pandemic and gender equality: A literature review from a vulnerability perspective Reproductive Health; Abortion; COVID-19 The risk factors of COVID-19 are not gender-neutral but gendered. A vulnerability approach to pandemics suggests that females are more prone to risk exposure while there are inequalities in accessing resources and opportunities. These inequalities create a gendered pandemic vul-nerability. The current article addresses the specific vulnerability on the gendered risk factors en-countered by girls and women due to the gendered pandemic in a global context and their impacts on gender inequality. This study analyses the existing literature on the gendered pandemic and risk factors on females that lead to gender inequality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study adopts a vulnerability approach to the pandemic as an analytical concept. Our findings from the systematic literature review suggest that womenâ€™s pre-existing vulnerabilities are exacerbated in the wake of the pandemic due to the gendered risk factors worsening the gender equality gap. We con-clude by arguing that our studyâ€™s finding supports a vulnerability approach to disasters."

"Interdisciplinarity for social justice enterprise: intersecting education, industry and community arts perspectives Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work The role of interdisciplinarity in achieving authentic and transformative learning outcomes is both contested and complex. At the same time, traditional disciplinary ways of being, doing and knowing have been further tested by the impact of COVID-19 on students, schools and communities. In Tasmania, already experiencing amongst the lowest levels of educational attainment in Australia, the educational implications of COVID-19 have been polarising. Preliminary reports have employed interdisciplinary perspectives to understand how the situation is unfolding. Extremes of privilege and poverty have intensified, with accentuated disadvantage experienced by already vulnerable groups, whilst ingenuity, adaptability and innovation have flourished elsewhere. The spectrum and range of this polarisation yield compelling evidence for the inadequate address of complex societal problems through singular disciplines or institutions. This article explores storied data generated from the intersections of interdisciplinary strategy enacted across three settings: education, creative industries and community-based arts practice. The data derive from two Tasmanian case studies where interdisciplinary collaboration between the education sector, creative industries and community is well established. In subsequent discussion, the multidisciplinary authorship team make and offer meaning from participatory lived experiences of pursuing social justice outcomes prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. From this, we posit how lived experiences of interdisciplinarity impact social justice enterprise in times of increasingly complex socio-economic challenge. In addressing these concerns, we elucidate the role interdisciplinarity plays in both enabling and inhibiting social justice imperatives shared across education, creative industry and community-based arts practice immediately prior to and during a global pandemic. In so doing, we elicit the ways interdisciplinary practices, partnerships and priorities recalibrate in response to global challenges."

"Expectations and realities of digital public spaces: A case study of digital community engagement in Melbourne, Australia Open Government; Transparency; E-Governance This article analyses expectations and experiences of digital public spaces that facilitate community engagement with urban planning. While viewing digital spaces as part of an expanding repertoire of public spaces and events â€“ physical and digital â€“ that signify theparticipatory turn in municipal governance, we argue that local officials and residents are overly optimistic about the democratic and administrative capacities of the digital sphere. Through a case study from Melbourne, Australia â€“ a city with significant growth pressures â€“ we argue that the experience of new participatory digital platforms falls short of expectations, for both residents and officials. Data show that well-documented problems with established modes of community engagement such as agenda control and â€˜black boxingâ€™ of responses, are replicated in on-line settings. The wariness residents have of administrators and elected officials are overlaid by new concerns of digital distrust and digital exclusion. For officials, using these digital spaces effectively requires time to develop and apply new skills. Our study suggests that digital spaces are not homogenous but are made up of diverse and complex practices and interrelationships The multiplex relationships making up these digital spaces suggest that strategic and contextual combinations of online and offline engagement may be a path towards inclusive and democratic community engagement."

We construct a multidimensional indicator of financial inclusion and examine the effects of financial inclusion on multiple measures of poverty including the household Poverty Probability Index (PPI), household deprivation scores, and poverty line. We find that financial inclusion has a strong poverty-reducing effect. This finding is consistent across the different measures of poverty used, and alternative ways of measures financial inclusion. These results underpin the importance of financial inclusion and the need for its promotion across countries."

"Exploring blockchain for sustainability in the food supply chain: An affordance approach Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices For sustainable development, supply chains need to simultaneously pursue economic, social, and environmental sustainability goals, collectively known as the triple bottom line (TBL). Touted as a disruptive technology for supply chains to attain sustainability, blockchain had a slow and patchy diffusion. This research-in-progress paper explores how food supply chains (FSCs) can develop affordances from blockchain to address critical challenges and improve the TBL performance. It proposes a conceptual model, based on affordance-actualization theory, linking sustainability critical success factors in the FSC to blockchain-enabled affordances and the resulting TBL improvements. The study offers modest contributions to theory by linking affordances with TBL improvement in the FSC which guides future research in exploring how a blockchain-enabled FSC pursues sustainable development."

"Energy poverty, temperature and climate change Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort We examine the effect of temperature shocks on the proclivity to be in energy poverty and combine our estimates with simulated weather data to predict the effect of global warming on the incidence of energy poverty over the rest of the century. To do so, we match representative household panel data for Australia with weather data at a geographically localized level. We find that each additional â€˜cold dayâ€™ (average temperature below 15 Â°C) increases the incidence of energy poverty by 0.01%â€“0.03%, compared to if the day had been in the comfortable temperature range (20-24 Â°C). We find that global warming can be expected to result in modest decreases in the extent of energy poverty in the short-medium and long-run. Most studies have emphasized the economic and social costs of climate change. Our findings are important in pointing to a specific outcome for which climate change may be beneficial for a large country with a relatively mild climate."
"How are gender inequality and violence against women related? Findings from a population-level community attitudes survey Child Care; Time Use; Domestic Division of Labour Low support for gender equality (GE) predicts attitudes supporting violence against women (VAW). However, little is known about the influence of attitudes toward different manifestations of GE. This study extends knowledge by assessing the relative strength of attitudes to GE across seven theoretically derived dimensions, and their association with attitudes toward VAW. 17,542 Australians participated in the 2017 National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women Survey. Population means were calculated for the following scales formed from survey questions: the Community Attitudes Supportive of Violence Against Women Scale (CASVAWS), the Gender Equality Attitudes Scale (GEAS) and measures within the GEAS representing the theoretical dimensions. There was variation in support for GE between the measures. The lower the support for GE, the higher the support for VAW. Although all GEAS measures included in regression modelling contributed to variance in the CASVAWS, two accounted for more than half. The study suggests benefits in using a multidimensional model of GE to mitigate cultural support for VAW, with emphasis on the private sphere and countering hostility toward women and rigid gender roles and identities."

The Poetic Kinaesthetic Interface project (PKI) engages with this problematic directly. In PKI we use unfolding processesâ€”informed by participatory, speculative and critical designâ€”in emergent actions, to design towards unknown outcomes, using unknown materials. The impossibility of this task is proving as useful as it is disruptive. At its most potent, it is destabilising expectations, aesthetics and processes. Keeping the researchers, collaborators and participants in a state of unknowing, is opening the research potential to far-ranging possibilities. In this article we unpack the motivations driving the PKI project. We present our mixed-methodology, which entangles textile crafts, design interactions and materiality to shape an embodied enquiry. Our research outcomes are procedural and methodological. PKI brings together diverse human, non-human, known and unknown actors to discover where the emergent assemblages might lead. Our approach is re-invigoratingâ€”as it demands re-envisioning ofâ€”the design process."

"The regulation of learning and co-creation of new knowledge in mobile learning Self-Regulated Learning; Metacognition; Self-Control Mobile devices as learning tools enrich mobile computer supported collaborative learning (mCSCL). Engaging in metacognitive interaction promotes students' regulatory learning and this can provide a positive influence to learning outcomes. However, despite insightful empirical studies, there is no research into the actual processes of new knowledge creation in this context. This leads to the question of how mobile learning experiences can support the co-creation of new knowledge. Two classroom action research studies were carried out using a qualitative research approach. The analysis of the mobile messages using conversation analysis indicates that self-regulated learning in mCSCL is non-linear, defying existing theory. The findings also show that learners find ways to self-regulate learning activities in socially stimulated learning environments. Through knowledge sharing, students seek new insights into the learning instead of mere transfer of existing content. The Strategic Cocreation of New Knowledge in mCSCL Model has been developed providing innovative ways to approach mobile learning. The findings also comprise improved descriptive models in cross-boundary learning. This research is significant as emerging elements encourage instructors to rethink and design better mobile learning activities to optimize learning. Three recommendations are made and if implemented, will enable learning facilitators to achieve enhanced learning outcomes, engage learners better and improve learning experiences."

"Decoupling anthropogenic vs. natural impacts at a wastewater treatment plant situated on acid sulfate soils Acid Sulfate Soil; Wetlands; Acid Volatile Sulfides Decoupling natural and anthropogenic impacts on the subsurface environment can be difficult, particularly when it has been subject to a wide range of influences over time and space. In this work we show how the use of hydrogeochemical plotting tools, time-series analysis of key contaminants of concern, and targeted isotopic analysis can be used to better understand the contamination sources/processes in a complex environment â€“ a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) located on coastal acid sulfate soils (ASS). Analysis of soil profiles for potential oxidisable sulfur, acid neutralising capacity (ANC), and pHfox along with groundwater chemistry, revealed that oxidation of pyritic sediments, initially deposited during the mid-Holocene, have led to significant pH declines and the secondary mobilisation of metals into the groundwater environment. This is further complicated by historic anthropogenic inputs associated with the WWTP (e.g., effluent leakages) and the surrounding agricultural land uses. There is distinct separation between spatial and temporal trends in the nutrient and heavy metals data in groundwater, suggesting these reflect different contaminant sources and/or processes. Isotopic data indicate nutrients are largely derived from the WWTP, whereas time-series analysis of key contaminants of concern and hydrogeochemical plotting tools indicate metals are largely derived from the secondary mobilisation of ASS due to acidity generated during sulfide oxidation. This work highlights the importance of understanding the hydrogeological environment and need for careful planning and ongoing management of WWTP sites, particularly those constructed on potential acid sulfate soils (PASS), which, if disturbed or exposed, can lead to impacts beyond the area of ASS via groundwater discharge to nearby surface water bodies (in this case the site is adjacent to a Ramsar-listed wetland). The outcomes of this work have significant global application in the identification, assessment, and control of ASS, the practice of contaminant source attribution, and the siting and design of future WWTPs, which will continue to be sited in coastal areas to meet population needs."

"Homelessness and Incarceration: A Reciprocal Relationship? Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease Objectives: Examine whether exits from incarceration lead to homelessness and whether homelessness leads to incarceration. Methods: This paper uses a unique longitudinal dataset which follows disadvantaged Australians over 2.5 years and provides very detailed information on their housing circumstances. Although studies consistently report a positive association between incarceration and homelessness, little is known about the causal relationship between them. We advance in that direction by exploiting the longitudinal dimension of our data in two ways: (i) employing individual fixed effects models to deal with time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity; (ii) lagging key independent variables to minimise reverse causality issues. Results: Our results show that homelessness does not increase the risk of incarceration. In contrast, incarceration does increase the probability that an individual will become homeless, but not immediately. Exploiting details of the accommodation calendar 1-24 months after release, we find a modest immediate effect of incarceration on homelessness (a 3 percentage points increase), which increases 6 months after release (to around 12 percentage points) and persists for a further 11 months with respondents most often staying in precarious housing arrangements (boarding houses or with friends with no alternative) rather than becoming literally homelessness. Conclusions: Our study shows the importance of having adequate coverage for post-release programs to break the link between incarceration and homelessness. Specifically, we find that the critical period for ex-inmates starts 6 months after release suggesting that this may be the time when support programs are currently lacking and would be most efficient."
"Critical factors influencing the intention to adopt m-government services by the elderly Technology Acceptance Model; Mobile Payment; E-Learning While the elderly population is growing rapidly, acceptance and use of m-government services by them are far below expectation. Previous studies on acceptance and use of m-government services have predominantly focused on younger citizens with skills and experience of information technologies. Drawing upon the dual factor model, this study investigates the enablers and inhibitors of the elderly's m-government service adoption behavior. Four constructs from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), namely, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence; and self-actualization are treated as enablers, while user resistance to change, technology anxiety, and declining physiological conditions are regarded as inhibitors. Results show that adoption of m-government by the elderly is significantly influenced by all tested enablers and inhibitors, except for social influence. This study contributes by providing an integrative model of technology acceptance for the elderly along with practical implications for policy makers."

"Plant trait-environment trends and their conservation implications for riparian wetlands in the Yellow River Ecosystem; Plant Communities; Ecosystem Stability Determining the relationship between plant functional traits and the environment are key for the protection and sustainable utilization of riparian wetlands. In the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, riparian wetlands are divided into seasonal floodplain wetlands (natural) and pond-like wetlands or paddy fields (artificial). Here, species composition differences were catalogued based on plant functional traits including origin, life history, and wetland affinity in natural and artificial wetlands. Wetland physicochemical characteristics and regional socio-economic parameters collected as indicators of environmental variables were used to analyze the plant functional trait-environment relationship. The results reveal that plant functional traits in the seasonal floodplain wetland are impacted by physicochemical characteristics of habitat. The abundance of annual plants tends to decrease with concentration of heavy metals, while species diversity is mainly determined by soil physical and chemical properties, especially soil pH and temperature. Specifically, wetland-obligate species (not in water) are more resistant to heavy metal content in water than species with other types of wetland affinity. Life history strategies of species in artificial sites tend to be significantly associated with animal husbandry and artificial populations, while the wetland affinity of species is mainly determined by regional agriculture, especially the installation of agricultural covered areas. Furthermore, water quality and nutrients in suspended sediments from the Yellow River affected species diversity and life history strategies by affecting water and soil conditions of surrounding wetlands, especially conductivity and phosphorus levels."
"Dual-Band Two-Sided Beam Generation Utilizing an EBG-Based Periodically Modulated Metasurface Broadsides; Antenna; Reactance We propose a periodically modulated metasurface (MTS) capable of producing two-sided electromagnetic (EM) beams with frequency-controlled beam reconfiguration. The beam-forming functionality is realized through the leaky-wave (LW) conditions of the periodic structure, and the beam reconfiguration at quadrature azimuth angle is triggered by switching between the two operating frequencies. The MTS is formed using a periodic homogeneous array of split ring resonators (SRRs) with anisotropic characteristics. The EM bandgap (EBG) properties and LW conditions of the individual SRRs are combined to produce both beam-forming and beam-reconfiguration functionalities. The subwavelength SRR unit cells are designed such that they satisfy LW theory at 1.8 GHz to form a two-sided beam along azimuth angles 0Â° and 180Â° and create a complete EBG at 2.6 GHz to form a two-sided beam along angles 90Â° and 270Â° at 2.6 GHz. Both the TE and TM mode responses of the individual SRRs are taken into consideration during the design process. The MTS structure is synthesized and evaluated using full-wave EM simulator and is validated with the experimental results."
"Theoretical issues and political dilemmas in working with men Young; Sex Education; Sexuality This chapter discusses the theoretical issues and political dilemmas involved in working with men in the human services. The main theoretical framework that informs work with men in the human services is sex role theory. The sex role approach to masculinity utilises the theoretical ideas underlying liberal feminism, wherein womenâ€™s disadvantages are said to result from stereotypical customary expectations, internalised by both men and women. In some feminist social work texts, however, all men are seen as a coherent â€˜gender classâ€™ with the same vested interests in controlling women. When men work with men it is important that they recognise the kinship with fellow men. However, the common elements that exist between male workers and male clients present a number of problems. Work with men in the human services should be one aspect of a broader strategy for changing unequal power relations between women and men."

"Mapping the knowledge domain of stakeholder perspective studies in construction projects: A bibliometric approach Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management Construction projects require the effective collaboration among the various types of stakeholders involved to succeed, thus leading to stakeholder perspective studies in construction projects. The study proposes an integrated bibliometric approach to detect the knowledge evolution, domain and frontier with a broader searching scope compared with manual review. A total of 752 peer-reviewed academic papers published until the end of 2017 are used. The knowledge evolution indicates seven milestones in history, namely, stakeholder concept, method, identification, assessment, management, influence and complexity. The identified knowledge domain consists of four major research areas which are society, sustainability, analytical tool and project management. The knowledge frontier is also revealed, including a dearth of detailed discussions on stakeholder engagement in sustainable urban projects, lack of generalisation of stakeholder studies in complex construction projects, limited application of dynamic and simulation stakeholder analysis in uncertain project environment and few instant and accurate approaches to integrate stakeholder information. The study provides a holistic knowledge map for the past, current and future of stakeholder perspective studies in construction projects."

"Household coping behavior and its contribution to resilience to global macroeconomic shocks in Vanuatu and Solomon Islands Climate Change; Decision to Migrate; Small Islands This paper examines the resilience of households in Vanuatu and Solomon Islandsâ€”two small island developing states in Melanesia renowned for their vulnerabilitiesâ€”to the adverse effects of global macroeconomic shocks. The focus is on the spike in international food and fuel prices in 2008 and the subsequent shock to global demand, known as the Global Economic Crisis (GEC). Using a unique retrospective cross-section survey, the results show that experience of these shocks was widespread across urban and rural areas. Households with more education, access to income-generating activitiesâ€”particularly in the informal sectorâ€”and greater wealth were best placed to withstand a deterioration in their well-being, measured as a fall in self-reported disposable income. Households also employed a variety of coping strategies in response to the shocks. Local food gardens and informal insurance are seen as key safety nets in times of stress, yet neither provided full insurance from the shocks. Some households, particularly in urban areas, employed harmful coping strategies, such as reducing spending on health, education, and food. While potentially effective in withstanding a temporary fall in disposable income, these responses are likely to weaken overall resilience and leave households vulnerable to future shocks."

"‘Put some balls on that woman’: Gendered repertoires of inequality in screen composers’ careers Cultural Economy; Freelancer; Art This study contributes to debates about gendered career outcomes in the creative industries using data collected in interviews with Australian screen composers. We identify how gendered inequalities are legitimated through professional norms by comparing the responses of screen composers on barriers to womenâ€™s advancement. The article explores how three distinct interpretive repertoires help reproduce the gender inequality regime present in the screen composition field. These repertoires are â€˜art vs. equalityâ€™, where working towards equality can be framed as antithetical to artistic ideals; â€˜gendered musicâ€™, where men and women are posited as making fundamentally different types of music; and â€˜confidenceâ€™, where men are framed as innately possessing certain entrepreneurial skills vital to success in the creative industries, while women both shoulder the blame for not possessing such skills and recognize the risks inherent for them in performing confidence. By focusing on repertoires, this study describes the means by which gender-based discrimination is made overt and offered justification among screen composers, posing challenges to organizations and individuals seeking to address gender inequality in the profession."

"Investigating the prospects of water desalination using a thermal water pump coupled with reverse osmosis membrane Rankine Cycle; Working Fluids; Waste Heat Utilization This paper presents the design and experimental analysis of a thermal water pump coupled with a reverse osmosis desalination membrane. The operation, thermodynamic cycle and design of the proposed system are explained with the aid of system schematics and thermodynamic process diagrams, while the experimental performance of the thermal water pump in combination with a reverse osmosis membrane is presented and discussed. It is shown that for feed water at a salt concentration of 1184 ppm and a heat source temperature of 86 Â°C, the proposed system is shown to be able to produce fresh water at a rate of 1.27 L/h with a specific energy consumption of 165 MJ/m3. The recovery ratio obtained under these conditions is shown to be 26%. The performance and characteristics of the proposed system are contrasted with data for existing multi-stage thermal desalination systems as well as Rankine cycleâ€“reverse osmosis desalination systems and it is shown to compare favourably to both for low salinity applications."

"The impacts of different biological treatments on the transformation of explosives waste contaminated sludge Trinitrotoluene; Cyclonite; Bioremediation The dinitrotoluene isomers 2,4 and 2,6â€dinitrotoluene (DNT) represent highly toxic, mu-tagenic, and carcinogenic compounds used in explosive manufacturing and in commercial production of polyurethane foam. Bioremediation, the use of microbes to degrade residual DNT in industry wastewaters, represents a promising, low cost and environmentally friendly alternative technology to landfilling. In the present study, the effect of different bioremediation strategies on the degradation of DNT in a microcosmâ€based study was evaluated. Biostimulation of the indigenous microbial community with sulphur phosphate (2.3 g/kg sludge) enhanced DNT transformation (82% trans-formation, from 300 g/L at Day 0 to 55 g/L in week 6) compared to natural attenuation over the same period at 25 Â°C. The indigenous microbial activity was found to be capable of transforming the contaminant, with around 70% transformation of DNT occurring over the microcosm study. 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that while the original bacterial community was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria (30%), the addition of sulphur phosphate significantly increased the abun-dance of Betaproteobacteria by the end of the biostimulation treatment, with the bacterial community dominated by Burkholderia (46%) followed by Rhodanobacter, Acidovorax and Pseudomonas. In summary, the results suggest biostimulation as a treatment choice for the remediation of dinitrotol-uenes and explosives waste."

"Corrosion effects on the granular nano mechanical properties of buried cast iron Hydrogen Embrittlement; Fatigue Crack Growth; Steel Considerable research reported in literature shows that corrosive soil degrades the bulk mechanical properties of buried cast iron pipes due to cracks and degradation of microstructure. The nanomechanical properties of the grains of cast iron pipes can also be affected by the corrosion before bulk mechanical properties. However, the influence of soil corrosivity on the nanomechanical properties at the granular level is remained unresolved to date. This paper addresses this gap and presents the nanomechanical measurements performed on the corroded cast iron specimens and the maximum degradation was quantified. Specimens after 545 days of burial in corrosive soil conditions were tested by nanoindentation for determining the degradation of their nanomechanical properties. The analysis of the test results showed a significant reduction in the nano elastic and nano hardness of the grains of the cast iron due to the diffusion of hydrogen from the surrounding corrosive soil environments. The high corrosion rates were found proportional to inducing the maximum degradation of the nano elastic modulus of the grains. A relation for the prediction of maximum degradation of the nano elastic modulus of the grains as a function of corrosion rates, pH and moisture content of the clay soil was also developed. The finding of the current research is significant as it shows that apart from bulk mechanical properties, the nanomechanical properties of cast iron grains can be degraded by corrosive environments which in turn can affect the service life. Furthermore, understanding the mechanical science of the degradation of the grains can assist in manufacturing sustainable ferrous pipes resistive to corrosion soils."

"Causal inference for the impact of economic policy on financial and labour markets amid the COVID-19 pandemic Financial Markets; Volatility; COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has turned the world upside down since the beginning of 2020, leaving most nations worldwide in both health crises and economic recession. Governments have been continually responding with multiple support policies to help people and businesses overcoming the current situation, from 'Containment', 'Health' to 'Economic' policies, and from local and national supports to international aids. Although the pandemic damage is still not under control, it is essential to have an early investigation to analyze whether these measures have taken effects on the early economic recovery in each nation, and which kinds of measures have made bigger impacts on reducing such negative downturn. Therefore, we conducted a time series based causal inference analysis to measure the effectiveness of these policies, specifically focusing on the 'Economic support' policy on the financial markets for 80 countries and on the United States and Australia labour markets. Our results identified initial positive causal relationships between these policies and the market, providing a perspective for policymakers and other stakeholders."

"The Green School Award in Hong Kong: Development and Impact in the School Sector School Health Services; Well-Being; Health Promotion The Hong Kong Green School Award (HKGSA) is a school award scheme hosted by the Environmental Campaign Committee (ECC) to encourage schools to promote environmental awareness and for students to develop an environmentally-friendly lifestyle. Since its inception in 2000, the HKGSA has undergone several phases of development. Between 2000 to 2008 it took the form of a competition with 3 winning schools and 10 merit schools After an initial review in 2005, it was decided to change the 8th HKGSA from a competition format to a benchmarking process. The successfully accredited schools were given the title of Green School once they fulfilled certain requirements. Another major reform took place in the 12th HKGSA in 2013 to allow flexibility for schools to satisfy the requirements in phases by completing the accreditation to attain the gold award over a period of 3 years, the introduction of facilitators to act as mentors and the enforcing of a maximum validity period for the accreditation. This structure mirrored the sustainable schools program in Victoria, Australia. HKGSA has become a well-received accreditation scheme which can also act as a driving force to promote education for sustainable development in the school sector which in 2020 will be subsumed under the Hong Kong Awards for Environmental Excellence (HKAEE). This chapter describes the development of this initiative in Hong Kong, its framework, implementation, impact and future."

"Study of the in situ stress field in a deep valley and its influence on rock slope stability in Southwest China In Situ Stress; Rock; Stress Distribution The in situ stress field in valley areas is an important factor to consider in the construction of hydropower projects in southwest China. Due to intense tectonic movement, the action of gravity, and rapid river erosion, the resulting stress has a complex distribution and a large magnitude. The availability of stress measurements is insufficient to provide adequate understanding of the regional stress state. In this research, inversion analysis for the in situ stress field of a valley in the upper reaches of the Lancang River is carried out by using stepwise regression analysis and the FLAC3D numerical simulation, and the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the in situ stress are obtained. Based on those results, the influence of stress unloading effects on slope stability is discussed. The results show that the formation of the modern in situ stress field is the comprehensive result of interactions among gravity, tectonic movement, and river erosion. The reliability of the inverse result can be increased by improving the mesh density of the calculated model and considering multistep river erosion. Under the influence of the unloading effects, tensile fractures were formed and the rock mass loosened near the slope surface. With the presence of bedding dipping into the slope, toppling failure was triggered by the unloading rebound that mainly occurred in the stress relaxation zone."

"How are gender inequality and violence against women related? Findings from a population-level community attitudes survey Child Care; Time Use; Domestic Division of Labour Low support for gender equality (GE) predicts attitudes supporting violence against women (VAW). However, little is known about the influence of attitudes toward different manifestations of GE. This study extends knowledge by assessing the relative strength of attitudes to GE across seven theoretically derived dimensions, and their association with attitudes toward VAW. 17,542 Australians participated in the 2017 National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women Survey. Population means were calculated for the following scales formed from survey questions: the Community Attitudes Supportive of Violence Against Women Scale (CASVAWS), the Gender Equality Attitudes Scale (GEAS) and measures within the GEAS representing the theoretical dimensions. There was variation in support for GE between the measures. The lower the support for GE, the higher the support for VAW. Although all GEAS measures included in regression modelling contributed to variance in the CASVAWS, two accounted for more than half. The study suggests benefits in using a multidimensional model of GE to mitigate cultural support for VAW, with emphasis on the private sphere and countering hostility toward women and rigid gender roles and identities."
"CSR and Feminist Organization Studies: Towards an Integrated Theorization for the Analysis of Gender Issues Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy Although corporate social responsibility (CSR) practice increasingly addresses gender issues, and gender and CSR scholarship is expanding, feminist theory is rarely explicitly referenced or discussed in the CSR literature. We contend that this omission is a key limitation of the field. We argue that CSR theorization and research on gender can be improved through more explicit and systematic reference to feminist theories, and particularly those from feminist organization studies (FOS). Addressing this gap, we review developments in feminist organization theory, mapping their relevance to CSR. With reference to six major theoretical perspectives in CSR scholarship, we note feminist research relating to each. Drawing upon FOS theory and CSR theory, we then develop an integrated theoretical framework for the analysis of gender issues in CSR. Our framework enables us to identify research strengths in the gender and CSR literature, as well as gaps therein, to open new conversations and to posit future research directions for this emerging area of scholarship. Our paper illustrates how a better grounding of CSR in feminist theory can contribute to CSR research more broadly."
"Active use and perceptions of parks as urban assets for physical activity: A mixed-methods study Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Parks are potential key urban assets for improved population health; however, their use is not equal among all social groups. Individual and contextual factors could influence residents' perceptions of parks and how they interact with and, eventually, benefit from them. The use of complementary methodologies provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between park use, physical activity (PA), and residents' perceptions. Thus, we designed a mixed-methods study to analyze differences in park use and PA, and the perceptions of parks as urban assets for PA. We selected six parks from three neighborhoods in Madrid (Spain) with different neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES) for systematic social observation. We registered park users by age, PA level (low, medium, and high), gender, and NSES using the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC) audit tool adapted for iOS software (iSOPARC). We also conducted 37 semi-structured interviews and 29 focus groups to analyze residentsâ€™ perceptions of parks as urban assets for PA in the same neighborhoods. We adopted a convergent-parallel design to analyze both quantitative and qualitative data, and to describe the convergence and divergence areas between them. Parks within the high-NSES were more visited, showing a higher proportion of people performing high PA (11.9%) as compared to residents of the middle (9.3%) and low-NSES (3.2%). Female visitors showed lower PA levels compared to men, especially for parks within high-NSES. The following issues were reported as influence urban park use and perceptions: park maintenance and area perception, works constraints, insecurity and crime, differential perceptions by age, and the availability of organized activities in the parks. Residents from high-NSES reported fewer barriers to park use compared to residents from the other areas, who reported limitations such as less leisure time due to job constrains or perceived insecurity in parks. Senior participants reported that having parks with organized activities and a design oriented towards different age-groups are valuable. Our study shows consistency between the fewer and less intense use of parks registered in the middle and low-NSES neighborhoods, and the more barriers for PA reported in this areas during the qualitative analysis. Mixed-methods provided an insight of the potential causes leading to the differences in park use and PA within cities, which is essential in terms of environmental justice and health equity. Thus, a mixed-methods comprehensive approach to public health problems can help designing public policies addressing relevant factors related to urban health inequities."

"An integrated approach of BIM-enabled LCA and energy simulation: The optimized solution towards sustainable development Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Passive design strategies such as orientation, shading, sealing, glazing, and insulation can significantly reduce the necessity of an artificial heating-cooling system, accounting for 40% of total energy usage in the residential building. However, none of the previous studies have quantified the energy reduction and their environmental impacts simultaneously for these passive design parameters to achieve the national standard requirements for house rating. Hence, this study focuses on the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM-Autodesk Revit), energy rating tool (FirstRate5), and BIM-enabled life cycle assessment (LCA-Tally) to quantify, compare, and improve the building design options to reduce carbon footprint and energy consumptions in residential dwellings. Sensitivity analysis has been performed with the @Risk Palisade decision tool for optimizing operational energy efficiency. The sensitivity indices show the ceiling (0.84â€“0.96) and the wall (0.22â€“0.37) are the most influential predictors for passive design strategies to reduce energy consumption. A moderate correlation exists with windows, floors, and orientations (0.13â€“0.29), where the relationship with eave projection, air infiltrations is relatively weak. BIM has been used as a platform of interconnectivity between optimized operational energy of @Risk optimizer and consequent embodied phases. A comparative study of insulation performance identifies that 95% of the ceiling's total operational energy consumption can be minimized using R3 rather than R6 of the national thermal code. For the wall, 90% of energy minimization can occur using R2 rather than R4 of the national thermal code. The study reveals that while insulation is only 1% of the total building mass, and the corresponding carbon footprint and primary energy demand are 4% and 7%, respectively, LCA explains a significant amount of energy, about 76% reduction at its operational stage. In this paper, an evidence-based analytical framework provides a BIM-based optimization platform to validate and justify the impact categories of environment-friendly, energy-efficient design of houses."

"The Role of Cultural Heritage in Promoting Urban Sustainability: A Brief Review Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems Cities are hubs of social and cultural activity, and culture is key to what makes cities creative, and sustainable. The Post-2015 Development Agenda has prioritized culture and how it may help people and communities create the future they desire. The study aims to determine the link between cultural heritage and urban sustainability and how multidisciplinary education can help organize urban issues. The article is of relevance to the emerging multicultural urban society with wide socio-economic disparities straining the global urban resilience and posing a challenge for future policy implementation. A systematic literature review was conducted using the Dimension database, and the results were analyzed using VOS viewer. The study also employed the PRISMA quantitative approach for selection criteria. This paper has identified understudied themes including community heritage, sustainable urban governance, and behavioral and multidisciplinary approaches. It is strongly felt that undertaking this study will not only add to the literature in cultural heritage study but also help further multidisciplinary and knowledge-based inquiry, which is currently evolving in the academic domain. Therefore, urban academics have a duty to resolve the issue confronting global urban sustainability and cultural disputes. Future research is required to simplify the current complex issue to make it more relevant and inclusive."

Characteristics of resilient teaching, both in general and with reference to GISc, are listed and shown to be essentially what might in the past have been called good teaching. Similarly, barriers to resilient teaching are explored and strategies for overcoming them listed. Perhaps the most important conclusion is a widespread desire not to â€œbounce backâ€ to pre-COVID ways, but to use the opportunity to â€œbounce forwardâ€ towards better teaching and learning practices."

Both passive optical remote sensing and active microwave remote sensing can play an important role in the monitoring of forest biomass. In this study, the recently launched Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument satellite and Sentinel-1 SAR satellite systems were evaluated and integrated to investigate the relative strengths of each sensor for mapping aboveground forest biomass at a regional scale. The Australian state of Victoria, with its wide range of forest vegetation was chosen as the study area to demonstrate the scalability and transferability of the approach. In this study aboveground forest biomass (AGB) was defined as the tons of carbon per hectare for the aboveground components (stem, branches, leaves) of all live large trees greater than 10 cm in diameter at breast height (DBHOB). Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data were fused within a machine learning framework using a boosted regression tree model and high-quality ground survey data. Multi-criteria evaluations showed the use of the two independent and fundamentally different Sentinel satellite systems were able to provide robust estimates (R 2 of 0.62, RMSE of 32.2 t.C.ha -1 ) of aboveground forest biomass, with each sensor compensating for the weakness (cloud perturbations and spectral saturation for Sentinel 2, and sensitivity to ground moisture for Sentinel 1) of each other. As archives for Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 continue to grow, mapping aboveground forest biomass and dynamics at moderate resolution over large regions should become increasingly feasible."

"Static pull-in instability and free vibration of functionally graded graphene nanoplatelet reinforced micro-sandwich beams under thermo-electrical actuation Couple Stress; Gradient Elasticity; Microbeams This paper investigates the static pull-in instability and free vibration of a multilayer functionally graded graphene nanoplatelet (GPL) reinforced composite (FG-GPLRC) micro-beam sandwiched between two copper layers subjected to a combined action of an electric voltage and a uniform temperature change based on Eulerâ€“Bernoulli beam theory. The GPL nanofillers are uniformly dispersed within each individual layer while its weight fraction changes from layer to layer in the multilayer FG-GPLRC micro-beam. The modified Halpinâ€“Tsai model is used to predict the effective Youngâ€™s modulus while the rule of mixture is used to determine the effective Poissonâ€™s ratio, mass density and thermal expansion coefficient. The static pull-in voltage and natural frequency of clampedâ€“clamped micro-beams are obtained by employing Galerkin and iterative method. The effects of GPL distribution pattern, weight fraction, geometry and size as well as the geometry of the beam, the temperature change and the total number of layers on the static and dynamic characteristics of the micro-beams are discussed in detail."

"Structural and dynamical effects of targeted mutations on μO-Conotoxin MfVIA: Molecular simulation studies Conotoxins; Conus; Polypeptide Conotoxins are a group of cysteine-rich, neurotoxic peptides isolated from the venom of marine cone snails. MfVIA is a member of the Î¼O-conotoxin family, and acts as an inhibitor of subtype 1.8 voltage-gated sodium ion channels (NaV1.8). The unique selectivity of MfVIA as an inhibitor of NaV1.8 makes it an ideal peptide for elucidation of the physiological functions of this voltage-gated ion channel. Previous experimental studies of point mutations of MfVIA showed that the double mutant [E5K,E8K] exhibited greater activity at NaV1.8 relative to the wild-type toxin. The present study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the effects of various mutations at these key residues (E5 and E8) on the structure and dynamics of MfVIA. Five double mutants were studied, in which the positions 5 and 8 residues were mutated to amino acids with a range of different physicochemical properties, namely [E5A,E8A], [E5D,E8D], [E5F,E8F], [E5K,E8K], and [E5R,E8R]. Except for [E5D,E8D], all of the mutants tend to show decreased contacts at the N-terminus owing to the loss of the R1-E5 salt bridge relative to that of the wild-type, which subsequently lead to greater exposure and flexibility of the N-terminus for most of the mutant peptides studied, potentially rendering them more able to interact with other species, including NaV1.8. Molecular docking studies of the peptides to NaV1.8 via different binding mechanisms suggest that the [E5R, E8R] mutant may be especially worthy of further investigation owing to its predicted binding mode, which differs markedly from those of the other peptides in this study."
"A Hitchhiker's Guide to Particle Sizing Techniques Photon Correlation Spectroscopy; Particle Size Distribution; Nanocrystal Accurate characterization of particle size and particle size distributions is mandatory in nanotechnology and a broad range of colloidal sciences. The size of colloidal particles can be determined using various techniques in direct and reciprocal space, including electron microscopy and static and dynamic light scattering. Differential dynamic microscopy was introduced recently and offers a new alternative. In this paper we present a systematic study of particle size determination using various techniques. We compare the results and highlight advantages and disadvantages. Unexpectedly we find that differential dynamic microscopy offers the unique possibility to determine the particle size in highly turbid samples."

"A focused review on membrane contactors for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) effluents Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling The need for a more sustainable wastewater treatment is more relevant now due to climate change. Production and reuse of methane from anaerobic treatment is one pathway. However, this is defeated by the presence of dissolved methane in the effluent and would be released to the environment, adding to the greenhouse gas emissions. This review paper provided summary and analysis of studies involved in the production of dissolved methane from AnMBR, focusing with actual methane measurement (gas and dissolved) from AnMBR with different types of wastewater. Then more focused discussion and analysis on the use of membrane-based technology or membrane contactors in the recovery of dissolved methane from AnMBR effluent are included, with its development and energy analysis. The dissolved methane removal and recovery rate of membrane contactors can be as high as 96% and 0.05 mol methane/m2/h, respectively, with very low additional energy requirement of 0.01 kWh/m3 for the recovery. Future perspectives presented focus on the long-term evaluation and modelling of membrane contactors and on the membrane modifications to improve the selectivity of membranes to methane and to limit their fouling and wetting, thus making the technology more economical for resource recovery."

"Sustainability practices disclosure of top logistics firms in Australia Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices Purpose: This study explores the scope, materiality and extent of environmental and social sustainability disclosure â€“ as benchmarked against the Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI-G4) â€“ of the top 10 logistics firms operating in Australia. It also investigates the relationships between the extent of environmental and social sustainability disclosure of these firms and their actual financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted an inductive case study approach for an in-depth investigation of the relationships among concepts. A content analysis of the firms' sustainability reports was performed to determine their pattern and extent of sustainability disclosure against the GRI framework. A disclosureâ€“performance analysis (DPA) matrix was employed to relate the extent of environmental and social sustainability disclosure of these 10 firms with their actual financial performance (i.e. return on assets [ROA] and total revenue growth). Findings: This study found that the extent of sustainability reporting was relatively high on the labour practices and decent work subgroup, followed by the environmental dimension of the GRI-G4 framework. However, it was relatively low on the society, human rights and product responsibility subgroups of the GRI framework. The DPA revealed that â€œLeadersâ€ (firms with higher sustainability disclosure levels) achieved significantly higher ROA. However, â€œOpportunistsâ€ (firms with lower sustainability disclosure levels) achieved higher levels of financial returns (i.e. ROA and total revenue growth) with less attention to sustainability issues, which contradicts the win-win view of the sustainability disclosureâ€“financial performance relationship. Originality/value: First, this study contributes an in-depth review of sustainability disclosure practices of top logistics firms operating in Australia. Second, using DPA, it identifies the novel effects of environmental and social sustainability disclosure levels on these firms' financial performance. It also sheds further light on the potential effect of investments beyond substantial profitability for sustainability growth and corporate governance on the sustainability disclosureâ€“financial performance relationship."

"Examining corporate social responsibility awareness: An unaided recall measure Football; Ambush Marketing; Sponsor As professional sports teams commonly partner with multiple charity organizations to achieve corporate social responsibility objectives, the purpose of this research was to measure charity brand awareness among sports fans via unaided recall. Further, this study proposed antecedents to awareness, including; level of fandom, overall season-ticket holder (STH) satisfaction, perceptions of on-field performance, live game viewership frequency, televised game viewership frequency, and digital channel interaction frequency. A survey was used to collect data from STHs across three professional sports teams (n = 8,414). Fan recall of charity partners was low with 1.3% recalling three, 3.5% recalling two, and 9.6% able to recall at least one charity partner. Of the antecedents, overall STH satisfaction and frequency of live game viewership were the most influential while, perceptions of on-field performance returned a significant and negative result. It is advocated sports teams reduce the number of charity partners and charity managers focus communication efforts on more contented STHs who attend live games regularly."

"Designing and delivering skills transferability and employment mobility: the challenges of a market-driven vocational education and training system Apprenticeship Training; Firm; Human Capital Theory As job security declines and precarious employment arrangements become more prevalent, transferable skills have become vital for job seeking success. In recognition of this issue, many governments are seeking to redesign their training systems in ways that transferable skills become better emphasised. This paper examines the challenges of developing transferable skills among a nationâ€™s workforce and the tensions that can emerge between training design intentions and training delivery outcomes when training delivery is marketised. Australia, where incremental training sector reforms have occurred since the late 1980s, serves as the context for this study. While training design occurs through a tripartite process involving employer, government and union representatives, training delivery is now determined in an open, deregulated market environment. Our analysis reveals a complex underlying design with an in-built intention of developing widely transferable skills, yet there exists significant concern about the actual training outcomes. We conclude that in an environment where VET delivery is user-choice driven with the aim of fulfilling specific employer skills needs the quality, depth and breadth of transferable skills are compromised."
"Intellectual property and access to medicines in Africa: A regional framework for access Intellectual Property Rights; Patents; TRIPS Agreement A major target of Goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 is the elimination of 'the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases' and combating 'hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases'. Intellectual property (IP) has been identified as one of the factors impeding access to affordable medicines in developing countries, especially in relation to the HIV pandemic. This book examines the scope of the existing flexibilities in international IP law for promoting access to medicines. It analyses the factors accounting for the underutilisation of the flexibilities in Africa and the measures that African countries may adopt to address the IP barriers to access to medicines. It explores the regional strategies that Africa can adopt to resolve the tension between IP regimes and access to medicines. It also highlights how trade liberalisation and regional integration can play crucial roles in enhancing the use of TRIPS flexibilities, local pharmaceutical manufacturing and access to medicines in Africa. By adopting qualitative research methods to investigate how African countries may effectively use IP to serve public health purposes through the stratagem of regional integration, this book will be a valuable contribution to the existing literature on IP."

"Smart home technologies in everyday life: do they address key energy challenges in households? Household Energy; Energy; Smart Meters Smart home technologies (SHTs) enable new ways of using and managing energy in the domestic sphere. This paper interrogates their contribution to the ambitious carbon emissions reduction efforts required under the 1.5Â°C mitigation pathway set by the Paris Agreement and their suitability for energy poverty alleviation goals. In contrast to aspirational claims for a â€˜smart utopiaâ€™ of greener, less energy intensive, and more comfortable homes currently present in market and policy discourses, we argue that SHTs may reinforce unsustainable energy consumption patterns in the residential sector, are not easily accessible by vulnerable consumers, and do little to help the â€˜energy poorâ€™ secure adequate and affordable access to energy at home."

"3D printed dual macro-, microscale porous network as a tissue engineering scaffold with drug delivering function Tissue Engineering; Scaffold; Selective Laser Sintering Tissue engineering macroporous scaffolds are important for regeneration of large volume defects resulting from diseases such as breast or bone cancers. Another important part of the treatment of these conditions is adjuvant drug therapy to prevent disease recurrence or surgical site infection. In this study, we developed a new type of macroporous scaffolds that have drug loading and release functionality to use in these scenarios. 3D printing allows for building macroporous scaffolds with deterministically designed complex architectures for tissue engineering yet they often have low surface areas thus limiting their drug loading capability. In this proof-of-concept study, we aimed to introduce microscale porosity into macroporous scaffolds to allow for efficient yet simple soak-loading of various clinical drugs and control their release. Manufacturing of scaffolds having both macroporosity and microscale porosity remains a difficult task. Here, we combined porogen leaching and 3D printing to achieve this goal. Porogen microparticles were mixed with medical grade polycaprolactone and extruded into scaffolds having macropores of 0.7 mm in size. After leaching, intra-strut microscale pores were realized with pore size of 20-70 Î¼m and a total microscale porosity of nearly 40%. Doxorubicin (DOX), paclitaxel (PTX) and cefazolin (CEF) were chosen as model drugs of different charges and solubilities to soak-load the scaffolds and achieved loading efficiency of over 80%. The microscale porosity was found to significantly reduce the burst release allowing the microporous scaffolds to release drugs up to 200, 500 and 150 h for DOX, PTX and CEF, respectively. Finally, cell assays were used and confirmed the bioactivities and dose response of the drug-loaded scaffolds. Together, the findings from this proof-of-concept study demonstrate a new type of scaffolds with dual micro-, macro-porosity for tissue engineering applications with intrinsic capability for efficient loading and sustained release of drugs to prevent post-surgery complications."
"Amorphous MoSx-Coated TiO2 Nanotube Arrays for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Catalyst; Cobalt Phosphide; Water Splitting Two-dimensional amorphous MoSx (a-MoSx) has been confirmed to be a highly active and economic electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The development of its hybrid cocatalyst is envisioned to bestow more active sites with appropriate crystal engineering and modified electronic properties for enhancing catalytic performance. In this work, a composite cocatalyst comprising a-MoSx (x = 1.78) and well-ordered anodized TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) is successfully developed through a facile electrodeposition route. The synergistic coupling of the unique vector charge transfer effect of TNAs and proliferation of active sites in a-MoSx derived from the space confinement effect and curved interface growth of TNAs lead to a significant enhancement of HER activity, compared to those of other forms of MoS2-based electrodes that have been previously reported. The MoSx/TNAs electrode exhibits the relatively small onset overpotential of 88 mV and presents an overpotential of 157 mV at 10 mA cm-2 HER current density. The composite electrodes also show an excellent stability with no performance degradation after undergoing 1000 times successive linear sweep voltammetry. The deposition of a-MoSx onto the curved sidewall in a confined space of TNAs is demonstrated to be an effective method to induce the growth of a-MoSx, leading to an enhanced catalytic activity toward HER."

"Corporate political donations, board gender diversity, and corporate social responsibility: Evidence from Australia Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence We examine the association between corporate political donations (CPDs) and the quality of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) listed firms. We also explore the effect of board membersâ€™ gender diversity on this association. Consistent with legitimacy and neopluralist argument, we report a negative association between corporate political donations and the quality of CSR disclosures. Furthermore, board gender diversity acts as the moderator and mitigates the negative association between political donations and CSR disclosures. We also find that it requires more than one female director to moderate the association between CPDs and CSR disclosures which provides support to the critical mass theory. Our additional analysis reveals that the negative association between CPDs and the quality of CSR disclosures is stronger for the resource industry, and the proportion of female directors has an insignificant effect on this association."

"Adaptive governance in carbon farming policies Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework This book discusses a variety of different perspectives involved in biodiversity management and bio-sequestration projects in Australia, working towards achieving adaptive governance in carbon farming. It not only examines landholders' motivation but also the challenges of integrating biodiverse forests into the agricultural landscape. Drawing on the contrast between science and policy stakeholders' views on carbon farming and the practical challenges of achieving adaptive governance, the book discusses the significant gap between theory and practice encountered in this field of study. The book suggests ways of improving the decision-making capacity of government officials and policymakers involved in managing carbon and biodiversity markets, as well as introducing measures to promote adaptive governance by engaging landholders in more effective land conservation. Climate change is a pressing issue on the global political agenda, and this book makes an important contribution to the ongoing debate. This book will be an invaluable reference for practitioners, policymakers and researchers interested in alternative forms of governance in natural resource management."
"COVID-19-Related Racial Discrimination on Asian Australians: An Evaluation of Symptoms of Psychological Distress, Social Support, and Acculturation Perceived Discrimination; African American; Racism COVID-19 restrictions and the social and financial repercussions are negatively affecting the mental health of Australians. Asian Australians may be further at risk of negative mental health outcomes due to the racial discrimination that has emerged during this pandemic. This study used an online questionnaire to assess whether COVID-19-related racial discrimination (firsthand and secondhand), acculturation, and perceived social support predicted psychological distress (depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms) among Asian Australians (n = 113, Mage = 29.82, SDage = 11.96, nonbinary n = 1, female n = 69, male n = 43). Participants perceived high social support and reported moderate amounts of COVID-19-related racial discrimination, as well as moderate cultural preferences for both host and heritage cultures. Multiple regression analyses indicated that (a) social support from significant others and family significantly predicted variance in depressive symptoms, (b) no independent variable was able to significantly predict variance in anxiety, and (c) social support from the family significantly predicted variance in stress. Participants reported mild amounts of depressive symptoms, normal amounts of stress symptoms, and verging amounts of anxiety symptoms that could be considered mild. This research contributes to the wider literature as one of the first studies to focus on Asian Australian mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and to empirically support anecdotal evidence of COVID-19-related racial discrimination."

"Enhancing greywater treatment via MHz-Order surface acoustic waves Surface Acoustic Wave; Droplet; Interdigital Transducers There is a pressing need for efficient biological treatment systems for the removal of organic compounds in greywater given the rapid increase in household wastewater produced as a consequence of rapid urbanisation. Moreover, proper treatment of greywater allows its reuse that can significantly reduce the demand for freshwater supplies. Herein, we demonstrate the possibility of enhancing the removal efficiency of solid contaminants from greywater using MHz-order surface acoustic waves (SAWs). A key distinction of the use of these high frequency surface acoustic waves, compared to previous work on its lower frequency (kHz order) bulk ultrasound counterpart for wastewater treatment, is the absence of cavitation, which can inflict considerable damage on bacteria, thus limiting the intensity and duration, and hence the efficiency enhancement, associated with the acoustic exposure. In particular, we show that up to fivefold improvement in the removal efficiency can be obtained, primarily due to the ability of the acoustic pressure field in homogenizing and reducing the size of bacterial clusters in the sample, therefore providing a larger surface area that promotes greater bacteria digestion. Alternatively, the SAW exposure allows the reduction in the treatment duration to achieve a given level of removal efficiency, thus facilitating higher treatment rates and hence processing throughput. Given the low-cost of the miniature chipscale platform, these promising results highlight its possibility for portable greywater treatment for domestic use or for large-scale industrial wastewater processing through massive parallelization."

"Computer-modelled materials design for metal organic frameworks - ID1 (Masters Candidate: Ibrahim Orhan) Can we teach chemical intuition to an AI in order to develop novel composite porous materials such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs) for direct CO2 capture from air faster than a human could conduct the same work? As we know material and material composite discovery and formulation is a time consuming process. If human input can be minimised in the design of an experiment and analysis of its subsequent results, it is likely that optimised research outcomes can be reached faster and more efficiently. AI has traditionally been
used for single compound discoveries. What is absent is how porous materials and composites can be formed from the existing pool of knowledge and how we can teach it chemical intuition for developing new porous MOFs and composite material systems.
The Student will assist CSIRO with using AI and computerized mathematical simulations and theory such as Monte Carlo simulations to predict, model and develop new MOF and MOF-polymer composite materials for CO2 capture from air . With the aid of AI and simulations, this Project will attempt to use Machine Learning (ML) in workflows to produce MOF materials and MOF-polymer composites that are specifically tailored for engagement for a range of applications and the student will be involved in projects with real-world outcomes. This will include modelling systems and developing the AI to predict MOFs for capturing CO2 at various partial pressures and concentrations.

"Measuring systemic risk and contagion in the European financial network Systemic Risk; Banking; Interbank Markets This paper introduces a novel framework to study default dependence and systemic risk in a financial network that evolves over time. We analyse several indicators of risk, and develop a new latent space model to assess the health of key European banks before, during and after the recent financial crises. We propose a new statistical model that permits a latent space visualisation of the financial system. This provides a clear and interpretable model-based summary of the interaction data, and it gives a new perspective on the topology structure of the network. Crucially, the methodology provides a new approach to assess and understand the systemic risk associated with a financial system, and to study how debt may spread between institutions. Our dynamic framework provides an interpretable map that illustrates the default dependencies between institutions, highlighting the possible patterns of contagion and the institutions that may pose systemic threats."

"DIY Entrepreneurship? – Self-reliance for Women Refugees in Australia Migrant Workers; Self-Employment; Ethnic Business In this paper, we call for a re-examination of the self-reliance ideology based on a neoliberal perspective to make policies for refugee women's (self-)employment and integration. We use a social constructionist perspective to conduct a narrative analysis of data from the lived experience of twelve women refugee entrepreneurs. Three prominent themes emerge from the womenâ€™s own narratives of their entrepreneurial journey â€“ self-reconstruction, social capital, and resilience. Our findings reveal the complexities of self-reconstruction and socialization as experienced by refugee women entrepreneurs â€“ for whom â€œpushâ€ factors take precedence over â€œpullâ€ factors with the explicit understanding that the onus is on them to survive with their own resilience. We argue that offering people hope of a new life means offering them meaningful choices, built on forms of economic activity whose sustainability over the long term is evidenced by the positive supports available to make sure economic activity succeeds."

"A supercapacitor-based inertial response scheme to enhance frequency stability in future energy systems with large wind parks Inertia; Asynchronous Generators; Wind Farms Reduced inertia negatively impacts the frequency stability of power systems resulting in worse frequency nadirs, larger rates of change of frequency, and more dynamic frequency behavior. The issue will become increasingly prevalent in future power systems containing large amounts of inverter-based resources. This paper presents a supercapacitor-based inertial response scheme for wind parks, which provides sufficient complementary active power injection (virtual inertia) for both the regulation and preservation of power system frequency stability. The performance of the wind turbine-supercapacitor combination is verified using a reduced-order, renewable-integrated east Australian test system. Supercapacitors are shown to be a feasible energy storage solution for power systems owing to their swift dynamic response during frequency excursions. Furthermore, the constant power characteristic of the wind park is demonstrated to aid frequency stability under some circumstances."
"Mental Ill Health in Homeless Women: A Review Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease Research indicates that homeless women are reported to experience more mental health issues than women who are not homeless and are an increasing proportion of the overall homeless population. In addition, homeless women are more likely to have alcohol and/or other drug use disorders. We provide a comprehensive review of the contemporary literature that revealed homeless women experience a range of mental health problems including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol and other drug use disorders. Studies in this literature review indicate that some women have pre-existing mental health issues which precipitate homelessness while others develop mental illness because of their homelessness; domestic violence was also recognised as an antecedent to homelessness, although further research is needed in this area. The results of this study indicate that the homeless cohort is a complex one with distinct needs. We provide information that can help refine assessment processes and plan appropriate services to address the mental health needs of homeless women. Finally, recommendations for mental health nursing practice in regard to caring for homeless women are made."

"Effect of laser additive manufacturing on microstructure evolution of inoculated Zr47.5Cu45.5Al5CO2 bulk metallic glass matrix composites Metallic Glasses; Shear Bands; Amorphous Alloys Bulk metallic glass matrix composites are advocated to be material of future owing to their superior strength, hardness and elastic strain limit. However, they possess poor toughness which makes them unusable in any structural engineering application. Inoculation has been used as an effective means to overcome this problem. Zr47.5Cu45.5Al5Co2 bulk metallic glass matrix composites (BMGMC) inoculated with ZrC have shown considerable refinement in microstructure owing to heterogeneous nucleation. Efforts have also been made to exploit modern laser-based metal additive manufacturing to fabricate BMGMC parts in one step. However, the effect of laser treatment on inoculated material is unknown. In this study, an effort has been made to apply laser based additive manufacturing on untreated and inoculated BMGMC samples. It is observed that laser treatment not only refined the microstructure but resulted in change of size, morphology and dispersion of CuZr B2 phase in base metal, heat affected zone and fusion zone. This effect is documented with back scattered electron imaging. This provides a basis for further research to quantify this phenomenon and full-scale part development."
"Mobile money and women’s decision-making power in India Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion In this chapter, the authors use data from the Financial Inclusion Insights (FII) program to examine the association between mobile money and female decision-making power in India. Drawing on different proxies for female decision-making power, the authors show that awareness of, and the use of, mobile money is not sufficient to change behaviours and cultural norms.

"Environmental impacts of COVID-19 on Victoria, Australia, witnessed two waves of Coronavirus Environmental Pollution; Medical Waste; COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic not only has created a global health crisis but also has dramatic effects on the environment. To fight the spread of Coronavirus, governments imposed social distancing policies, which caused negative and positive impacts on the environment. Victoria, the second-most populated state in Australia, was hit by two waves of COVID-19. During the second wave of the pandemic, Victoria, especially Melbourne, experienced one of the most stringent and longest lockdowns globally. In this study, the changes in mobility trends, traffic, air pollution, noise pollution, and waste generation during the first and second waves of COVID-19 in Victoria are evaluated and compared. It was observed that the pandemic had both positive and negative impacts on the environment. During the second wave of the pandemic in Victoria, the mobility trends of public transport hubs, retail and recreation venues, and workplaces experienced a significant drop in movements at respective values of 85%, 83%, and 76% compared to the period of 5 weeks from 3 January to 6 February 2020. PM2.5 levels were lower by 23% at Alphington and 24% at Footscray from 16 March to 1 May 2020 compared with the average PM2.5 levels in the past 4 years. It was estimated that the respective daily generations of used face masks during the first wave and second wave of the pandemic in Victoria were approximately 104 and 160 tons."

"Glycoinformatics of “worm” infection in Southern Bluefin Tuna ""Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) represent Australia’s 2nd largest aquaculture industry and a premium product for export to Asian markets (e.g. Japan and China). Our team (Bott and Nowak) are world-leading experts in two species of flukes (“tuna worms”) that infect ranched SBT. Only a single therapeutic agent is available for treating worm infections in fish as in humans and so there is a need to better understand infection and immunity to develop new anti-infectives and vaccines. Infection, immunity and immune modulation almost certainly relies on the unique glycosylation and glycan-binding proteins found on the surface of the adult worms. We will define the glycoproteome, genome/transcriptome and develop new computational approaches to assess these complex datasets for unique glycan structures, glycan binding proteins and carbohydrate-active enzymes that associate with infection and immunity. This is a grand challenge employing """"big data"""" experimental techniques and is driven by the need for improved computational approaches for dealing with complex, noisy and non-linear datasets and associations. The ultimate outcome will lead to the development of new computationally-driven approaches to identifying new targets for therapeutic development and have a direct impact on industry. The activities involve several locations (virtual and actual interactions):

1) Researchers across RMIT’s Bundoora-City Campuses (Biosciences & Food Technology and Computer Science, SSci)
2) Glycomics Institute at Griffith University, which is the premier glycosciences institute in Australia and one of only a few internationally
3) RMIT Europe through new collaborations with key genomics, bioinformatics and computational resources in Barcelona (CNAG-CRG and BSC)

This project aims to produce new insights about gender and race on the colonial frontier in Australia through revealing Aboriginal women's agency beyond the usual themes of labour and sexual exploitation. The historical record has too often represented Aboriginal women as victims, which has affected self-esteem and caused poor health and social alienation. This project will research how Aboriginal women resisted and negotiated with colonisation by examining the everyday and public performances of Quandamooka women on their own lands, Moreton Bay, Queensland, in the nineteenth century. The project aims to benefit the health and well-being of Aboriginal women."
"What can surveillance data and risk factor research contribute to a public health approach to preventing child sexual abuse? Child Sexual Abuse; Sexual Crime; Female Sex Offender The aim of this article was to consider how population-level surveillance data and risk factor research might be applied to a public health approach to preventing child sexual abuse. The focus is on the collection of data in relation to ethnicity. By drawing from the four principles approach to ethical decision making developed by Beauchamp and Childress, the expected benefits of data collection are weighed against possible harms to individuals and communities. It concludes that the identification of high-risk groups can inform prioritisation of resources, and the development of context-specific and culturally sensitive child sexual abuse prevention and intervention programmes. However, it is crucial to explain why child sexual abuse is more prevalent in some ethnic communities than others. Explanations about causes can reduce the potential for stigmatisation and marginalisation of individuals and communities, as well as challenge widely held myths about biological determinism and inability to change."

"Better transport accessibility, better health: A health economic impact assessment study for Melbourne, Australia Bicycling; Bike; Cyclist Background: Physical inactivity is a global public health problem, partly due to urbanization and increased use of passive modes of transport such as private motor vehicles. Improving accessibility to public transport could be an effective policy for Governments to promote equity and efficiency within transportation systems, increase population levels of physical activity and reduce the negative externalities of motor vehicle use. Quantitative estimates of the health impacts of improvements to public transport accessibility may be useful for resource allocation and priority-setting, however few studies have been published to inform this decision-making. This paper aims to estimate the physical activity, obesity, injury, health and healthcare cost-saving outcomes of scenario-based improvements to public transport accessibility in Melbourne, Australia. Methods: Baseline and two hypothetical future scenario estimates of improved public transport accessibility for Melbourne, Australia, were derived using a spatial planning and decision tool designed to simulate accessibility performance (the Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems (SNAMUTS)). Public transport related physical activity was quantified by strata of age group and sex from Melbourne travel survey data (VISTA survey) and used with the SNAMUTS Composite Index to estimate input data for health impact modelling for the Melbourne population aged 20-74 years. A proportional multi-state, multiple cohort lifetable Markov model quantified the potential health gains and healthcare cost-savings from estimated changes in physical activity, body weight and injuries related to walking to access/egress public transport under two scenarios: (S1) public transport accessibility under current policy directions, and (S2) multi-directional, high-frequency network improvements. Results: Multi-directional, high-frequency improvements to the public transport network (S2) resulted in significantly greater health and economic gains than current policy directions (S1) in relation to physical activity (mean 6.4 more MET minutes/week), body weight (mean 0.05 kg differential), health-adjusted life years gained (absolute difference of 4878 HALYs gained) and healthcare cost-savings (absolute difference of AUD43M), as compared to business as usual under both scenarios (n = 2,832,241 adults, over the lifecourse). Conclusions: Based on our conservative analyses, improving accessibility to public transport will improve population health by facilitating physical activity and lead to healthcare cost savings compared with business-as-usual. These wider health benefits should be better considered in transport planning and policy decisions."

"Analysing the association of dissonance between actual and ideal commute time and commute satisfaction Commute; Bicycling; Travel Many studies have indicated that commute satisfaction is affected by commute time. However, the dissonance between people's actual and ideal commute time and its effects on travel satisfaction have not been adequately explored in previous research. By using survey data from Xi'an, China, this study examines whether respondents travelling with an ideal commute time will have higher levels of travel satisfaction compared to those travelling with non-ideal commute times. Results from this study, analysing self-reported actual and ideal commute trip durations of 833 respondents, suggest that less than 20% of the participants travel with their ideal commute time and that the dissonance between actual and ideal commute time has a significant impact on travel satisfaction. Commute satisfaction is highest for respondents travelling with their ideal commuting time, followed by those whose actual commute time is shorter than ideal. Respondents whose actual commute time is longer than the ideal commute time experience the lowest levels of travel satisfaction. Moreover, commute satisfaction decreases when the inconsistency between actual and ideal commute time increases. These results suggest that the effect of commute duration on travel satisfaction might be overestimated and partly mediated by people's preferred commute time. Finally, we also found that the dissonance between actual and ideal commute time significantly differs according to the chosen travel mode, which might partly explain differences in commute satisfaction according to the chosen mode. After controlling for commute time dissonance, the effects of commute time and travel mode on commute satisfaction are weak."

"The Lurujarri Dreaming Trail In this course you will have the opportunity to learn about, listen to,discuss and engage with indigenous people about their knowledge andrelationship to land. You will spend 9 days with the Goolarbooloo people ofBroome W.A. walking the Lurujarri dreaming trail. Lurujarri, meaning coastaldunes, is the Aboriginal name that generally describes the stretch of countryfrom Broome, W.A. to Minarriny, about 90 kms to the north of Broome. The trailfollows part of a traditional Aboriginal song cycle that originated from theDreamtime. The background and significance of the trail is outlined by FransHoogland as follows:-    We have to learn to see again, learn to walk, to feel all these things again.This is why the Lurujarri trail is so important. The Lurujarri trail will getus to listen, to start walking slowly, and to teach people...people areintroduced to the song cycle through direct experience of walking, of beingwith it, trying to understand the living quality of the country. That have tobe experienced. Its very hard to grasp that out of reading books or throughpeople talking (Sinatra and Murphy Listen to the People : Listen to the Land1999, Melbourne University Press).    The course does not aim to provide you with an overview of Aboriginal cultureand knowledge about land and land management but rather it aims to introduceyou to a different way of knowing 'country' from the perspective of theGoolarbaloo people of Broome. Insights gained will assist you towards anappreciation of different ways of knowing land and an understanding of some ofthe issues involved in working collaboratively with Aboriginal people. AsMarcia Langton observes:-    Aboriginal and western systems of knowledge are parallel, co-existing, butdifferent, ways of knowing. Scientific descriptions of nature and precepts ofthe natural world cannot subsume traditional ways of knowledge. Collaborativeprojects are not merely annexing traditional systems of knowledge, but rather,interacting with them, and thus the outcomes are neither absolutely the resultof scientific thought nor that of Aboriginal thought. Rather each is a sourceof understanding the very difficult issues that are posed by the natural worldon this continent (Marcia Langton Burning Questions ; emerging environmentalissues for indigenous peoples in northern Australia 1998 Centre for IndigenousNatural and Cultural Resource Management, NT)"

"Protected industrial action ballots: An empirical view Personnel; Enterprise Bargaining; Employer Association Workplace relations in Australia, including requirements relating to the use of industrial action in the context of enterprise bargaining, are governed by the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (FW Act). Legally protected industrial action by employees and their bargaining representatives can lawfully be taken only in the context of, and is conditional upon, approval through a secret ballot of the employees to whom the proposed agreement is to apply. Conducting such a ballot is itself conditional upon first obtaining a protected industrial action ballot order from the Fair Work Commission. Whilst there is a relatively large body of published industrial relations research exploring both the frequency and the impact of strike action, there is significantly less published material on the regulation of decisions relating to industrial action by workers and their trade unions. This article provides a preliminary report on a research project which is intended to help fill this gap in the literature. Drawing on data resulting from an analysis of every protected industrial action ballot order application made to the Fair Work Commission during the reference period, the article describes the protected industrial action ballot order process in practice. This in turn facilitates understanding of the regulatory contribution made by the provisions and raises significant questions over whether the administrative burden is justified by the outcomes achieved."

"Pyrolysis for plastic waste management: An engineering perspective Plastic Waste; Pyrolysis; Catalyst The pervasion of plastic and the inadequacies of the current plastic waste management processes are the premise of various studies that aimed to find sustainable solutions to the plastic waste issues. Amongst these solutions, plastic pyrolysis is particularly promising due to its commercial maturity and complementarity to mechanical recycling. In this paper, recent studies of plastic pyrolysis are reviewed and scrutinised, with particular attention given to feedstock composition, operating conditions, and catalytic choices. Our systematic review found that the success of plastic pyrolysis is dependent on many inter-related operational factors, such as temperature, residence time, and feedstock characteristics. Thus, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance our understanding of the various interconnected parameters involved in plastic pyrolysis. However, AI capacity must be further improved to incorporate more variables such as contaminants, fluctuating feedstocks, and mixed polymers. Many Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) studies have provided abundant evidence showing that plastic pyrolysis is more environmentally beneficial incineration and landfill. Hence, future LCA studies should shift from a comparative perspective to a more holistic approach where plastic pyrolysis is considered as an integrated part of a sustainable waste management system. The review has also identified that more research efforts should be directed towards catalytic pyrolysis and monomer recovery."

"Wastewater recycling in Antarctica: Performance assessment of an advanced water treatment plant in removing trace organic chemicals Ethinylestradiol; Endocrine Disruptors; Wastewater Treatment The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) operates Australia's Davis Station in the Antarctic. In 2005, Davis Station's wastewater treatment plant failed and since then untreated, macerated effluent has been discharged to the ocean. The objectives of this study were to determine whether an advanced water treatment plant (AWTP) commissioned by the AAD and featuring a multi-barrier process involving ozonation, ceramic microfiltration, biologically activated carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, ultraviolet disinfection and chlorination was capable of producing potable water and a non-toxic brine concentrate that can be discharged with minimal environmental impact. The AWTP was tested using water from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Tasmania, Australia. We used spot water and passive sampling combined with two multi-residue chromatographic-mass spectrometric methods and a range of recombinant receptor-reporter gene bioassays to screen trace organic chemicals (TrOCs), toxicity and receptor activity in the Feed water, in the environmental discharge (reject water), and product water from the AWTP for six months during 2014â€“15, and then again for three months in 2016. Across the two surveys we unambiguously detected 109 different TrOCs in the feed water, 39 chemicals in the reject water, and 34 chemicals in the product water. Sample toxicity and receptor activity in the feed water samples was almost totally removed in both testing periods, confirming that the vast majority of the receptor active TrOCs were removed by the treatment process. All the NDMA entering the AWTP in the feed and/or produced in the plant (typically < 50 ng/L), was retained into the reject water with no NDMA observed in the product water. In conclusion, the AWTP was working to design, and releases of TrOCs at the concentrations observed in this study would be unlikely cause adverse effects on populations of aquatic organisms in the receiving environment or users of the potable product water."
"Toward sustainable environmental quality: Identifying priority research questions for Latin America PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs The Global Horizon Scanning Project (GHSP) is an innovative initiative that aims to identify important global environmental quality research needs. Here we report 20 key research questions from Latin America (LA). Members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) LA and other scientists from LA were asked to submit research questions that would represent priority needs to address in the region. One hundred questions were received, then partitioned among categories, examined, and some rearranged during a workshop in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Twenty priority research questions were subsequently identified. These research questions included developing, improving, and harmonizing across LA countries methods for 1) identifying contaminants and degradation products in complex matrices (including biota); 2) advancing prediction of contaminant risks and effects in ecosystems, addressing lab-to-field extrapolation challenges, and understanding complexities of multiple stressors (including chemicals and climate change); and 3) improving management and regulatory tools toward achieving sustainable development. Whereas environmental contaminants frequently identified in these key questions were pesticides, pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors or modulators, plastics, and nanomaterials, commonly identified environmental challenges were related to agriculture, urban effluents, solid wastes, pulp and paper mills, and natural extraction activities. Several interesting research topics included assessing and preventing pollution impacts on conservation protected areas, integrating environment and health assessments, and developing strategies for identification, substitution, and design of less hazardous chemicals (e.g., green chemistry). Finally, a recurrent research need included developing an understanding of differential sensitivity of regional species and ecosystems to environmental contaminants and other stressors. Addressing these critical questions will support development of long-term strategic research efforts to advance more sustainable environmental quality and protect public health and the environment in LA.

"The Distribution of Artistic Human Capital – A Typology Building Approach Agglomeration Economies; Creative Class; China Artists have long been understood to play a vital role in local communities. Our intent is to develop a deeper understanding of the distribution of artistic human capital; specifically, the extent to which particular patterns of co-location exist across Australia. We find little evidence of patterns by type of artistic human capital. Interestingly, however, our analysis does reveal a form of grouping that enables us to prescribe a typology based on the degree to which the number of types of artistic human capital resides. Using this typology we explore differences among states and regions across Australia."
"Geometry of wrap profiles in co-rotating scroll compressors Injection; Air Source Heat Pumps; Refrigerants Due to their high level of reliability, low noise, and relatively higher efficiency, scroll compressors have gained extensive popularity among existing gas compression technologies. Unlike the orbital version of this technology that is commercially available, the co-rotating type is yet in the research and development stage. The latter is expected to achieve a lower noise level and higher specific power. To investigate the physics of these devices, a succinct mathematical tool is required to construct and analyse their geometry. In this paper, we introduce such a modelling tool for co-rotating scroll compressors including their dual-arc tip profile modification and excluding any manufacturing inaccuracies and clearance gaps between the two scroll components. Using this model, one can easily reproduce the geometry of compression chambers and simulate their motion and transformation over the course of compression."

"Loading CuFe2O4 onto ceramic fabric for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue under visible light irradiation Ferrous Gluconate; 2-Naphthol Orange; Organic Pollutants Recycling of photocatalyst in wastewater treatment is a big challenge. Fixation of photocatalyst on a flexible surface of solid substrates is a promising solution. In this work, copper ferrite (CuFe2O4) particles were loaded onto polydopamine (pDA) pretreated ceramic/polyester fabrics (CPF) via coprecipitation. The CPF not only acts as loading material for CuFe2O4 particles, but also makes this photocatalyst convenient to recycle. The morphology, elemental composition and structure of the as-fabricated CPF/CuFe2O4 were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The degradation rate of methylene blue (MB) by the CPF/CuFe2O4 photocatalyst reached to 98.2% under visible light irradiation for 80 min, reflecting the excellent photocatalytic activity of the composites. The CPF/CuFe2O4 demonstrated good photostability and recoverability, indicating its great potential in wastewater treatment. Moreover, the degradation mechanism and possible degradation pathway of MB by CPF/CuFe2O4 photocatalyst were investigated."

"Mirror, mirror on the wall: is economics the fairest of them all? An investigation into the social sciences and humanities in Vietnam Co-Authorship; Scientific Collaboration; Bibliometric Analysis Three major scientific policies implemented in 2008, 2014, and 2017 have pushed Vietnam's social sciences and humanities (SSH) toward higher international standards. This study uses descriptive and Bayesian approaches on a dataset of 1,564 Vietnamese authors in the 2008-18 period to understand the changes under the new policies and the remaining challenges. The findings indicate that Economics is the most productive SSH field, with 858 publications in 11 years. Even though the number of authors has risen rapidly, gender disparity is still an issue. Economics has benefitted the most from Vietnam's development, and to a lesser extent, so have Education and Social Medicine. Future policies should aim to provide an enabling environment for female and early career researchers in every SSH field in Vietnam. The study calls for responsible usage of cross-discipline publication data to maintain a transparent source of information."

"The Intergenerational Impacts of War: Bombings and Child Labour in Vietnam Infant Health; War Exposure; Child Health While adverse consequences of war for the generation who lived through the conflict have been well documented in the literature, the intergenerational impacts of war have received far less attention. We provide causal evidence on the impact of bombings during the Vietnam War on the prevalence of child labour among second-generation Vietnamese, defined as those born after the Vietnam War. Our preferred results, which instrument for bombing intensity using distance to the 17th parallel north latitude, suggest that a 10% increase in the intensity of bombings generates a 1.9 percentage point increase in the probability that a child worked in the last 12 months. This result is robust to several checks. We examine several potential channels and find that this relationship is mediated through household poverty."
"Contextual factors of entrepreneurship intention in manufacturing SMEs: the case study of Iran Entrepreneurial Orientation; Corporate Entrepreneurship; Small And Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to establish the contextual factors that influence entrepreneurial intention to start the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Iran and to investigate why some manufacturing sector entrepreneurs achieve growth objectives while others do not. Design/methodology/approach: In-depth semistructured interviews of 25 participants were used to investigate the contextual factors of entrepreneurship intention. On the basis of the data collected, a thematic content analysis has been carried out. Findings: A set of contextual and cultural factors has been highlighted by the analysis. Data analysis led to the extraction of three main themes: external, internal and personal factors that were found to be significant determinants of entrepreneurship intention. In relation to the effect of these factors on their entrepreneurial behaviors, it emerged that there were the major barriers to entrepreneurial intentions including lack of resources, financial challenges and economic situation, which affected how they made strategic decisions about their plans. Moreover, the findings show that the key dimensions of organizational structure, public policies, social media, education and soft skills development are vital features and being influential in entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications: The study has industry-specific, size-specific and region-specific limitations. The qualitative research approach affects the generalizable character of the results. Practical implications: The research findings have important implications for practicing entrepreneurs, start-ups and policymakers. The manuscript suggests a transition to a more collaborative approach from experts and practitioners in the field through policymakers to tackling the underlying determinants of entrepreneurship intention in Iran as a motive to economic growth. This research is significant since its findings should help regulators and investors better understand the opportunities and threats among manufacturing SMEs. This study implies a step forward in research into the entrepreneurship intention and SMEs literature, since the results differ from the evidence found for large companies in developing countries such as Iran. There is also a great contribution toward the debate regarding the need to consider the context and the type of firm in enterprise development studies. Originality/value: This is the first empirical study conducted in Iran that explores three key elements of entrepreneurship intention interactively in Iran through qualitative research analysis. The research study fills a literature gap on the determinants of manufacturing SMEsâ€™ functions. This manuscript explores the contextual factors that influence on entrepreneurial behavior in a conflict country context, using a thematic analysis for in-depth results. A new approach to evaluating entrepreneurial opportunities was used. The advantage of this empirical strategy is that it takes into account in more detail the content observations and experiences with the industry-specific insights. It also gives more description about the contingent nature of practice. Moreover, this qualitative research acknowledged the areas of conflict and contradiction around entrepreneurship phenomena among SMEs."

"Review of drivers and threats to coastal groundwater quality in China Nutrients; Submarines; Radon With rapid socio-economic development, China's coastal areas are among the fastest growing and most economically dynamic regions in the world. Under the influence of climate change and human activities, protecting the quality of coastal groundwater has emerged as one of the key environmental and resource management issues for these areas. This paper reviews (for the first time) groundwater quality data for the coastal basins of China, where over 600 million people live, focussing on key inorganic indicators/pollutants; groundwater salinity, nitrate, fluoride, and arsenic. These pollutants present major water quality issues and are also valuable as indicators of wider processes and influences impacting coastal groundwater quality â€“ e.g. saltwater intrusion, agricultural pollution and release of geo-genic contaminants. We discuss the major drivers causing water quality problems in different regions and assess future trajectories and challenges for controlling changes in coastal groundwater quality in China. Multiple processes, including modern and palaeo seawater/brine migration, groundwater pumping for agricultural irrigation, pollution from agrochemical application, rapid development of aquaculture, urban growth, and water transfer projects, may all be responsible (to different degrees) for changes observed in coastal groundwater quality, and associated long-term health and ecological effects. We discuss implications for sustainable coastal aquifer management in China, arguing that groundwater monitoring and contamination control measures require urgent improvement. The evolution and treatment of coastal groundwater quality problems in China will serve as an important warning and example for other countries facing similar pressures, due to climate change, coastal development, and intensification of anthropogenic activity in coming decades."

Prior discussions with teaching staff from the two universities and engagement with the villagers in Indonesia set up the scope of the teaching and learning experiences for both cohorts of students. Australian students funded through the New Colombo Plan from various disciplinary programs interacted with architecture and design students from an Indonesian university in Indonesia over a two-week period. The students worked collaboratively to undertake a needs analysis and develop designs for a multifunction educational facility for a village in the island of Java, Indonesia. The village community was involved in the participatory process for informing and developing the concept designs, which were then presented to the village community for selection and construction. The students and teachers were strangers to each other before the collaborative classroom experience. Yet, the bonds formed between teachers and students of both cultures went beyond the classroom. The cohorts of Australian students and the Indonesian students continued to engage with each other not just immediately after their experience of working together in the Indonesian classroom, but also beyond their university life. Such experiences during university life not only create a deeper understanding of sustainability from multiple dimensions, but also life-long friendships between students, shaping their post university work and life experiences. Recommendations are provided to support such experiences."
"Building and promoting the Australasian Frugal Innovation Network The number of scholarly publications on Google Scholar containing ?Frugal innovation? increased exponentially starting with a handful of papers in 2009 to over 3,500 by the end of 2018. This work is being done by a growing number of individual scholars and clusters of scholars from all over the world. Some frugal innovation (FI) research centres have been established in Europe and the USA that also engage in consultation work with industry. At RMIT our group of multi-disciplinary FI researchers led by me is in the process of establishing a similar regional entity that will go by the name of the Australasian FI Network. Its aim is to rapidly develop capability in this discipline and expand collaboration activities with more international researchers and research entities ? currently only with the Centre for Frugal Innovation at TUHH (Hamburg). To do so effectively we require the assistance of an assistant to grow our network by building a comprehensive database of FI scholars and centres around the world. This will help us to identify potential partners for collaboration in activities such as joint research papers, cotutelle agreements, forming international teams that submit research proposals for raising external funding (e.g. ARC Linkage, Food Agility CRC or international grant) and doing joint industry consultation. We shall have all of this completed by December 2019 from the Melbourne campus."

"A consumer definition of eco-friendly packaging Community Participation; Green Product; Environmental Attitudes Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental consequences of packaging. Businesses are under pressure not only from consumers but also from governments to use eco-friendly packaging for their products. However, what consumers perceive to be eco-friendly packaging is still unclear, especially in emerging markets. This study examines consumer perceptions of eco-friendly packaging in the context of packaged food products of Vietnam. The study involved a series of six focus group discussions conducted with a diverse range of consumers. The focus of the discussion was consumer perceptions of eco-friendly packaging, particularly whether or not consumers would adjust their purchase behaviours to be more environmentally friendly. The data analysis procedure was undertaken using inductive manual coding principles associated with interpretivist research. The results indicate that consumer perceptions of eco-friendly packaging can be categorised along three key dimensions: packaging materials, manufacturing technology and market appeal. While consumers have diverse perceptions of eco-friendly packaging, their knowledge is limited and more related to packaging materials (such as biodegradability and recyclability), and market appeal (such as attractive graphic design and good price). Consumers show little knowledge about manufacturing technologies but still desire an eco-friendly manufacturing process. Results also suggest that a consumer-defined eco-friendly package for food products should be visually appealing while satisfying consumersâ€™ environmental expectations relating to packaging materials and manufacturing process. We therefore propose a consumer-initiated development of eco-friendly packaging that can be applied for sustainable packaging strategies."

"Challenges and Current Status of the Biological Treatment of PFAS-Contaminated Soils Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are Synthetic Organic Compounds (SOCs) which are of current concern as they are linked to a myriad of adverse health effects in mammals. They can be found in drinking water, rivers, groundwater, wastewater, household dust, and soils. In this review, the current challenge and status of bioremediation of PFAs in soils was examined. While several technologies to remove PFAS from soil have been developed, including adsorption, filtration, thermal treatment, chemical oxidation/reduction and soil washing, these methods are expensive, impractical for in situ treatment, use high pressures and temperatures, with most resulting in toxic waste. Biodegradation has the potential to form the basis of a cost-effective, large scale in situ remediation strategy for PFAS removal from soils. Both fungal and bacterial strains have been isolated that are capable of degrading PFAS; however, to date, information regarding the mechanisms of degradation of PFAS is limited. Through the application of new technologies in microbial ecology, such as stable isotope probing, metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics there is the potential to examine and identify the biodegradation of PFAS, a process which will underpin the development of any robust PFAS bioremediation technology."

"How cholesterol optimises ion pump function in animal membranes (Administered by University of Sydney) The aims of the Project are to determine how cholesterol optimises ion pump function in animal membranes and to identify the major effects of cholesterol and its derivatives on the physical properties of membranes. High levels of cholesterol (up to 50 mol%) are required in the plasma membrane of all animal cells for survival. Insufficient cholesterol biosynthesis leads to severe birth defects. The requirement for cholesterol is likely linked in part to its acceleration of pump activity. The sodium pump is essential to numerous physiological processes (e.g. cell division, nerve, muscle and kidney activity). A benefit of our study will be knowledge on the molecular origin of diseases associated with inhibition of cholesterol production."
"Trends in environmental and toxicity research on organic ultraviolet filters: A scientometric review Sunscreening Agent; Oxybenzone; Octocrylene In recent decades, the potential toxicological and environmental effects of organic ultraviolet filters (OUVF) have received growing attention. The number of studies in this area has increased; however, presently there is no scientometric perspective addressing this topic. The purpose of this study is to identify the intellectual base and research front using the visualization and analysis software, CiteSpace. We retrieved 453 articles, published in print or online as an early-access article between 2002 and 2020, from the Web of Science with a topic search related to OUVFs, environment, and toxicology. We then analysed synthesized networks of co-authorship (author, institution, country), co-citation (author, document, journal) and co-occurring keywords. The annual publication output has trended upwards since 2002. Authors based in China accounted for 29.4% of the total publications, followed by USA (17.4%); but overall publications from Switzerland and Spain were more influential. Major research themes identified included OUVF concentrations in aquatic environments, and hormonal effects. Emerging themes included improving the sensitivity of analytical detection methods for both OUVFs and their metabolites, consequences of OUVF transport to the marine environment, and concerns over prenatal exposure. Based on keyword analysis, benzophenone-3, 4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, 3-benzylidene camphor, and ethylhexyl-methoxycinnamate are the most studied OUVFs, and effects on estrogenic activity, gene expression, reproduction, and more recently, oxidative stress, have received most attention from a toxicological perspective. Other prominent topics were sources of environmental contamination and ecological risk assessments. This study maps the major research domains of OUVF environmental toxicology research; explanations and implications of the findings are discussed; and emerging trends highlighted."

"Organizational politics as a blindfold: Employee work engagement is negatively related to supervisor-rated work outcomes when organizational politics is high Psychological Capital; Work Engagement; Personnel Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the moderating effect of organizational politics on the relationships between work engagement, in-role performance and organization citizenship behavior â€“ organization (OCBO). Design/methodology/approach: Theoretical hypotheses were tested using a sample of 107 supervisor-subordinate dyads in China. Outcome variables, such as in-role performance and OCBO, were rated by supervisors. Findings: Contrary to the established literature on positive work engagement-work outcomes relationships, the findings supported the prediction that work engagement was negatively related to supervisor-rated in-role performance and OCBO when the organizational is perceived as highly political. Research limitations/implications: The sample size for this study is relatively small. In addition, the authors measured organizational politics from employeesâ€™ perspectives, which might not reflect reality objectively. Furthermore, the data were collected at a single time point, so causal relationships could not be validated. Practical implications: When employees perceive the work environment as political, organizations need to be aware of non-work factors that may influence supervisorsâ€™ evaluation of employee performance to ensure they do not demotivate and discourage highly engaged employees. Originality/value: Considerable research has shown that work engagement is positively related to in-role performance and OCBO. The present study, however, challenges and extends previous research by suggesting that work engagement can lead to low supervisor evaluation of in-role performance and OCBO when the organization is perceived to be political."

"Religion and the Risks of Sexually Transmissible Infections: Evidence from Britain Communication; Adolescent Sexual Behavior; Pregnancy in Adolescence Although a growing body of literature has explored the association between religion and the prevalence of sexually transmissible infections (STIs), the focus has mainly been on HIV/AIDS and developing countries. Using data from the British National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal), we examine the direct association between religion and the prevalence of STIs including individual perception of exposure and risk of STIs. We focus on the importance of religion to respondents, religious affiliation as well as frequency of attendance to religious meetings. Our analyses suggest that being religious and frequently attending religious meetings are associated with lower odds of being diagnosed with STIs as well as lower self-assessed risk of getting HIV/AIDS. This seems particularly true for adherents of Christianity and more specifically, those of the Catholic denomination."

"Taking a broader approach to women's retention in construction: Incorporating the university domain Personnel; Career Barriers; Employed Women Arguably, young professional women commence their transition into the construction industry upon commencement of their university studies. It is possible that women may be exposed to gendered barriers to success both directly and indirectly while at university, which may impact on their intentions of pursuing a career in construction. Construction can be considered as an ecosystem consisting of various interrelated components. This paper aims to extend the 'leaky pipeline' narrative by identifying key actors in the university domain who can influence the retention of young professional women in construction. Faculty can support women in construction through learning and teaching and research activities. A critical reflective approach is used to explore the characteristics of the university learning and teaching environment and the peer-review research process. It is recommended that the university be acknowledged as an integral component of the construction ecosystem. Future research should consider how the university influences and shapes decisions around the retention of women in construction. Without substantial and sustained change across the construction ecosystem, women will remain underrepresented in the construction industry and futile calls for increased participation will continue."

"Inquiry into social impact investment for housing and homelessness outcomes Housing Supply; Suburban Area; Brisbane Project context Australia faces numerous and complex housing and homelessness challenges. The waiting lists for social housing are long and a significant proportion of the social housing stock is no longer fit-for-purpose (194,600 households are on social housing waiting lists (AIHW 2017a)), large proportions of the population are in housing stress because of the unaffordability of housing (between 2001 and 2016, median annual rent increased by 130% and median mortgage repayments by 102%, compared to an 82% increase in median household income (Centre for Social Impact, forthcoming)) and too many people are experiencing homelessness (approximately 1 in 200 people are homeless each night (Centre for Social Impact, forthcoming) and homelessness increased by approximately 14% between 2011 and 2016 (ABS, 2018)). New and scalable solutions are needed, but governments are increasingly fiscally constrained. Long-term trends such as an ageing population will likely exacerbate these fiscal challenges in the future (The Treasury 2015). Further, despite significant investment by governments (and philanthropists), some social policy areas' social outcomes are not markedly improving (Reeve, Marjolin et al. 2016). New solutions and scaled existing effective solutions with the right financial resources are required. Social impact investment (SII) may offer part of the solution. SII is investment intending to generate social and financial returns, while actively measuring both (SIIT 2014; GIIN 2016), and it is a growing mechanism for using capital from investors to finance solutions to complex social problems. There is significant interest in using SII to address problems in social and affordable housing and homelessness in Australia. It potentially provides government with additional policy tools and a promising framework to design and fund more effective solutions to complex social problems, including housing and homelessness, and attract other forms of capital to co-invest alongside it. However, further evidence is required on whether, how, and under what conditions, SII might work in addressing housing and homelessness issues, especially in the Australian fiscal and policy context. This Inquiry aimed to begin to further develop this evidence base. The study This is the final report for the AHURI Inquiry into social impact investment for housing and homelessness outcomes. This report provides an analysis of the overall insights from across the Inquiry's three projects.1 These insights were gathered from a critical analysis of 158 publications, a workshop with 32 expert diverse stakeholders, in-depth interviews with 70 key stakeholders, an online survey with 72 people across the financial, housing and SII sectors, and 3 case studies. Guided by the Inquiry's focus and research questions, this report has been written for a reasonably informed audience of current and potential SII actors, but with the aim of making the information accessible to a broader audience than the underlying project reports. Key Inquiry findings â€¢ SII is an investment that targets a social (or environmental) objective. SIIs can be defined as having four components: 1 Intentionality-it intends to achieve social objectives 2 Return expectations-it expects a financial and a social return 3 Measurement-the social impact can be and is measured 4 Additionality-the outcome from the investment is beyond what would have been achieved without the investment. SII is relatively new, not well understood, and there is not a shared understanding of its definition or when and how it occurs and might be applied. This finding underscores the need to develop and use shared and clear explanations for the core definitional elements of SII when developing policy and/or designing and implementing SII solutions to promote the best possible outcomes."

"Energy, exergy, and sustainability analyses of the agricultural sector in Bangladesh Exergy; Rotary Kilns; Energy Efficiency Globally, the agriculture sector consumes a considerable portion of energy. Optimizing energy consumption and energy loss from different fuel-based types of machinery will increase the energy sustainability of this sector. Exergy analysis is a useful optimizing method that applies the thermodynamic approach to minimize energy loss. The main goal of this study is to highlight the impact of exergy loss on the energy sustainability of the agriculture sector. Hence, this study focuses on the implementation of exergy-based sustainability parameters to determine the sustainability of the agricultural sector in Bangladesh. A comprehensive analysis combining energy, exergy, and sustainability indicators was conducted based on the data obtained from 1990 to 2017. Overall energy and exergy efficiencies varied between 29.86% and 36.68% and 28.2% and 35.4%, respectively, whereas the sustainability index varied between 1.39 and 1.54. The values of relative irreversibility and lack of productivity indices from diesel fuel are higher than that of other fuel types. Maximum relative irreversibility is 0.95, whereas maximum lack of productivity is 2.50. The environmental effect factor of diesel fuel is the highest (2.47) among all the analyzed fuel types. Replacing old farming devices and selecting appropriate farming methods, appliances, and control systems will reduce exergy loss in this sector."

"Business breakfast/Business around the Table In order to facilitate industry engagement and effective collaboration of academic staff it is proposed to run two types of events (1) Business breakfast and (2) ?Business Around the Table?. Both approach come from the best business practice. Underpinning philosophy of both is social learning process, which proposes that new behaviors can be acquired by observing and imitating others. It states that learning is a cognitive process that takes place in a social context and can occur purely through observation. This process is especially effective when motivation is enhanced and stimulated through effective social communication. 

The engagement and collaboration with industry and the tertiary sector will be based on a bespoke, tailored business practice. For instance business leaders will be invited from resources companies like RioTinto, BHP Billiton, AMIRA International, Shell Global to discuss various challenges industry face. 

When participants involved in learning about common problems (in this case industry problems), this lead to moral development, involves the ability of individuals to make judgments aside self-interest, the ability to take perspective of others, regardless of how these may affect ones own personal interests or values, learning how to co-operate with others. When applied within a high education context, the process of Social Learning engenders an understanding of civic responsibility to industry and community in society large. Ultimately it will lead to innovation and collaboration culture within the organisation. "

"Influence of bottom ash and polypropylene fibers on the physico-mechanical, durability and thermal performance of foam concrete: An experimental investigation Tobermorite; Foaming Agent; Autoclaved Aerated Concrete Recently, foam concrete (FC) has been widely considered due to higher workability, lightweight, lower cost, thermal and fire resistance relatively to conventional concrete. This study intends to measure the properties of FC incorporating bottom ash (BA) as fine aggregates (FA) and polypropylene fibers (PPF). A total of 18 concrete mixes were produced with two cement contents: 300 and 400 kg/m3. In addition, three foam agent contents (40, 50, and 60 kg/m3) and three PPF contents (0, 0.5, and 1% in terms of volume) were used and considered to investigate the physical, mechanical, thermal, and durability properties of PPF-reinforced FC incorporating BA. Furthermore, the effect of elevated temperature on the properties of specimens was also examined. Results show an increase in apparent porosity, water absorption, and sorptivity of FC with the increase in foam agent content. Conversely, a reduction in thermal conductivity, porosity, and shrinkage is observed with an increase in foam agent, cement, and PPF contents, respectively. The rise in foam agent content declines the mass loss while improves both compressive and flexural strengths of FC under an elevated temperature. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis of the FC specimens after exposure to the elevated temperature shows the cracks and inter-connected pores due to the thermal stresses by decomposing calcium silicate phases. Results show that all the FC mixes incorporating BA as FA and PPF can be used as moderate-strength concrete following American Concrete Institute guidelines, leading to enhanced FC performance and sustainable construction."
"Development of New Technologies for Real-Time Traffic Monitoring Robot; Random Trees; Artificial Potential Field Research and innovations in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) bring numerous benefits to local and global communities. ITS is defined as a system based on the application of contemporary computer and communication technologies into transport, to increase traffic efficiency, reduce pollution and other environmental effects of transport, and increase travelers' safety. The main goals of our research, reported here, are to improve the safety and efficiency of transport. We investigate a comprehensive solution that includes computer vision, Internet of Things (IoT), social media and AI control of the whole transport system. Autonomous vehicles and vehicular ad hoc networks are intelligent subsystems that will also be integral parts of future transport systems. This is expected to significantly improve traffic safety and throughput which will deliver sustainable economic and environmental benefits to the industry and the community. In alignment with vision zero approaches, we aim at zero human casualties on the road and fewer greenhouse gases emissions. Road transport safety is a critical topic of state, national and international importance, due to the health and safety of the community and serious environmental implications. Public opinion is extremely important in the changes to come and we are presenting here results from a survey that we have conducted."
"Professional networking for undergraduate students: a scaffolded approach Social Networking Sites; Social Media; Instagram Online social networking has changed how individuals communicate and associate. It facilitates building new relationships and maintenance of existing relationships. As the nature of work and career is changing, developing and maintaining relationships is essential for securing employment. Making social connections from the early stages of tertiary education is important to building and maintaining social capital. Graduate employability is an increasingly important outcome for universities and they have a key role in educating students regarding professional networking skills. The present study was designed to evaluate the development of such skills through in-class activities across a four-year programme. A pre-test-post-test design was used to compare data from 102 students on their awareness, confidence and use of LinkedIn (the largest professional networking platform). Prior to scaffolded in-class activities, students in years one and three reported little confidence and fourth-year students were the most confident using LinkedIn, although most students appreciated the importance of LinkedIn to their professional development and employment prospects. Following the in-class activities, all measures increased, up to five-fold in some year levels. Student responses to the open-ended survey questions complemented the quantitative analysis. The data suggests that embedding tasks that enhance professional networking into the curriculum can improve understanding of these platforms amongst students."
"A roadmap for systematically identifying opportunities in ecosystems using scientific publications data Technology Roadmapping; Data Mining; Technological Competitiveness Opportunity identification is a continuous process in ecosystems. However, ambiguities and challenges associated with knowledge exploration and exploitation can retard opportunity recognition processes. This in turn may culminate in excessive expenditure of resources or loss of latent opportunities. The present study adopts an analytical approach and proposes a methodological roadmap that utilizes scientometric and text mining techniques. The roadmap uses data from Web of Science as input, and generates insights that support decision-making about resource saving, strategic planning, investment, and policymaking. Our roadmap extends methods used in studying ecosystems by combining existing and novel techniques in data analytics. Using Python and VOSViewer, we show an exemplary application of the new roadmap, framed in the context of the Nordic countries' renewable energy ecosystem."
"Comprehensive Resilience Assessment of Complex Urban Public Spaces: A Perspective of Promoting Sustainability Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Complex urban systems, such as multi-floor rail transit stations and integrated railway transport hubs, are termed â€œcomplex urban public spacesâ€ (CUPSs). These CUPSs facilitate peopleâ€™s lives, but, at the same time, are threatened by various risks due to their multi-floor structure, dense crowds, high correlation in multi-function, complex facilities, and space openness. The risk events of CUPSs could have a negative influence on public safety and further influence sustainable development. Increasing the resilience of CUPSs is an effective way to respond to risks and guarantee public safety. Therefore, it is necessary to first assess the resilience of CUPSs. In this paper, a six-level comprehensive resilience indicator system was established based on aspects of the essence of resilience. Used in combination with the methods of resilience impact score and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process, the resilience value could be calculated. The Shenzhen North Railway Station (SZ) and the Guangzhou South Railway Station (GZ) were used to validate the proposed methodology. The established resilience indicator system was shown to be comprehensive and innovative, and, regarding practicality, the proposed assessment methodology is convenient to use. This research can help policymakers to assess the resilience of CUPSs and develop relevant policies to improve the resilience of buildings, which can further enhance urban sustainability."

"Recycled glass technology for cost effective green buildings Recovered glass fines are considered unsuitable for glass manufacturing due to particles either being too small or contaminated with
ceramic, stoneware, Pyrex and plastic. Only 48% of the annual glass waste of 257,000 tonnes generated in Victoria is recycled for glass
manufacturing (cullet glass) and the remaining (including glass fines) ends up at stockpiles. At present, the estimated stockpile of recovered glass in Victoria exceeds 300,000 tonnes and needs an efficient approach to minimise economic, social and environmental impact due to glass wastes and to find a viable market for its reuse. The current project aims to utilise recovered glass fines using a systematic approach that includes a rigorous experimental program and verification pilot trial with a model house built and monitored. The project outcomes will be commercialised by the lead industry partner through patents/IP protection that will add significant value to glass fines through application into constructing building components."

"Effects of distance from canal and degradation history on peat bulk density in a degraded tropical peatland Indonesia; Swamp Forest; Biomass Burning Over recent decades, the combination of deforestation, peat drainage and fires have resulted in widespread degradation of Southeast Asia's tropical peatlands. These disturbances are generally thought to increase peat soil bulk density through peat drying and shrinkage, compaction, and consolidation. Biological oxidation and fires burning across these landscapes also consume surface peat, exposing older peat strata. The prevalence and severity of deforestation, peat drainage and fire are typically greater closer to canals, built to drain peatlands and provide access routes for people. We compared bulk densities of 240 cm peat profiles from intact forests and degraded peatlands broadly, and also assessed differences between degraded peatlands near-to-canals (50â€“200 m from the nearest canal) and far-from-canals (300+ m from the nearest canal). The effects of vegetation type and fire frequency on bulk density, irrespective of the distance from canal, were also investigated. Mean bulk density values ranged between 0.08 and 0.16 g cmâˆ’3 throughout the 240 cm peat profiles. Drainage of peat near-to-canals increased bulk density of peat above the minimum water table depth. Degradation by deforestation and fire also increased bulk densities of upper peat strata, albeit with greater variability. Peat sampled further from canals experienced less intense water table drawdowns, buffering them from drainage effects. These areas were also more commonly forested and burnt less frequently. Differences in bulk densities below minimum water table levels are less clear, but may reflect lowering of the current peat surface in degraded peatlands broadly. These results clearly show that important differences in bulk density exist across degraded peatlands that are spatially dependent on distance from canals and disturbance history. These landscape features should be taken into account when designing future bulk density sampling efforts and peatland restoration programs, or when extrapolating from existing sources in order to make accurate inferences from them."
"Promoting sustainability of use of biomass as energy resource: Pakistan’s perspective Cooking Stoves; Solid Fuel Use; Cooking Biomass is primary source of energy for household in rural communities. Developing countries are focusing on increasing utilization of indigenous energy resources for energy security and to achieve sustainable development goal. Combustion of solid biomass is the primary approach for utilizing biomass to generate electricity and heat. Sixty-eight percent of population of Pakistan is living in rural areas while 30% population is still without electricity. The traditional household appliances used for cooking and heating are less efficient, more hazardous to users, and more damaging to the environment. Low carbon energy system prerequisites access to modern energy services. This paper presents an assessment of biomass resources potential in Pakistan as renewable energy resources and reviews potentials to adopt efficient use of biomass for cooking, heating, and small decentralized electricity generation. Objective of this study is to increase the sustainability of the use of biomass as source of energy in developing countries like Pakistan by an integrating energy-efficient and modern appliances and technologies that fit into a sustainable development path. Promotion of cleaner technologies and efficient use of biomass energy constitute appropriate strategies to mitigate global climate, health risks, and help in attending the targets set by sustainable development goal (SDG) to confirm worldwide access to reliable, affordable, and modern energy services by 2030."

"Redressing gendered undervaluation in New Zealand aged care: Institutions, activism and coalitions Political Representation; Quotas; Parliament This article explores the apparent conundrum of how, with minimal employment standards and limited equal pay laws, New Zealand managed to significantly redress the gendered undervaluation of low-paid aged care work. To draw out the pathways to these reforms, we focus on the long-term strategic coalitions that underpinned them. We examine, in particular, the activism of a diverse range of policy actors â€“ unions, employers, industrial and human rights bodies and civil society groups, which together have worked to â€˜undoâ€™ the limitations of equal pay and employment regulation. Our findings point to the benefits of strategic collaboration between policy actors in New Zealand and an approach which recognises the intersection of unequal pay with other gendered dimensions of disadvantage in aged care work. Different strategies used over time by diverse actors helped them overcome inadequate industrial and equal pay infrastructure to realise meaningful increases in hourly rates of pay, buttressed by improved working time arrangements and provision for career progression. We conclude by highlighting some lessons for institutional and policy actors in other national settings drawn from the New Zealand collaborative approach to equal pay in care work."

"A review on electrochemically modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) membrane for desalination and purification of water Multi Walled Nanotube; Adsorption; Graphene Oxide Recently extraordinary breakthroughs have been made towards applying nano-structured materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and porous graphene membranes in water purification and desalination applications. In this regard, the potential of the electrochemically active carbon nanotube (CNTs) membrane has been highly strengthened for the last few decades. One of the main advantages for such approach is the capability of CNT channel to permit the water flow easily. The perusal of the literature showed that, the performance of CNT based membrane can be three times higher than that of the conventional membrane devices. The unique and excellent characteristics of CNT membrane can outperform the conventional polymer membranes. CNT membrane has been widely used to adsorb chemical and biological contaminants as well as ion separation from sea water due to their high stability, great flexibility, and large specific surface area. Electrochemically active CNT filters deliver further Electro-oxidation of the adsorbed contaminants. Usually polymeric membranes have flexible chains for which it fails to have well-defined pores necessary for filtration. On the contrary CNTs based filters can provide pores with appropriate sizes and configurations by tailoring the growth parameters. The narrow pores of CNTs are capable of filtering water while eliminating ions (Na+/Cl-). Even this type of membranes is capable of removing bacteria from water and heavy hydrocarbon from petroleum. However, the success of desalination entirely depends on the basic design of the CNT-based filter with detailed optimization of the process parameters. Polymer filters cannot be recurrently used through several cycles since elimination of fouling ingredients is difficult. Even though electrochemically active CNT-based membranes have lot of advantages due to their hydrophobic nature, high porosity and specific area; there are numerous traits, which are yet to be considered and optimized. Thus the intrinsic properties of CNT as well as the fabrication of the membrane could be a critical factor for their applicability in various water treatment processes. This chapter provides an explicit and systematic overview of the recent progress of electrochemically active CNT membranes addressing the current prevalent problems associated with water treatment and desalination. The physio-chemical aspect including the working principles of this type of membrane have been discussed. The prevailing challenges and future perceptions are also discussed."
"Thermogravimetric analysis and carbon stability of chars produced from slow pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization of manure waste Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Large amounts of manure waste are produced worldwide. Land application of manure waste is the most common approach to valorization. This practice has several environmental concerns, including pathogen spreading, emissions of odorous chemicals (ammonia or methane) and the pollution of waterbodies with nitrogen and phosphorous compounds. The pyrolysis of manure for biochar production has been tested as a useful treatment to avoid these concerns but the high moisture of some wastes hinders its thermo-chemical valorisation in the absence of a pre-drying step. Recently, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of wet biomass has been identified as a cost-effective valorisation method of biomass without the need for energy-intensive drying processes. The objective of this study is to compare the properties of pyrochars and hydrochars prepared from thermal treatment of rabbit manure (MW). Pyrochars were prepared at 450 Â°C (BMW450) and 600 Â°C (BMW600) and hydrochars were obtained using a rabbit manure solution (solid:water ratio 30:70) that was heated at 190 Â°C (HMW190) and 240 Â°C (HMW240). The final temperature was maintained during 1 h for pyrochars and 6 h for hydrochars. Results showed that HTC generated more micro-, meso- and macro-porosity than pyrolysis. Pyrochar produced at 600 Â°C possessed a high thermal, chemical and biological stability, probably due to its highly aromatic structure. Hydrochars (HMW190 and HMW240) were predominantly aliphatic, and this was associated to a lower chemical and thermal stability than pyrochars. The germination index values indicated that the pyrochar BMW450 and the two hydrochars were highly phytotoxic while pyrochar MWB600 presented a moderate phytotoxicity, which was lower than the manure waste. Finally, CO 2 emissions of different materials after 60 days followed the order: MW > HMW190 > HMW240 > BMW450 > BMW600. Specifically, pyrolysis evolved CO 2 was reduced between 97.8âˆ’88.7% with respect to raw material after pyrolysis. The HTC treatment diminished evolved CO 2 between 68.8âˆ’59.0%, with respect to the manure. These results indicate that both processes can be considered as carbon fixation technologies."
"The impact of learner engagement on performance outcomes: a longitudinal study in accounting education Webcasts; Lectures; Videorecording This study explores the efficacy of vodcasting, as one of the advanced means of lecture recording, and discussion forums using retrospective engagement analytics data and performance outcome data on 1,172 unique students. The results provide partial support for the research hypotheses, particularly for international students, with learner engagement as a strong predictor of enhanced performance outcomes. However, no support was found for domestic students, with no significant impact of engagement on performance outcomes. That is, learner engagement may be more beneficial for international students than for domestic students. The findings support the implementation of discussion forums for enabling meaningful conversation, knowledge acquisition and peer engagement. This could pave the way for a knowledge-sharing culture as opposed to a knowledge-hoarding culture. Overall, the findings offer insights for higher education providers who have large international student enrolments and are interested in diversity management strategies and enhanced student engagement using disruptive technology."

"A smart mechatronic base isolation system using earthquake early warning Early Warning Systems; Earthquakes; Seismic In earthquake-prone countries such as Japan, effects of earthquakes are one of the major design objectives in buildings and infrastructures. Recent advances in earthquake engineering have improved the safety and reliability of buildings and infrastructures. Better understanding of geomorphology of earthquakes also enables us to better predict and estimate propagation of such natural hazard. For example, the Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system in Japan provides advanced warnings using the different arrival times of P and S waves. On the other hand, techniques and methods in passive, semi-active and active vibration control have flourished. Base-isolation is a proven technique which enhances earthquake resilience of buildings and bridges. In general, this technique involves decoupling a superstructure from its foundation and lengthens its natural period of vibration. This technique is mature and commercialization has taken place worldwide. However, wind-resistance of base-isolated structures is generally a concern as the lateral stiffness of a base-isolated structure is low and serviceability wind effects may induce unacceptable lateral movement and/or vibration of the structure. This paper presents a new concept which the base-isolation system is activated by EEW system through a mechatronic system. In other times the structure is not base-isolated and provides strong lateral resistance against wind loads. As a backup design, the proposed system also equips with its own network of accelerometers which can trigger base isolation system independent from EEW system. The smart mechatronic base isolation system is fully automated, and resets itself after each ground motion. The paper describes the conceptual framework of proposed system and presents laboratory-scaled proof-of-concept experiments. Four historical earthquake time histories were used as ground excitations. Structural responses are compared between the two triggering mechanisms and results are discussed. Finally, the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) which make use of EEW is discussed, allowing connectivity between a single control unit and a network of infrastructures to achieve economy of scale."
"Economic insecurity and gambling behaviours in Victoria in the COVID-19 society. COVID-19 has led to economic chaos across the globe with effects on financial markets, businesses and millions of households. The aim of this project is to understand the complex relationships between economic insecurity and gambling behaviours. The linkages between the macroeconomic environment and personal economic insecurity impact on individual health and wellbeing and can act as a trigger for gambling behaviours.
This project will explore these connections using a unique longitudinal dataset collected over a single calendar year, 2021. The purpose of the study is to establish how, and the channels through which: i) economic insecurity in the global economy, and ii) personal economic positions, work as leading antecedents of gambling harm. We will explore actual and perceived economic positions. COVID-19 has created economic uncertainty for many people including those still in active employment or those who have not suffered immediate loss; understanding the role of perceived (as well as actual) insecurity in promoting gambling harm is very important."
"Critical Evaluation of Building Defects Research: A Scientometric Analysis Reworks; Defects; Quality Management System The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry is a major contributor to national economic development across the world. However, this industry's development has been threatened by several issues, including defects. Building defects (BDs) can cause several problems including risks posed to life, personal safety, health, and project financial conditions. This review aimed to outline scholarly works that have examined various aspects of BDs and highlight the gaps in knowledge. The study presents the first comprehensive scientometric study evaluating contemporary research on BDs and their management. This research uses the science mapping method to analyze 712 bibliographic records extracted from Scopus for the last three decades. The study showed that there is a spike in the number of BD-related publications in the last decade. The results also indicated that the finite-element method and nondestructive examination have been the most widely used BD assessment methods. The study also found that cracks, corrosion, and surface defects have been the most commonly addressed topics. The primary value and uniqueness of this study lie in it being the first in providing an up-to-date inclusive, big picture of the literature on BD management. This research adds value to the AEC literature through visualizing and understanding trends and patterns identifying main research interests, journals, institutions, and countries, and how these are linked within now-available studies on BD. The findings of this research bring forward the gap in the current research and provide directions for future research, where they indicated that future research opportunities lie in exploring human factors on defects, thermal effects, and the root causes of defects in the building services, particularly in plumbing and drainage works. For the world of practice, the study offers a readily available point of reference for practitioners, policy-makers, and research and development bodies. This study, therefore, raises the level of awareness of BD management in the AEC industry."

"“I’m very visible but seldom seen”: consumer choice and use of mobility aids on public transport Self-Help Devices; Wheelchairs; Physical Disability Purpose: The number of mobility aid users continues to rise as the population ages. While mobility aid users rely on public transport due to its affordability, evidence suggests access can be difficult. This study aims to describe people who use mobility aids to access public transport and the role of public transport access in influencing mobility aid choice. Methods: Sixty-seven mobility aid users participated in telephone surveys which predominantly used a structured quantitative format. Data were analysed descriptively and any additional comments were simply categorized. Results: Thirty-six participants were female (54%), with a total sample mean age of 58.15 years (SD = 14.46). Seventy-two percent lived in metropolitan areas, 48% lived alone, and the sample experienced a variety of conditions including spinal cord injury (37%) and arthritis (18%). Sixty-four percent of all respondents used two or more mobility aids including powered wheelchairs, scooters and walking frames. The most important features when choosing a mobility aid were reliability, turning ability and size. Fifty-two percent of all respondents strongly agreed that public transport is generally accessible. Conclusions: While work continues to ensure that public transport vehicles and stations are fully accessible, mobility aid users must manage current infrastructure and access a system which has been shown through this research to have many limitations. Mobility aid users, vendors and health professionals need to work together to identify mobility aids that fulfil needs, and are reliable and safe, so that mobility aid users are both â€œvisible and seenâ€ when accessing the public transport network.Implications for rehabilitation Some mobility aid users experience difficulties accessing and using public transport and further research is required to ensure the whole public transport network is fully accessible to people using mobility aids. Many people have more than one seated mobility aid, suggesting people can choose different aids for different purposes and environments. Health professionals may need to increase their involvement in assisting individuals to select and use mobility aids."

"Involuntary excess reserve and heterogeneous transmission of policy rates to bank lending rates in China Money Market; Liquidity; Monetary Policy This study examines the impact of liquidity and involuntary excess reserves on interest rate pass-through in China. Employing Error Correction Model estimation based on a sample of 86 banks over the period of 2000â€“2013, the study finds that liquid banks can better shield against tightening monetary policy and adjust lending rate sluggishly. In contrast, banks with larger involuntary excess reserves tend to increase lending interest rates more rapidly in response to tightening monetary policy. We conclude that unwanted liquidity may lead to risk-taking behaviours which are detrimental to financial stability."
"Uncertainty as opportunity: the challenge of project based careers Career Success; Boundaryless; Employability Purpose: Current literature acknowledges the growth of careers in project management. The purpose of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the characteristics of those who choose and continue in project-based careers. Design/methodology/approach: Using social cognitive career theory as the lens to explore project management career journeys, 74 project practitioners were interviewed from across three broad industry sectors. A qualitative research approach was utilized and Atlas.ti was used to analyze and categorize the interview data collected. Findings: Those who choose to continue in project-based roles demonstrate high levels of self-efficacy and coping efficacy and see uncertainty as opportunity. They value challenge, flexibility and variety and take responsibility for their own career progression. Desire for employment security may vary according to personal circumstance. These findings are of value to employers in guiding selection and retention of people for project roles. Research limitations/implications: This is a qualitative and exploratory study covering only three industry sectors and results are not generalizable. SCCT was found useful as a lens for understanding the nature of project-based careers. Practical implications: Findings of this research provide valuable guidance for employers and HR practitioners in project-based organizations. For practitioners the study provides a useful framework for reflecting upon their own careers in projects. Social implications: The nature of careers is changing. Project-based careers are indicative of this change. This study therefore provides insight into an evolving phenomenon. Originality/value: This study expands our understanding of careers in projects, going beyond technical skill development to gain a deeper understanding of personal attributes that contribute to selection into and retention in project-based careers."
"Perception of embodied carbon mitigation strategies: The case of Sri Lankan construction industry Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Whilst operational carbon (OC) emission reduction has received greater attention in the literature, embodied carbon (EC) emission reduction aspect has been largely neglected. This is particularly seen in developing countries. This study assessed the awareness and perception of carbon emission in general and EC emission reduction strategies in particular in the Sri Lankan construction industry. A detailed questionnaire, based on a comprehensive literature review, was developed to assess the awareness and perception of the Sri Lankan construction professionals about global carbon emissions, OC emissions, and EC emissions and carbon mitigation strategies. Based on a sample of 111 professionals in the construction sector, results revealed that the Sri Lankan construction professionals have poor awareness about carbon emission, especially about EC emission and EC mitigation strategies. The results further revealed that they are more concerned about the OC emission reduction than the EC emission reduction. The results suggest that they are basically aware of some basic/conventional mitigation strategies such as better design (low-carbon), an extension of building life and refurbishment of existing buildings and carbon tax, but their awareness of recently introduced micro-level technologies/strategies is significantly poor. Findings are a clear reflection of the current situation in many developing countries with regard to carbon emission and mitigation strategies. It was found that a major reason for low awareness was related to the culture: The majority of the respondents believed that actions to reduce carbon footprint should be initiated and handled by the government and other authorities, but not by construction professionals."

"Fabrication of a Reusable Carbon Dot/Gold Nanoparticle/Metal-Organic Framework Film for Fluorescence Detection of Lead Ions in Water Myeloperoxidase; Colorimetric; Chromogenic Compounds Solid-state sensing platforms are desirable for the development of reusable sensors to promote public health measures such as testing for drinking water contamination. A bioinspired metal-organic framework (MOF)-based material has been developed by imitating metal-protein interactions in biological systems to attain high sensitivity and selectivity to Pb2+ through fluorescence sensing. A zirconium terephthalate-type framework (also known as NH2-UiO-66) was modified with both gold nanoparticles and thiol-functionalized carbon dots to give HS-C/Au(x)/UiO-66 composites with different Au content (x) and were subsequently adapted into films that show extraordinary sensitivity to Pb2+. The HS-C/Au(1.4)/UiO-66 film that consists of 1.4 wt % Au shows a quenching response with the limit of detection of 80 parts per trillion and sustained performance for five cycles. Moreover, the fluorescence response of the HS-C/Au(x)/UiO-66 film to Pb2+ can be reversed from emission quenching to enrichment of fluorescence by increasing the Au content. The performance of the HS-C/Au(x)/UiO-66 film as a solid-state sensor demonstrates its potential for application in reusable sensing devices to ensure public safety from Pb2+ contamination in drinking water."

"Novel Privacy Preserving Non-Invasive Sensing-Based Diagnoses of Pneumonia Disease Leveraging Deep Network Model Image Encryption; Cryptography; Hyperchaotic System This article presents non-invasive sensing-based diagnoses of pneumonia disease, exploiting a deep learning model to make the technique non-invasive coupled with security preservation. Sensing and securing healthcare and medical images such as X-rays that can be used to diagnose viral diseases such as pneumonia is a challenging task for researchers. In the past few years, patientsâ€™ medical records have been shared using various wireless technologies. The wireless transmitted data are prone to attacks, resulting in the misuse of patientsâ€™ medical records. Therefore, it is important to secure medical data, which are in the form of images. The proposed work is divided into two sections: in the first section, primary data in the form of images are encrypted using the proposed technique based on chaos and convolution neural network. Furthermore, multiple chaotic maps are incorporated to create a random number generator, and the generated random sequence is used for pixel permutation and substitution. In the second part of the proposed work, a new technique for pneumonia diagnosis using deep learning, in which X-ray images are used as a dataset, is proposed. Several physiological features such as cough, fever, chest pain, flu, low energy, sweating, shaking, chills, shortness of breath, fatigue, loss of appetite, and headache and statistical features such as entropy, correlation, contrast dissimilarity, etc., are extracted from the X-ray images for the pneumonia diagnosis. Moreover, machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and naive Bayes are also implemented for the proposed model and compared with the proposed CNN-based model. Furthermore, to improve the CNN-based proposed model, transfer learning and fine tuning are also incorporated. It is found that CNN performs better than other machine learning algorithms as the accuracy of the proposed work when using naive Bayes and CNN is 89% and 97%, respectively, which is also greater than the average accuracy of the existing schemes, which is 90%. Further, K-fold analysis and voting techniques are also incorporated to improve the accuracy of the proposed model. Different metrics such as entropy, correlation, contrast, and energy are used to gauge the performance of the proposed encryption technology, while precision, recall, F1 score, and support are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed machine learning-based model for pneumonia diagnosis. The entropy and correlation of the proposed work are 7.999 and 0.0001, respectively, which reflects that the proposed encryption algorithm offers a higher security of the digital data. Moreover, a detailed comparison with the existing work is also made and reveals that both the proposed models work better than the existing work."

"Relationship between perceived problem-solving skills and academic performance of novice learners in introductory programming courses Programmers; Hardware; Novice Past research has shown that student problem-solving skills may be used to determine student final exam performance. This study reports on the relationship between student perceived problem-solving skills and academic performance in introductory programming, in formative and summative programming assessment tasks. We found that the more effective problem solvers achieved better final exam scores. There was no significant difference in formative assessment performances between effective and poor problem solvers. It is also possible to categorize students on the basis of problem-solving skills, in order to exploit opportunities to improve learning around constructivist learning theory. Finally, our study identified transferability skills and the study may be extended to identify the impact of problem solving transfer skills on student problem solving for programming."
"Exploring tripartite praxis for the REDD + forest climate change initiative through community based ecotourism Destination; Ecotourism; Destination Management Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is a United Nations programme initiated in 2008 with the aim of mitigating climate change through the preservation of the worldâ€™s existing forest stocks. One of the challenges in its successful implementation has been community involvement in its design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The purpose of this study is to assess what REDD + can learn from the experience of Community-Based Ecotourism (CBET), which operates under many of the same conditions. A critical review of the related literature using the Scopus database was undertaken using three search strings including â€œREDD+â€ (2,913 listings), â€œcommunity-based ecotourismâ€ (113 listings) and â€œREDD + and tourismâ€ (6 listings) to identify the variables and themes related to each. Despite the significant increase in the number of publications on REDD + since 2008, only one was specifically related to ecotourism. We argue that CBET understood as a form of social capital can function as an enabling platform for REDD+, in particular its implementation of international conservation policy by working with local communities/indigenous peoples and business stakeholders, referred to here as the â€œtripartite praxisâ€. We demonstrate how CBET can act as a basis from which to guide internationally driven incentive-based conservation policy and community entrepreneurship within a social capital framework."

"Fiscal principles for self-organizing cities Optimal Taxation; Tax System; Nonlinear Income Taxation In â€˜Self-organizingâ€™ cities, decisions are based on the unhampered, peaceful, and honest choices of individuals, and governance, aside from penalizing coercive harm, is based on voluntary agreements. Self-organization has become an increasingly important topic in planning theory, as such processes enable urban systems to more effectively adapt to various stimuli and contextual needs over time. Self-organization may lead to emergent spatial configurations that are more in tune with individualsâ€™ values and preferences than the prevailing top-down approaches. The purpose of this article is to analyse how current tax systems impede emergent spatial configurations and, additionally, to explore what kind of fiscal rules and instruments are more supportive of creative (i.e. dynamically productive) processes of self-organization. The main finding is that the use of behavioural rules (such as contractual covenants and easements) and principles of taxation that do not distort the decentralized creation of value, such as user fees, congestion charges, and repayment of rental value received such as land value taxation, are superior to currently dominant approaches."

"Improving fermentation industry sludge treatment as well as energy production with constructed dual chamber microbial fuel cell Bioenergy; Regenerative Fuel Cells; Bioelectricity Microbial fuel cells offer a breakthrough for treatment of waste content coupled with energy generation. However, their applications are mostly limited to laboratories. Present research is focused on conducting the biological conversion of sludge originated from fermentation industry using microbial fuel cell (MFC). The efficiency of MFC was studied at different operating and nutritional conditions including pH, aeration rate and substrate concentration with biocatalyst Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The optimized conditions in terms of yielding maximum power density of 610 Â± 30 mW/m2 were reported at substrate concentration of 60% at 160 ml/min aeration rate and pH of 6, corresponding to a current density of 994 Â± 41 mA/m2. Results suggested that utilization of fermented sludge in MFC could give direction to handle the problem of fermentation industries and also to overcome a small fraction of energy crisis."
"Passengers’ perceived ability to get out safely from an underground train station in an emergency situation Pedestrian; Evacuation; Crowds Many recent studies have been done on the development of evacuation systems and plans. There are also several studies on human behaviour in fire. However, little research has been done to understand how peoplesâ€™ likely behaviour relates to their perceived ability to get out safely during an emergency, especially in a major transport hub like an underground train station. This study explores the beliefs and perceptions of 1134 train passengers and finds that those who report that they are likely to move to the exit immediately, wait for directions from the station staff, wait at assembly areas, help others with difficulties, choose the least crowded exit and/or use the escalators to get out also report that they expect to get out safely. In contrast, passengers who report that they are likely to do nothing and/or push others if necessary also report that they are less likely to get out safely."

The dragon versus the kangaroo: perceptions of Chinese and Australian influence and development assistance in Vanuatu Aid; Official Development Assistance; International Cooperation Chinaâ€™s engagement within the South Pacific has increased dramatically in recent years mainly through significant increases in development assistance. Development assistance is provided to address humanitarian needs but to also secure national interests of the donor. This paper examines the extent and nature of Australiaâ€™s and Chinaâ€™s influence in Vanuatu from the perspectives of the Ni-Vanuatu people using new data. China is perceived as having the most influence in the country despite Australiaâ€™s development assistance being viewed far more positively. Support for infrastructure is the most important factor contributing to a positive image for both countries. Perceptions of land grabbing are the main factor contributing to negative images.

"Inundation of a floodplain lake woodlands system: nutritional profiling and benefit to mature Eucalyptus largiflorens (Black Box) trees Black Box; Murraya; Salt Stress River management continues to challenge riparian systems worldwide, with climate change impacts and anthropogenic extractions escalating. The Murrayâ€“Darling basin (MDB) in Australia is critical to agricultural production and habitat provision to maintain biodiversity. Concern for the condition of native trees and biota in the MDB has led to substantial research investment to increase ecosystem function understanding and improve floodplain and wetland management. This field study offers new insights into tree nutrition and physiology as interpreted against the plant-soil-environment dynamics of recent flooding. Black Box (Eucalyptus largiflorens (Myrtaceae) is the only key native riverine MDB tree restricted to that region; and appears stressed at the far reaches of certain significant floodplain ecosystems. Here, nutritional and ecophysiological comparisons were made between Black Box trees that had just been inundated, and those nearby that had not. Leaf stomatal conductance, transpiration, total soil aluminium (Al) concentration, soil pH, and soil conductivity were different between inundated and dry sites. Soil moisture increased due to inundation, thus reducing tree water stress across the three study locations. Changes in leaf chemistry were not detected at the very early stages of flooding examined in this study. An increase in soil acidity due to inundation may also enhance bioavailability of nutrients to trees. New insight into immediate plant benefits gained from this study suggests further investigation is warranted to elucidate the influence of flood and drought on nutrient balance and how future wetland management can benefit from a more holistic understanding of plant-soil-environment dynamics."

"Factors influencing intention to adopt ICT among intensive shrimp farmers Shrimp Culture; Farmers; Aquaculture Intensive shrimp production has been considered one way to increase output quantity. However, many factors need to be considered to maintain product quality, sustained practice, and environmental compliance. The adoption of monitoring technologies in shrimp farming such as monitoring important water quality parameters including temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and salinity, offers several benefits, including increasing farming processes and cost efficiency and reducing harmful environmental impacts. A sampled survey dataset comprising 184 shrimp farmers from Ca Mau, Kien Giang, and Soc Trang provinces in Vietnam, one of the world largest shrimp producers, was used to examine factors that affect farmers' adoption of aquaculture information and communication technologies (ICT). The study empirically tested an adoption model using technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior under perceived production risks. Results suggest that farmers who both perceive the ICT as being useful in their shrimp farms and are influenced by other important peers are more likely to adopt aquaculture technologies. Farmers who feel confident to learn a new technology are likely to find the technology easier to use than someone who is not as confident. Due to the inherent risky nature of intensive shrimp production, even if Vietnamese shrimp farmers perceive a high level of technology-adoption risk, they still feel more confident towards learning to use a new ICT and its usefulness, and are therefore likely to increase their adoption. The study's results suggest ICT service providers should collaborate with local aquaculture departments to develop pilot farms to showcase new aquaculture technologies and demonstrate key features and their compatibility with existing farms' infrastructure, which will consequently entice farmers to quickly adopt shrimp monitoring technologies."

"Battery-free, skin-interfaced microfluidic/electronic systems for simultaneous electrochemical, colorimetric, and volumetric analysis of sweat Strain Sensor; Flexible Electronics; Sensor Wearable sweat sensors rely either on electronics for electrochemical detection or on colorimetry for visual readout. Non-ideal form factors represent disadvantages of the former, while semiquantitative operation and narrow scope of measurable biomarkers characterize the latter. Here, we introduce a battery-free, wireless electronic sensing platform inspired by biofuel cells that integrates chronometric microfluidic platforms with embedded colorimetric assays. The resulting sensors combine advantages of electronic and microfluidic functionality in a platform that is significantly lighter, cheaper, and smaller than alternatives. A demonstration device simultaneously monitors sweat rate/loss, pH, lactate, glucose, and chloride. Systematic studies of the electronics, microfluidics, and integration schemes establish the key design considerations and performance attributes. Two-day human trials that compare concentrations of glucose and lactate in sweat and blood suggest a potential basis for noninvasive, semi-quantitative tracking of physiological status."
"Codesigning participatory strategies with older adults to reduce perceived risk and promote digital inclusion As the COVID19 pandemic has highlighted, digital engagement is crucial in fostering social inclusion. Social exclusion is a significant threat to the wellbeing of older adults. One of the critical motivations for seniors’ lack of engagement with ICT and the digital economy, is perceived security risks. While online threats exist, seniors’ often base security concerns on perceptions of risk. This project adopts an innovative multidisciplinary approach that focusses on codesigning strategies with older adults to take into account their lived
experiences of ICT—connecting practice with perceptions. By managing perceived risks, seniors are better equipped to engage with the digital economy."

"Race, reconciliation, and justice in Australia: from denial to acknowledgment Intergroup; Collective Guilt; Forgiveness The harm perpetrated by the state of Australia against it Indigenous peoples has been structured, prolonged, and driven by race. In this paper, we conceptualize this harm and how it has been denied (and particularly how race has affected this harm and its denial). Although transitional justice literature has not traditionally been applied to an established democracy like Australia, we demonstrate why it is appropriate to apply transitional justice practices to the relationship between the Australian state and Indigenous peoples, and what transitional justice practices might provide in the Australian case. In particular, we argue that a transitional justice framework may allow Indigenous voices to name the harm inflicted on them, and position the state as acknowledging the harm that they have perpetratedâ€“bringing a fundamentally new relationship between the state and Indigenous peoples."

"Listening to Voices from the Margins: Transforming Environmental Education Intersectionality; Feminism; Social Location In the past, women, queer, Indigenous and disabled people, as well as race, class and body size issues, have been overlooked in most environmental education programs through being subsumed into the notion of â€œuniversalised people,â€ the â€œnorm.â€ However, people in each of these marginalised groups has a distinctive contribution to make to environmental education, as a form of anti-oppressive resistance, which needs to be foregrounded. In this chapter I problematize the relative silencing of queer theory and theorizing in environmental education and discuss the contributions that queer(y)ing perspectives bring to environmental education. In particular, I discuss some possibilities for new directions for environmental education where queer ecopedagogies and research, intersectionality and assemblages are used to listen to, and work with, â€œqueerâ€ voices."

"Estimation of environmental emissions and impacts of building construction – A decision making tool for contractors Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Building construction sites are responsible for significant energy consumption and emission production. The emissions at building construction stage vary from greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxides (CO2) to non-GHG emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) and sulphur dioxides (SO2). The construction emissions are often neglected due to the low amounts of emissions compared to high use phase emissions over the building life cycle. However studies have shown that these impacts from building construction can be significant at national and local level. Several difficulties and complications in estimation have restrained the possibility of effective decision making to minimise these emissions. Stakeholders in the construction industry seek the necessity of an emission calculation tool that enables the decision making in construction related emissions with minimum effort. The Construction Emission Evaluation Tool (CEET) presented in the study allows designers and contractors to estimate and compare emissions from the major emission sources in building construction. Emission analyses at project, equipment and activity levels provide in-depth scrutiny of emissions in minimising emissions and assisting the decision making for effective resource planning. Foundation construction corresponding to a case study is presented to demonstrate the functions and the capabilities of the developed calculation tool. The tool can provide a strong basis for the construction industry stakeholders and related researchers to make better decisions in maintaining a sustainable work environment. The study is also the initial step towards developing a sustainable decision making tool that can optimise cost, emissions and other construction related issues."

Triple Zero Kids Challenge GAME CONCEPTS
While three concepts are being presented, only a single game is intended to be fully developed within the context of this budget estimate and proposal. The final selection should be a balance of innovative technology, user engagement and measurable learning outcomes. The final choice to be determined at the conclusion of key stakeholderbplanning and/or workshops, with a functional specification being fully approved before development commences.

The following game concepts all draw upon user participation content, either as a volunteered individual or as multi-player within a group.
The presenter can either be the primary driver or allow the presentation to be more digitally automated. While the first two concepts could be facilitated without any technology requirements, being able to use technology as means of input and output, allows for a fun interactive learning environment and the capture of analytical data to measure reach and effectiveness.

As each school will have access to unique resources, all concepts will have recommendations for fallback options where technology in the school environment may be a challenge. However, it most cases it is assumed that a high percentage of schools will have at least access to a Smartboard and an internet connection. In some cases a mobile device with cellular access to the internet may be sufficient."

"Breakdowns in inter-organisational information sharing: The case of major incidents in Bangladesh Activity Theory; Psychological Practice; Self-Confrontation This study investigates breakdowns in information sharing among different actors involved in responding to major incidents such as police, fire, local government and NGOs. While previous studies on inter-organisational information sharing and collaboration in a disaster context have largely been undertaken in Europe, Australia and the USA; this study will focus on a developing country, Bangladesh, which faces both organisational and institutional challenges alongside a projected increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather-related disasters. The study adopts a qualitative case study approach of multiple organisations comprising observation, interviews and document analysis. Activity theory informs the study. A major contribution of this research will be a better understanding of how actors share information during major incidents and how the arising contradictions are resolved in practice. Theoretically, it will outline the contradictions in inter-organisational information sharing and how actors mitigate these contradictions during major incidents."

"Evaluating the effectiveness of increased landholder engagement for effective biodiversity management and reduced psychological distance of climate change Managing biodiversity on private land is an important part of maintaining landscape integrity and
resilience in the face of climate change (Harris et al. 2006). While the resilience of social?ecological
systems can be increased through biodiversity management (e.g. invasive species reduction,
conservation burning, reduced grazing), the influences of climate change may require alterations to
current management practices to ensure that management remains effective (Rissman et al. 2015).
Conservation covenantors represent a motivated group of landholders who are engaged in private land
conservation (PLC) and management (Selinske et al. 2015), however their management effectiveness is
put at risk by the effects of climate change. This in turn poses a risk to their conservation values, with
research having shown that covenantor satisfaction is influenced by their ability to manage their land
effectively and preserve the landscape in perpetuity (Selinske et al. in review). Satisfaction may also be
enhanced through the engagement of covenantors with a stewardship officer (Selinske et al. in review)."
"A disruptive model for delivering higher education programs within the context of entrepreneurship education Entrepreneurial Intention; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship Purpose: The purpose of this practitioner paper is to explore whether the principles of Design Thinking and the Lean Startup could be employed in developing a disruptive model for delivering educational programs within higher education in a way that attempts to eliminate the multitude of problems facing this industry, while simultaneously adhering to the principles of frugal innovation and meeting relevant sustainability goals. Design/methodology/approach: The authors followed a design thinking approach, employing tools such as empathy mapping, customer journey, value proposition and semi-structured interviews to obtain a deep level of understanding of the problems educators and students within the context of entrepreneurship education are facing. Throughout the process they drew on the practice of emergent inquiry and customer co-creation to help guide decision making. Findings: The authors successfully derived a conceptual solution in the form of a Minimum Viable Product of which the features were tested against the multitude of user needs and requirements. It was possible to demonstrate how the solution meets all nine of the requirements for frugal innovations while simultaneously adhering to applicable sustainability principles. Practical implications: The proposed solution offers a potential opportunity to first-movers in chosen academic disciplines to become leaders in online education. Originality/value: Even in an industry such as higher education there is a dire need for frugality and finding sustainable solutions for educators and students in both developed and developing markets. With this paper the authors succeed in presenting innovative combinations of digital artefacts, platforms and infrastructure to arrive at a novel crowd-sourced solution that is unique in its design."
"CFD analysis of environmental impacts on a thermochromic smart window Vanadium Dioxide; Metal-Insulator Transition; Thin Films Thermochromic (TC) glazing is an advanced smart window technology that can help to achieve nearly zero-energy buildings. The glazing temperature that affects TC thermo-optical properties directly impacts its energy-saving performance. However, the impacts of solar radiation and natural convection occurring on this temperature-sensitive material are not yet fully understood. Compared to previous focuses on material properties and energy evaluation, this study aimed to provide a different view from thermo-fluid dynamics on the heat transfer characteristics of a TC window, with impacts of environmental factors addressed. A validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model identifies the environmental impacts on the TC glazing temperatures under the coupled radiative and convective heat transfer. Furthermore, a theoretical model was developed with an empirical factor obtained from CFD results. It enables a simple calculation to obtain the TC glazing's temperature by using solar factors, outdoor temperatures and optical properties. The model suggests that the temperature difference between the TC glazing and the ambient is a function of absorbed solar irradiation (âˆqÌ‡total0.75). The predictive model is then tested using typical climate conditions in three cities in China with different solar angles, which demonstrates good agreement with an average absolute error of 5% compared to simulated glazing temperature. This estimation method can further assist in material design, product selection and Building Energy Simulations to achieve a TC window design that is â€˜smartâ€™ on seasonal change requirements for different regions."

"Ex vivo human organotypic brain slice cultures as a powerful tool to advance NeuroHIV cure strategies People living with HIV (PLWH) treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) still face neurological challenges. These challenges occur due to the inability of current anti-HIV treatments to eliminate the persistence of virus in the brain, which can lead to HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) that affect up to 69% of PLWH. Lack of relevant models of HIV central nervous system (CNS) infection (NeuroHIV) have precluded the use of effective anti-HIV treatments in the clinic that aims to eliminate persisting CNS virus and result in HIV cure. In this project, we will establish and validate the use of a biologically relevant 3D model of the brain, using human organotypic brain slice cultures (BSCs) derived from healthy brain tissue samples from patients undergoing resective epilepsy surgery or brain tumour resections at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Healthy brain slices will be grown in the laboratory under conditions to promote tissue
survival for up to 4 weeks. BSCs will eventually be infected with laboratory strains of HIV, where curative strategies to eliminate all persisting HIV in BSCs will be evaluated. BSCs represent an ideal model to test new anti-HIV cure strategies to eliminate persisting HIV that drives neurocognitive disorders, thus improving health outcomes for PLWH."
"Cooperation through Code: The social outcomes of blockchain technology This project aims to show the social consequences of using distributed ledger technology, including blockchains, for compliance, registries and regulatory processes. The project expects to generate new knowledge of how technology is changing administrative coordination between government and non-government entities. Expected outcomes include evidence of how blockchain technology is being applied to specific tasks and whether this improves on legacy systems. In addition to advancing social research on technological change, the project should provide benefits such as fairer strategies for effective regulation through technology, and an understanding of how these technologies in turn should be governed.
The project is expected to benefit civil society organisations by assisting them to understand the implications of blockchain technology for their existing processes and how they might use the technology for joint efforts. Benefits may include improving decision-makers’ ability to use this technology for more effective and efficient institutions. It may also assist with Australia’s preparedness for cyber security vulnerabilities stemming from social processes. The project is expected to help developers to understand how social factors can alter the effectiveness or outcomes of software protocols, and provide a framework for collaboration between social science and computer
science research."

"HIV latency can be established in proliferating and nonproliferating resting CD4 T cells in vitro: Implications for latency reversal Proviruses; Antiretroviral Therapy; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 To determine whether latency can be established and reversed in both proliferating and nonproliferating CD4 T cells in the same model in vitro.Methods:Activated CD4 T cells were infected with either a nonreplication competent, luciferase reporter virus or wild-type full-length enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter virus and cultured for 12 days. The cells were then sorted by flow cytometry to obtain two distinct T-cell populations that did not express the T-cell activation markers, CD69, CD25 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR: CD69CD25HLA-DR small cells (nonblasts) that had not proliferated in vitro following mitogen stimulation and CD69CD25HLA-DR large cells (which we here call transitional blasts) that had proliferated. The cells were then reactivated with latency-reversing agents and either luciferase or EGFP quantified.Results:Inducible luciferase expression, consistent with latent infection, was observed in nonblasts and transitional blasts following stimulation with either phorbol-myristate-acetate/phytohemagglutinin (3.8Â±1 and 2.9Â±0.5 fold above dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively) or romidepsin (2.1Â±0.6 and 1.8Â±0.2 fold above dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively). Constitutive expression of luciferase was higher in transitional blasts compared with nonblasts. Using wild-type full-length EGFP reporter virus, inducible virus was observed in nonblasts but not in transitional blasts. No significant difference was observed in the response to latency-reversing agents in either nonblasts or transitional blasts.Conclusion:HIV latency can be established in vitro in resting T cells that have not proliferated (nonblasts) and blasts that have proliferated (transitional blasts). This model could potentially be used to assess new strategies to eliminate latency."
"Lightweight Cryptographic Protocols for IoT-Constrained Devices: A Survey Fog Computing; Network Protocol; Internet of Things Internet of Things (IoT) is an emergent and evolving technology, interconnecting the cyber and physical worlds. IoT technology finds applications in a broad spectrum of areas such as homes, health, water and sanitation, transportation, and environmental monitoring. However, the endless opportunities and benefits of IoT come with many security challenges due to the reduced computation, communication, storage, and energy capabilities of the IoT smart devices. Several computationally lightweight cryptographic protocols exist for these resource-constrained IoT smart devices. However, lightweight solutions render the resource-rich ends of the IoT systems (e.g., edge, fog, or cloud modes) vulnerable as nodes at those ends have the capacity for computationally heavier cryptographic protocols, and they operate in relatively more malicious environments. This asymmetric computational nature of IoT systems requires security protocols that can adapt to the resource availability at the node that they operate. This survey describes the IoT structure, computational capabilities of the devices at the end, edge, fog, and cloud platforms, and classifies existing lightweight cryptographic protocols. The comparative analysis of the existing lightweight cryptographic solutions along with their advantages, drawbacks, and vulnerabilities highlights the need for elastic cryptographic protocols which are capable of adapting to the asymmetric capabilities of the different nodes in IoT systems."
"The sociocultural barriers of work-from-home arrangement due to COVID-19 pandemic in Asia: Implications and future implementation Personnel; Teleworker; Flexible Working The rapidly escalating COVID-19 pandemic entails many unprecedented life circumstances, including in the way people work. The social distancing policy has forced companies to adopt work-from-home (WFH) arrangement to maintain business sustainability amidst both health and economic crises. While in many developed countries, WFH arrangement has been a common practice, this is not the case in some Asian countries, particularly in countries where high power distance emphasising heightened supervision and punishment among workers are still a preferred managerial style, such as Indonesia, China, India, and Thailand. While acknowledging that WFH is considered as beyond an option in this pandemic period, this commentary paper, built on existing literature presented in the narrative fashion, aims to critically identify key barriers of WFH implementation in some Asian countries, particularly in autocratic societies, using both theoretical and contextual approaches. The paper concludes by discussing recommendation for future studies and proposing strategic implications for companies and workers to effectively adopt WFH arrangement, especially in societies where WFH is still a new practice or is involuntarily held."

"Climate change impact on urban flooding in Quynhon City, Vietnam Climate Change; CMIP; Regional Climate Flooding is one of the major problems in many cities. Adequate development of a drainage system is a primary measure the city used to deal with the problem. However, the risk of exceedance of design flood is more likely to increase due to the impact of urbanization as well as climate change. Changes in rainfall pattern and sea level rise increase the risks of inundation of city dwellings and amenities. This paper investigates the changing of flooding performances using the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) to describe the impact of climate change on drainage in Quy Nhon city, Vietnam. Climate scenarios are developed for future 2050 and 2100 by following the emissions proposed in IPCC representative concentration pathways (RCP) of greenhouse gases. The results examined the future flooding areas and their durations. It also highlights the inappropriateness in drainage design which could contribute to flooding increase in the city."

"Surprising Pseudogobius: Molecular systematics of benthic gobies reveals new insights into estuarine biodiversity (Teleostei: Gobiiformes) Animals; Maccullochella Macquariensis; Percichthyidae Snubnose gobies (genus Pseudogobius: Gobionellinae) are ubiquitous to, and important components of, estuarine ecosystems of the Indo-west Pacific. These small benthic fishes occur in freshwater, brackish and marine habitats such as mangroves, sheltered tide pools and lowland streams, and represent a model group for understanding the biodiversity and biogeography of estuarine fauna. To develop the species-level framework required for a concurrent morphological taxonomic appraisal, we undertook thorough sampling around the extensive Australian coastline, referenced to international locations, as part of a molecular systematic review using both nuclear and mitochondrial markers. The results indicate that while there are currently eight recognised species, the true diversity is close to double this, with a hotspot of endemism located in Australia. Complicated patterns were observed in southern Australia owing to two differing zones of introgression/admixture. Key drivers of diversity in the group appear to include plate tectonics, latitude, and historic barriers under glacial maxima, where an interplay between ready dispersal and habitat specialisation has led to regional panmixia but frequent geographic compartmentalisation within past and present landscapes. The findings have significant implications for biodiversity conservation, coastal and estuarine development, the basic foundations of field ecology, and for applied use such as in biomonitoring."
"Linking leader-member exchange and work–nonwork balance: the mediating role of thriving at work and the moderating role of gender Work-Family Conflict; Work-Life Balance; Personnel Purpose: The authors tested (1) the mediating role of thriving in the association between leader-member exchange (LMX) and workâ€“nonwork balance (WNWB) and (2) the moderating effect of gender in the relationship between LMX and thriving. Design/methodology/approach: Cross-sectional data were collected from six separate participant groups across an eight-month period (n = 522). Data analysis included confirmatory factor analysis to assess the construct validity of the proposed three-factor model. Hierarchical regression and the PROCESS macro were used to test three hypotheses. Findings: The authors found thriving mediated an indirect effect of LMX on WNWB. In addition, we found that the relationship between LMX and thriving was moderated by gender, such that the relationship was found for females. Overall, the authors identified a moderated-mediation effect indicating an indirect effect of LMX on WNWB via thriving for females. Research limitations/implications: Cross-sectional design suggests their results are theory driven. The authors suggest future studies replicate the study employing experimental designs. Practical implications: The authors suggest organisations develop programs to enhance leadership and thriving capabilities as tools to manage WNWB. Originality/value: The authors add to the thriving literature by revealing gender differences in the effectiveness of relational resources (i.e. LMX) in fostering employee thriving. Furthermore, the authors extend the efficacy of thriving beyond the workplace to include WNWB. The authors demonstrate the skills and knowledge acquired at work can be used to lessen the impact of WNWB."
"Digital technologies as enablers of supply chain sustainability in an emerging economy Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices Vietnam is a country with significant potential for growth as a global centre for manufacturing, as supply chains look to reduce their over-reliance on China in the aftermath of COVID-19. The objective of this study is to better understand the current adoption rates and growth potential of emerging Industry 4.0 (I4.0) digital technologies and ascertain their potential to drive successful future sustainability initiatives amongst Vietnamese supply chain firms. These technologies offer a wide range of sustainability benefits, from a potential to reduce waste production and lower energy consumption to increased opportunities for recycling and industrial symbiosis. This empirical study surveys 223 Vietnamese supply chain experts to learn how digital technologies are being utilized in that region, what levels of future investment are expected, what preparatory measures are being taken to leverage new technologies, and what scope for improved supply chain sustainability exists. The findings indicate a low level of I4.0 digital technology adoption amongst Vietnamese supply chain firms, with the Internet of Things (IoT) currently being the most prevalent (48 percent adoption rate). Drones, Big Data Analytics and IoT are the I4.0 digital technologies expected to have the greatest future impact on Vietnamese supply chains. Whilst I4.0 digital technology adoption is still at this early stage, that may present a greater opportunity for driving future sustainability outcomes, than interrupting and retrofitting solutions to already-established networks and infrastructure."

"Taking a Partnered Approach to Managing Academic Stress: An Undergraduate Study Psychological Resilience; Resiliency; Mental Health The ability to positively adapt to situations of stress and adversity enables student progress, growth, and learning. In the context of undergraduate building and construction education in the United States, little is known about the resources necessary for students to manage stressors associated with their studies. Twenty undergraduate building and construction students from a large, public land-grant university in the United States were interviewed. Inductive thematic analysis was used to explore the antecedents and impacts of academic stress, and deductive thematic analysis was used to identify resilience-building resources using the Resilience at University (RAU) framework. Resources identified to reduce stressor severity were focused on modifying the learning environment and implementing a scaffolded approach to learning and skills development. Resilient-building resources aligned with the six dimensions of the RAU were identified at the student level and the university level. An important contribution is the pivotal role of the studentâ€“university partnership in managing academic stress and building student resilience capability, acknowledging both students and the university as key actors. The findings will be of interest to educators and students who can implement a partnered approach to reduce the prevalence of academic stressors together with building studentsâ€™ capacity to manage stress."

"Data driven optimization for electric vehicle charging station locating and sizing with charging satisfaction consideration in urban areas Electric Vehicles; Charging; Station The lagging development of charging infrastructure seriously restricts the penetration of electric vehicles. Inadequate and unreasonably setting of charging stations (CS) aggravates charging anxiety of electric vehicle(EV) users. Location and sizing model is developed to expand existing CS to maximize EV charging service satisfaction in urban areas. The model captures charging behavior from massive GPS trajectory extraction data of electric taxis. Satisfaction from EV users with charging service is measured by whether the respond time from an electric vehicle driver issuing charging demand signal to completion of charging is within a threshold value. The respond time is considered to include seeking time, queuing time and charging time, which are determined by the decisions of the CS location, capacity and charging types. Heuristic algorithms, including the greedy, greedy-substitute and two-layer genetic algorithms, are designed to solve the problem. Algorithms are simulated in a large scale random computational environment. Finally, a practical case of Shenzhen is investigated. It is found that charger pooling is more effective than decentralized layout. Moreover, it is critical to weigh the cost and charging rate of different types of chargers with budget restriction. High charging rate chargers are not necessarily effective than slow ones in reducing charging respond time."
"Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid Enhanced Membrane Bioreactor (eMBR) System Treating Synthetic Textile Effluent Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling The textile industry produces a high volume of wastewater rich in toxic and harmful chemicals. Therefore, it is necessary to apply wastewater treatment methods such as membrane bioreactor (MBR) to achieve high efficiency, process stability, small footprint, and low maintenance costs. This work performed a study on a synthetic textile wastewater treatment using an enhanced membrane bioreactor (eMBR) equipped with two anoxic and one aerobic reactor and a UV disinfection unit. The results showed 100% removal of total suspended solids, 81.8% removal of chemical oxygen demand, and 96% removal of color. The SEM analysis indicated that the pores of the membrane were blocked by a compact and dense gel layer, as observed by the presence of the fouling layer. According to these results, an eMBR hybrid system is a suitable option for treating synthetic textile wastewater. Opportunities to increase the efficiencies in the removal of some pollutants, as well as stabilizing and standardizing the process are the improvements which require further investigations."

"Counting the Costs of Public Housing Estate Redevelopment in Melbourne: A comparison of delivery options Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Since 2001, social housing levels, traditionally a safety net for low-income households, have stagnated in Victoria. To increase social housing levels, the Victorian state government announced a programme to redevelop ageing public housing estates through publicâ€“private partnerships. This study compares private sector, community housing sector, and government-led redevelopment models, to determine which provides the best value for money method of redevelopment. Importantly, considering the Victorian governmentâ€™s plans to increase social housing levels post-COVID19, the study found that the government is best placed to deliver social housing, due, in part, to lower borrowing costs and no requirement for making profit."

"Prospects of developing prefabricated masonry walling systems in australia Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Prefabrication has been shown to be an effective way of construction in the modern-day context. Although much progress has been made in developing reinforced concrete (RC), timber and steel prefabricated elements/structures, prefabrication of masonry walling systems has received limited attention in the past. Conventional masonry construction is labour-intensive and time-consuming; therefore, prefabrication can be an effective solution to accelerate the masonry construction to make it more cost-effective. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt has been made to evaluate the effectiveness of prefabricated masonry systems (PMS) in terms of their structural characteristics and sustainability perspectives in an Australian context. Subsequently, the available studies related to PMS and the prospects of developing prefabricated masonry walling systems were appraised and reported. In order to assess the applicability of PMS, a case study was carried out by designing four types of prospective prefabricated masonry walling systems for a typical housing unit in Australia. It was shown that the reinforced (RM), post-tensioned (PT) and thin layered mortared (TLM) masonry systems are better suited for prefabrication. Later, in order to assess the sustainability of the considered masonry walling systems, life cycle energy analyses were carried using the Environmental Performance in Construction (EPIC) database. It was found that there can be nearly 30% and 15% savings, respectively, in terms of energy saving and CO2 emissions in prefabricated construction than the conventional masonry construction. Finally, the prospects of developing PMS and the need for future research studies on these systems are highlighted."
"Gender violence: marketplace violence and symbolic violence in social movements Mental Health; Sexual And Gender Minorities; Sexual Behavior Drawing on a retrospective case study involving LGBTQ populations and the tobacco industry, we demonstrate how a duplicitous stance by Big Tobacco illuminates the ways that symbolic violence is perpetrated on consumers. We define marketplace violence as the actions and narratives of powerful market actors that perpetuate inequalities that less powerful market actors experience. This research delineates how marketplace relationships perpetuate gender and sexual orientation discrimination, and how powerful market actors engage in invidious action under the guise of community support, thereby undermining community-based social movements."

"Oxygen functionalized porous activated biocarbons with high surface area derived from grape marc for enhanced capture of CO2 at elevated-pressure Carbon Dioxide Capture; Tetraethylenepentamine; Adsorption This research demonstrates the conversion of grape marc into highly carbonaceous and oxygen functionalized porous activated biocarbons (PABs) with a high specific area for CO2 capture. The materials are synthesized using KOH activation at 800 Â°C and show a high content of micropores and high specific surface areas which can be easily manipulated by varying the amount of KOH. The optimized material PAB3 obtained using KOH/grape marc biochar ratio of 3 displays the highest specific surface area (2473 m2 gâˆ’1), high micropore volume (0.72 cm3 gâˆ’1) and a pore diameter of 0.74 nm. Owing to its highly developed porosity and excellent textural parameters, PAB3 exhibits a high CO2 adsorption of 6.2 mmol gâˆ’1 at 0 Â°C/1 bar and 26.8 mmol gâˆ’1 at 0 Â°C/30 bar. It is often considered challenging to synthesize a CO2 adsorbent with all-round performance for CO2 capture under diverse conditions of temperature and pressure. The optimized material PAB3 is also found to be thermally stable which when coupled with its superior CO2 capture performance presents a promising candidature in the field of carbon capture. Furthermore, the excellent features of the synthesized material suggest that these materials could be extended to several other adsorption related fields."
"Challenges and enablers of women entrepreneurs’ career advancement in Vietnam’s coffee industry Migrant Workers; Self-Employment; Ethnic Business Purpose: This paper aims to explore the motivational factors and contextual facilitators of female entrepreneurs in Vietnamâ€™s coffee industry and also the barriers facing them. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts the grounded theory approach, using semi-structured in-depth interviews with 31 women entrepreneurs in the coffee industry in the rural Central Highlands of Vietnam. Findings: This study found that necessity-driven factors play an important role in motivating female entrepreneurs to advance their careers. However, these factors may be transformed into the opportunity-driven motives. Furthermore, the findings suggest that Asiaâ€™s collectivism culture and family support significantly affect the success of the women entrepreneurs, although gender inequality is not perceived as a serious constraint in entrepreneurial activities. Research limitations/implications: This study has implications for the literature of women entrepreneurs regarding motivations and contextual influences in agricultural and rural areas of Vietnam. However, the sample size is relatively small which limits the concept generation of the study. For further research, a larger sample size with different business sectors should be considered to generate more explicit findings. Practical implications: The findings from this study can assist the policymakers in developing strategies and governmental policies to support the career advancement of women entrepreneurs and improving gender equality in Vietnam. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature about understanding the motives and the roles of socioeconomic contexts in womenâ€™s entrepreneurial activities in agricultural and rural areas."

"An Overall Distribution Particle Swarm Optimization MPPT Algorithm for Photovoltaic System under Partial Shading Maximum Power Point Trackers; Powerpoint; Solar Cell Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems under partial shading conditions (PSCs) have a nonmonotonic P -V characteristic with multiple local maximum power points, which makes the existing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms unsatisfactory performance for global MPPT, if not invalid. This paper proposes a novel overall distribution (OD) MPPT algorithm to rapidly search the area near the global maximum power points, which is further integrated with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) MPPT algorithm to improve the accuracy of MPPT. Through simulations and experimentations, the higher effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed OD-PSO MPPT algorithm in solar PV systems is demonstrated in comparison to two existing artificial intelligence MPPT algorithms."

"Introduction: Early childhood education policy reforms in Australia and China Comparative Education; China; UNESCO This chapter introduces early childhood education, policies and reforms and a collaborative partnership to explore comparative perspectives in early childhood across Australia and China. In this book we draw on the research literature to develop a picture of early childhood education in the two countries and to provide background and context. Early childhood education has been identified by governments and policy makers as a strategy to counter inequality and support economic growth. Continuous reform, in terms of access, quality of the services provided and the training required by the workforce are a focus of policy development and also the subject of the research projects described in this book. The value of comparative studies is discussed and the usefulness of exploring early childhood education and care initiatives across borders contemplated. Debates in Australia and China have been introduced in order to reflect on the influence of internationalisation and globalisation in shaping educational policy, practice and relationships. This introduction describes the organisation of the book, comments on the nuanced nature of comparative studies when knowledge is shared across borders and touches on some of the questions that arise from the research projects reported upon."

"Regulatory influence on sustainability reporting: evidence from Murray–Darling Basin Authority in Australia Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the sustainability reporting of a public sector organisation (PSO). This study focuses on socio-environmental practices of a major agro-economic platform in Australia â€“ the Murrayâ€“Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) to provide a unique perspective on water resource management and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This longitudinal qualitative case study collects published data from the MDBAâ€™s annual reports over 21 years (1998â€“2018) and considers economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability using legitimacy and institutional theory. Findings: This study finds that the MDBAâ€™s sustainability reporting is influenced by its response to the Water Act 2007 and the Basin Plan 2012 regulations and to maintain its legitimacy with stakeholders. The MDBA wished to pursue sustainability through integrating these regulations complemented by stakeholder expectations. Although all categories increased in reporting, the environment category has the highest primacy in achieving a healthy basin through sustainable water management for the long-term benefit of the stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the PSOs sustainability reporting literature. Particularly, this study provides insights of sustainability reporting patterns and practices over a long period through a longitudinal study. This study contributes new knowledge on the awareness of PSOs sustainability practice which has implications for governments, regulators, policymakers, managers and other stakeholders. Originality/value: The Australian PSOs setting is under-researched from the perspective of a regulatory framework. The MDBA case provides unique insights on water resource management and sustainability which has value for many countries around the world."

"Bioacoustic monitoring of frog populations The project is designed to trial bioacoustic monitoring as a survey method for recording and analysing frog calls to determine the in situ status of frog populations. The field locations are initially to be along the fringe of Melbourne's northern suburbs. The significance of this project is the opportunity to develop a more representative, less invasive frog survey method. Potential sites are identified and the monitoring is expected to continue over several seasons. The project will focus on the Growling Grass Frog Litoria raniformis but will include all frog species that may potentially be found at the trial sites. The bioacoustic monitoring is proposed to run concurrently with standard monitoring (desktop surveys and site visits) allowing the two methods to be compared. A digital reference library based on the acoustic characteristics of each species calls will be created. The recording frequency schedule, duration of recording and optimal recorder siting will be developed. Other site data will be recorded including water chemistry as will climate information from nearby Bureau of Meteorology weather stations. It is expected that this research will contribute towards frog conservation by developing a frog survey method that will potentially increase the accuracy of identifying frog species diversity."

"Developing BASEScope: a method to detect replication competent HIV for HIV cure research Despite the outstanding success of antiretroviral therapies for HIV infection, these drugs do not cure HIV and treatment is lifelong. Recent research has focussed on the possibility of a cure for HIV. The major barrier to HIV cure is the virus's ability to effectively 'hide' within tissues and blood in the infected individual. This virus lays dormant, effectively evading the immune system and antiretroviral therapy. Cessation of antiretroviral therapy allows the virus to rebound and the patient once again become viremic, potentially leading to HIV
disease progression. A major obstacle to clinical trials aimed at eliminating the virus from these dormant sites is the lack of assays/ technologies to quantitate and monitor the size and location of these sites effectively. HIV BaseScope offers a promising highly sensitive technology that can detect and quantify the virus present in these sites to guide the effectiveness of cure clinical trials."

"Reconfiguring spatial boundaries and institutional practices: Mobilizing and sustaining urban low carbon transitions in Victoria, Australia Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Carbon and efforts to decarbonize are reconfiguring urban processes and relations. As we witness increasing numbers and ranges of low carbon urban experiments attention inevitably turns to how they are sustained (CastÃ¡n Broto and Bulkeley, 2013a) and how, as part of this process of sustaining, urban low carbon intermediaries (Guy et al., 2011; Hodson et al., 2013) at the local scale operate across existing boundaries, between civil society, policy and the private sector, in deliberative ways. In this chapter we develop earlier work (Moloney et al., 2010; Horne and Dalton, 2014; Moloney and Horne, 2015; Moloney and Funfgeld, 2015) focusing on the role of emerging quasi-government networks operating as intermediaries within and between not-for-profit, government and business organizations and across spatial and jurisdictional boundaries. We propose that the ways in which these types of organizations create spaces for experimentation across local government boundaries - through projects, relations and strategies - can be understood as intermediation, and that this is particularly important work in weak institutional settings, where climate change policy is contested and interests are distributed. It is in this highly contested and fragmented domain of low carbon governance that we identify the characteristics of their work as constituting forms of intermediation (Hodson and Marvin, 2010) by coordinating the development of regional climate change plans and strategies; establishing progressive coalitions seeking to transform socio-technical systems; advocating for coordinated, systemic and effective responses to climate change across multiple scales; and seeking to align and legitimize low carbon agendas across local governments, businesses and civil society in their particular regions."

"Anticancer activity of Momordica cochinchinensis (red gac) aril and the impact of varietal diversity Momordica Cochinchinensis; Carotenoid; Lycopene Background: Momordica cochinchinensis (Cucurbitaceae) is a nutritionally and medicinally important fruit restricted to South East Asia with diverse morphological and genetic variations but there is limited information on its medicinal potential. Methods: M. cochinchinensis aril from 44 different samples in Australia, Thailand and Vietnam were extracted using different solvents and tested for its anticancer potential. Anticancer activity of M. cochinchinensis aril on breast cancer (MCF7 and BT474) and melanoma (MM418C1 and D24) cells were compared to control fibroblasts (NHDF). The cytotoxicity of the cells following treatment with the aril extract was determined using CCK-8 assay. Biochemical and morphological changes were analysed using flow cytometry, confocal and transmission electron microscopy to determine the mechanism of cell death. Results: The water extract from the aril of M. cochinchinensis elicited significantly higher cytotoxicity towards breast cancer and melanoma cells than the HAE extract. The IC50 concentration for the crude water extract ranged from 0.49 to 0.73 mg/mL and induced both apoptotic and necrotic cell death in a dose- and time-dependant manner with typical biochemical and morphological characteristics. The greatest cytotoxicity was observed from Northern Vietnam samples which caused 70 and 50% melanoma and breast cancer cell death, respectively. Conclusions: The water extract of M. cochinchinensis aril caused significant apoptosis and necrosis of breast cancer and melanoma cells, with varieties from Northern Vietnam possessing superior activity. This highlights the potential of this fruit in the development of novel anticancer agents against such tumours, with specific regions on where to collect the best variety and extraction solvent for optimum activity."

"Photodegradation of emerging contaminants in a sunlit wastewater lagoon, seasonal measurements, environmental impacts and modelling Dissolved Organic Matter; Photodegradation; Water The seasonal sunlight-induced photodegradation of seven emerging contaminants (ECs) in a municipal wastewater treatment lagoon was examined in a lab-scale study over a year. There were obvious seasonal trends for the degradation rates of all the ECs in both ultrapure water and lagoon wastewater matrices with strong correlations (R2 = 0.65-0.90) between sunlight irradiance and their degradation rates in pure water, indicating the dominant influence of natural sunlight intensity. This suggests the importance of recording light source conditions for the purposes of data interpretation and modelling of sunlight-induced photolysis. It was demonstrated that photolysis of these ECs was likely to occur only within the first 10 cm of the lagoon surface. Strongly temperature dependent photodegradation was observed for the five ECs which primarily underwent indirect photolysis in the lagoon wastewater, and activation energy values (which could be used for simulation of the photodegradation process) were obtained for these compounds. The quantum yields of the ECs were determined under wastewater-relevant pH conditions. The APEX environmental model was adjusted to simulate the photodegradation of these ECs in the lagoon wastewater. The predicted results were largely in agreement with the seasonal measurements, with some overestimated photodegradation rates obtained for winter, suggesting that temperature should be included as a factor for modelling the photolysis of ECs. These results indicate that there is potential to establish a model to predict the photodegradation of a wide range of ECs in wastewater treatment lagoons to facilitate risk assessment of the treated wastewater."

"Quantifying the “avoided” biodiversity impacts associated with economic development Conservation Banking; Environmental Protection; Compensatory Measure Achieving global sustainability objectives such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals or Aichi Targets, including remaining within planetary boundaries, necessitates proactively avoiding a proportion of the environmental impacts otherwise expected to result from economic development. Quantifying these â€œavoidedâ€ impacts is important for monitoring progress toward meeting sustainability objectives, but doing so in a consistent way is fraught with difficulty. Using the mitigation of biodiversity impacts by development projects as an example, we explored the challenges of defining and measuring impact avoidance. Avoidance can be defined as either action-based or outcome-based, and classified by whether it is achieved through project cancellation, spatial avoidance, design-based avoidance, or temporal avoidance. We also examined what drives different types of project proponents to implement avoidance measures. To support empirical quantification of the contribution that avoidance makes toward conservation goals, we present a framework for structuring assessments of biodiversity impact avoidance. Our framework has widespread applicability in conservation science, policy, and practice, as well as relevance for broader policies that seek to avoid environmental and social impacts."

"The potential of sentinel satellites for large area aboveground forest biomass mapping Lidar; Tree Crown; Canopy Height Estimation of aboveground forest biomass is critical for regional carbon policies and sustainable forest management. Both passive optical remote sensing and active microwave remote sensing can play an important role in the monitoring of forest biomass. In this study, the recently launched Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument satellite and Sentinel-1 SAR satellite systems were evaluated and integrated to investigate the relative strengths of each sensor for mapping aboveground forest biomass at a regional scale. The Australian state of Victoria, with its wide range of forest vegetation was chosen as the study area to demonstrate the scalability and transferability of the approach. In this study aboveground forest biomass (AGB) was defined as the tons of carbon per hectare for the aboveground components (stem, branches, leaves) of all live large trees greater than 10 cm in diameter at breast height (DBHOB). Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data were fused within a machine learning framework using a boosted regression tree model and high-quality ground survey data. Multi-criteria evaluations showed the use of the two independent and fundamentally different Sentinel satellite systems were able to provide robust estimates (R 2 of 0.62, RMSE of 32.2 t.C.ha -1 ) of aboveground forest biomass, with each sensor compensating for the weakness (cloud perturbations and spectral saturation for Sentinel 2, and sensitivity to ground moisture for Sentinel 1) of each other. As archives for Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 continue to grow, mapping aboveground forest biomass and dynamics at moderate resolution over large regions should become increasingly feasible."

"Assessing the visual impacts of new urban features: coupling visibility analysis with 3D city modelling Digital Elevation Model; Visibility; Bronze Age Crete Land use changes associated with urbanization often have negative impacts on scenic beauty. In this paper, we explore and compare the visual impact of two different scenarios of urban growth including historical urban growth (HUG) and aesthetically sound urban growth (AUG) with two different categories of height for buildings in the city of Gorgan, Iran. This was done by viewshed and landscape metric analysis of different viewpoints and 3D representation of each scenario. The results show that with the AUG scenario, viewsheds are less impacted by new developments than the HUG scenario in all the viewpoints. It can be concluded that building locations can considerably affect the landscape visibility while building height does not impact to the same degree as location. The results of this research, as a Spatial Decision Support System, would help the managers for better understanding of different patterns of urbanization and its effect on landscape view."

"Bioaccumulation kinetics of cadmium and zinc in the freshwater decapod crustacean Paratya australiensis following multiple pulse exposures Assimilation Efficiency; Bioaccumulation; Cadmium Stormwater runoff has been identified as a major source of metal contaminants in urban waterways, where during storm events organisms tend to be exposed to short-term pulses, rather than a constant exposure of contaminants. Current water quality guidelines (WQGs) are generally derived using data from continuous exposure toxicity tests, where there is an assumption that chronic exposures provide a meaningful way of assessing the impacts and effects in organisms as a result of these pulsed storm events. In this current study the radioisotopes 109Cd and 65Zn were used to explore uptake, depuration and organ distribution in the decapod crustacean Paratya australiensis, over three short-term (<10 h) exposures. Exposures to radiolabelled cadmium only, zinc only or a mixture of cadmium and zinc were followed by depuration in metal- and isotope-free water for 7 days. Whole-body metal concentrations were determined by live-animal gamma-spectrometry and an anatomical distribution of the radioisotopes was visualised using autoradiography post-mortem. Both metals were significantly accumulated over the pulsed exposure period. In both treatments cadmium and zinc body burden increased at the same rate over the three pulses. Final metal body burden did not markedly differ when shrimp were exposed to metals individually compared to a binary mixture. Over the course of the depuration period, cadmium efflux was minimal, whereas zinc efflux was significant. Autoradiography indicated the presence of both metals in the gills and hepatopancreas throughout the depuration period. These results demonstrate how short-term repeated exposures result in the accumulation of contaminants by shrimp. This study highlights the importance of considering the inclusion of pulsed toxicity tests in frameworks when deriving WQGs."
"Feasibility of net zero energy high rise apartment buildings in Australia Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation Net-Zero Energy (NZE) buildings are gaining popularity globally as a solution to reduce operational energy usage and limit greenhouse gas emissions in the building industry. Their deployment is occurring rapidly as many countries are planning to make it mandatory for new developments. Despite the advancements in research in the various aspects of NZE, significant barriers do exist to its successful adoption and implementation, particularly with respect to high-rise residential buildings which are becoming a major portion of the housing supply in Australia. One of the challenges attributed to the achievement of NZEB performance is the uncertainty involved in selecting appropriate solution strategies that could deliver quality performances. This paper investigated strategies that can deliver NZE performance for high-rise residential buildings in Australia. A calibrated model of 26 storey high-rise apartment building with 396 units was prepared for detailed analysis of NZE strategies using building simulation. The impact of various interventions was evaluated across cities in five climate zones in Australia and a guideline for solution sets that can deliver the goal for each climate zone is presented. The findings show that NZE performance for high-rise residential buildings can be realised in Australia, albeit with some limitations. While the tropical, subtropical and cold temperate climates appear to be more challenging, proper design and optimisation of the envelope proved to be effective in overcoming the challenges imposed by the more demanding climates. The impacts of shading from neighbouring buildings and objects presented the largest impediment to energy production through the faÃ§ade."

"Ventilation performance of a naturally ventilated double-skin façade in buildings Hot Temperature; Blinds; Natural Ventilation Using a double-skin facade for natural ventilation is not a new idea, but the behind mechanism and impacts of those environmental and designing factors on its performance are still unknown and critically needed. Therefore, through this study, the influences of the faÃ§ade and room configurations, together with the environmental factor on buoyant-driven natural ventilation, are addressed. An experimentally validated numerical model has been adopted to analyse the airflow characteristics inside the NVDSF and the room caused by combined radiation and natural convection. Results reveal that the primary influence comes from the dimensions of NVDSF, followed by the size of window openings. For the analysed NVDSF, an optimal gap depth is found at 0.2 m, and an optimal vent height is around 0.2â€“0.3 m. More gap depths result in more counterflows at the top, while a taller vent unnecessarily weakens the heat transfer. Besides, influences from room/window configurations also cannot be overlooked. Windows on the sidewall are found to deliver better indoor airflow coverage, although it gives around 2.5% less ventilation rate. Compared to a â€˜no roomâ€™ condition (i.e., all the openings of the NVDSF are directly connected with outdoor but not room), our models with room only achieved 85â€“93% of the airflow rate depending on window sizes. It highlights the importance of considering room and windows for an accurate and practical assessment. Although the window locations and room dimensions draw minor impacts on the ventilation rates, the changes in airflow distribution prove their own importance in terms of air quality assessment."

"Addressing health and equity in residential low carbon transitions – Insights from a pragmatic retrofit evaluation in Australia Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Health and equity present obligations and currently under-realised opportunities in low carbon transitions. Energy efficiency improvements of homes may benefit health and access to affordable energy, yet better knowledge about contextual mechanisms and household practices is needed for the development of effective programs. This paper presents a mixed methods evaluation of a quasi-randomised controlled retrofit trial targeting low-income older householders. Socio-technical systems thinking offered a useful approach to explore the construct of the engineering-dominated concept of residential energy efficiency in combination with the people-focused experience of housing and health. The study combined a phenomenological enquiry into householder practices with quantitative analyses to explain health, energy cost, temperature and psycho-social outcomes for winter. The findings showed that small retrofits may mitigate the growing energy demands of this ageing population group, provide better comfort and reduce energy costs, but that the effectiveness of the retrofits was reduced by socially shared heating and ventilation practices that contradicted engineering assumptions, the physiological capabilities of the householder and the modes of energy bill payments. A program that is framed around caring and safety and combines retrofits, tariff optimisations and householder practices could provide equitable climate change mitigation outcomes and co-benefits for health for this population group. The paper concludes with implications for the integration of equity and health as goals into low carbon transitions."
"Is transport poverty socially or environmentally driven? Comparing the travel behaviours of two low-income populations living in central and peripheral locations in the same city Public Transport; Accessibility; Transit The paper presents a study to explore the relationship between travel poverty and social disadvantage at the local geographical level. The main aim of the research was to identify the extent to which the revealed travel behavioural outcomes of the study participants are due to personal social constraints or environmental conditions in their residential locations. Specifically, we sought to identify if the greater access to local amenities and public transport services of inner city residents led to an increase in their daily travel activities when compared with their urban peripheral counterparts. The research analysed data from a personal travel survey and one-day travel diary with 502 adults aged between 16 and 65 years in two different deprived areas in Merseyside, North West England. Our analysis is somewhat hampered by the small sample size, but the modelled results suggest that more trips, and longer journey distances do not necessarily imply greater social inclusion. The geographically weighted regression models (GWR) highlighted that the physical location of where people live within the city is more influential on their trip-making patterns than social determinants such as household income, age, gender, and/or employment status. Street connectivity, the level of bus services and neighbourhood safety were all particularly significant for determining spatial variations in the daily trips that were undertaken, with more trips being undertaken where there was a greater density of street nodes, bus stops and where people felt safer at night. This highlights the need for local transport and urban policymakers to carefully consider and target these micro-scale factors when attempting to introduce transport interventions to reduce social exclusion amongst low-income urban populations."
"Understanding the fragmentation of microplastics into nano-plastics and removal of nano/microplastics from wastewater using membrane, air flotation and nano-ferrofluid processes Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Nano/microplastics (NPs/MPs), a tiny particle of plastic pollution, are known as one of the most important environmental threats to marine ecosystems. Wastewater treatment plants can act as entrance routes for NPs/MPs to the aquatic environment as they breakdown of larger fragments of the plastic component during the treatment process; therefore, it is necessary to remove NPs/MPs during the wastewater treatment process. In this study, understanding the effect of water shear force on the fragmentation of larger size MPs into smaller MPs and NPs and their removal by air flotation and nano-ferrofluid (i.e., magnetite and cobalt ferrite particle as a coagulant) and membrane processes were investigated as a proof-of-concept study. It is found that a two-blade mechanical impeller could fragment MPs from 75, 150 and 300 Î¼m into mean size NPs/MPs of 0.74, 1.14 and 1.88 Î¼m, respectively. Results showed that the maximum removal efficiency of polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and polyester was 85, 82 and 69%, respectively, in the air flotation process. Increasing the dose of behentrimonium chloride surfactant from 2 to 10 mg/L improved the efficiency of the air flotation process for NPs/MPs removal. It is also found that the removal efficiency of NPs/MPs by the air flotation system depends on solution pH, size, and types of NPs/MPs. This study also found a less significant removal efficiency of NPs/MPs by both types of ferrofluid used in this study with an average removal of 43% for magnetite and 55% for cobalt ferrite. All three plastics tested had similar removal efficiency by the nano-ferrofluid particles, meaning that this removal technique does not rely on the plastic component type. Among all the process tested, both ultrafiltration and microfiltration membrane processes were highly effective, removing more than 90% of NPs/MPs fragment particles. Overall, this study has confirmed the effectiveness of using air flotation and the membrane process to remove NPs/MPs from wastewater."

"Solar Reforming of Plastic using Ligand-Free Gold Nanoparticles Plastics have found broad application in society due to their versatile properties and low cost, but their use has created a disposal challenge. Eight million tons of plastic enter the oceans every year, and marine plastic pollution is predicted to outweigh the fish in the oceans by 2050. Although recycling is increasingly prevalent, a third of all plastic is still too small or complex to recover economically. A potential solution is to use plastic waste as a feedstock for solar fuel generation.  Recently, Dr Moritz Kuehnel demonstrated the generation of hydrogen from plastic feedstocks using sunlight. Semiconductor nanomaterials, known as quantum dots, were used to harness solar energy to photoreform common plastics. Although a promising `green? technology, the biotoxicity of cadmium and the harsh operating conditions limits the large-scale application of this method.
Gold nanoparticles represent another nanomaterial that can direct light energy toward catalytic processes, in addition to being bio-compatible. However, gold nanoparticles have molecules bound to their surfaces, known as ligands, which stabilise them, preventing the nanoparticles from aggregating and degrading their nanoscale properties. Ligand molecules present a physical barrier to plastic molecules accessing the surface of nanoparticles which hinders the nanoparticles? ability to catalyse the conversion of plastic into solar fuels. Dr Steven Barrow is currently pioneering a novel method of synthesising gold nanoparticles in the absence of ligand molecules. Dr Barrow has shown that these `ligand-free? nanoparticles demonstrate unique interactions with organic molecules and has shown that they can catalyse reactions that are inaccessible to their ligand-stabilised counterparts. This highlights their potential in the photoreforming of plastic, an application for which gold nanoparticles have yet to be utilised.

"Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8 Gender Dysphoria; Transgender Persons; Transsexualism Background: Transgender healthcare is a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field. In the last decade, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number and visibility of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people seeking support and gender-affirming medical treatment in parallel with a significant rise in the scientific literature in this area. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) is an international, multidisciplinary, professional association whose mission is to promote evidence-based care, education, research, public policy, and respect in transgender health. One of the main functions of WPATH is to promote the highest standards of health care for TGD people through the Standards of Care (SOC). The SOC was initially developed in 1979 and the last version (SOC-7) was published in 2012. In view of the increasing scientific evidence, WPATH commissioned a new version of the Standards of Care, the SOC-8. Aim: The overall goal of SOC-8 is to provide health care professionals (HCPs) with clinical guidance to assist TGD people in accessing safe and effective pathways to achieving lasting personal comfort with their gendered selves with the aim of optimizing their overall physical health, psychological well-being, and self-fulfillment. Methods: The SOC-8 is based on the best available science and expert professional consensus in transgender health. International professionals and stakeholders were selected to serve on the SOC-8 committee. Recommendation statements were developed based on data derived from independent systematic literature reviews, where available, background reviews and expert opinions. Grading of recommendations was based on the available evidence supporting interventions, a discussion of risks and harms, as well as the feasibility and acceptability within different contexts and country settings. Results: A total of 18 chapters were developed as part of the SOC-8. They contain recommendations for health care professionals who provide care and treatment for TGD people. Each of the recommendations is followed by explanatory text with relevant references. General areas related to transgender health are covered in the chapters Terminology, Global Applicability, Population Estimates, and Education. The chapters developed for the diverse population of TGD people include Assessment of Adults, Adolescents, Children, Nonbinary, Eunuchs, and Intersex Individuals, and people living in Institutional Environments. Finally, the chapters related to gender-affirming treatment are Hormone Therapy, Surgery and Postoperative Care, Voice and Communication, Primary Care, Reproductive Health, Sexual Health, and Mental Health. Conclusions: The SOC-8 guidelines are intended to be flexible to meet the diverse health care needs of TGD people globally. While adaptable, they offer standards for promoting optimal health care and guidance for the treatment of people experiencing gender incongruence. As in all previous versions of the SOC, the criteria set forth in this document for gender-affirming medical interventions are clinical guidelines; individual health care professionals and programs may modify these in consultation with the TGD person."

"Si: Survivability under overheating: The impact of regional and global climate change on the vulnerable and low-income population Heat Wave; Climate Change; Distributed Lag The present special issue discusses three significant challenges of the built environment, namely regional and global climate change, vulnerability, and survivability under the changing climate. Synergies between local climate change, energy consumption of buildings and energy poverty, and health risks highlight the necessity to develop mitigation strategies to counterbalance overheating impacts. The studies presented here assess the underlying issues related to urban overheating. Further, the impacts of temperature extremes on the low-income population and increased morbidity and mortality have been discussed. The increasing intensity, duration, and frequency of heatwaves due to human-caused climate change is shown to affect underserved populations. Thus, housing policies on resident exposure to intra-urban heat have been assessed. Finally, opportunities to mitigate urban overheating have been proposed and discussed."
"The macroeconomy and microfinance outreach: a panel data analysis Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion This study examines the effects of macroeconomic and institutional factors on microfinance institution (MFI) outreach. To capture the performance of the macroeconomy, we include proxies for institutional quality, economic growth, FDI inflow, unemployment rate, inflation and the prevalence of wage-earning jobs. Further, we examine effects on outreach along the dimensions of outreach depth and outreach breadth. Using data on 1526 MFIs from 99 countries over the period 2000 to 2015, our results suggest that environments characterised by high levels of economic performance and good institutions tend to hinder outreach performance. These results suggest that MFIs depend on a poor economy to thrive given the informal nature of microfinance."

"Topic Enhanced Multi-head Co-Attention: Generating Distractors for Reading Comprehension Automatic; Declarative Sentences; Distractor In the construction of multiple-choice Machine Reading Comprehension(MRC), in addition to questions and answers, it is necessary to generate distractors corresponding to them. Recent models based on Seq2Seq have shown good results in text generation, while previous work has only succeeded in producing a few interfering words or phrases per question. Our goal is to generate more meaningful distractors based on reading comprehension of articles that are closer to the semantics of the question to help better diagnose gaps in text understanding. A major drawback of recent studies is that they do not take the relationship between the distractors and background text into account when generating distractors. This often results in the distractors being either too general or too close to the correct answer. We propose a Topic Enhanced Multi-head Co-Attention model (TMCA) based on hierarchical networks to better capture the interactions between sentences. By adding query-relevance loss, our model enables the distractors to be as semantically relevant to the question as possible based on the reading comprehension of the article, while trying to ensure that they are false answers. The results show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance over the baselines in terms of automatic metrics on two multiple-choice datasets (RACE and DREAM). For further evaluation, we use another advanced reading comprehension model and human evaluation to demonstrate that our model outperforms several strong baselines in generating high-quality and educationally meaningful distracters."

"A parsimonious approach to mapping climate-change-related composite disaster risk at the local scale in coastal Bangladesh Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Climate-change-induced disaster risks impede sustainable development goals in many developing countries. With the prevailing climate change conditions, environmental events are likely to become even more pervasive. Coastal regions, the source of numerous tangible and intangible benefits for human populations, are exposed to a wide range of risks. With the motivation that knowledge of risk at local levels could bring substantial benefits for risk reduction planning, the current study devised a framework for mapping composite disaster risk at the local scale using context-specific risk variables and tested it within a clearly defined coastal sub-district of southwestern Bangladesh. Utilizing easily accessible spatial and non-spatial secondary datasets, a risk map for the study area was formulated using geospatial techniques. The map revealed that within a small area of about 230 km2, the disaster risk varied considerably, which is attributable to the variability of geographic and socio-demographic features of the area. The map delineated 21% of the study area as very high risk, 20% as high, 21% as moderate, 20% as low, and 18% as very low risk. The technique for risk mapping adopted in this study is inexpensive to conduct, doable within a brief period, requires limited data inputs and is thus useable for countries like Bangladesh that have a dearth of data. The resulting map is an improvement over existing risk maps, which are currently available only at the regional scale, and hence provides a robust platform upon which to commence the process of disaster risk reduction in the area."

"Mapping land cover change over a 25-year period (1993-2018) in Sri Lanka using landsat time-series Landsat; Land Cover; Remote Sensing Land use and land cover change (LULCC) are dynamic over time and space due to human and biophysical factors. Accurate and up-to-date LULCC information is a mandatory part of environmental change analysis and natural resource management. In Sri Lanka, there is a significant temporal gap in the existing LULCC information due to the civil war that took place from 1983 to 2009. In order to fill this gap, this study presents a whole-country LULCC map for Sri Lanka over a 25-year period using Landsat time-series imagery from 1993 to 2018. The LandTrendr change detection algorithm, utilising the normalised burn ratio (NBR) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), was used to develop spectral trajectories over this time period. A land cover change and disturbance map was created with random forest, using 2117 manually interpreted reference pixels, of which 75% were used for training and 25% for validation. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 94.14%. The study found that 890,003.52 hectares (ha) (13.5%) of the land has changed, while 72,266.31 ha (1%) was disturbed (but not permanently changed) over the last 25 years. LULCC was found to concentrate on two distinct periods (2000 to 2004 and 2010 to 2018) when social and economic stability allowed greater land clearing and investment opportunities. In addition, LULCC was found to impact forest reserves and protected areas. This new set of Sri Lanka-wide land cover information describing change and disturbance may provide a reference point for policy makers and other stakeholders to aid in decision making and for planning purposes."
"An investigation on simultaneous freshwater production and CO2 capture using flue gas of a power plant Amine; 2-Amino-2-Methyl-1-Propanol; Reboilers This paper presents an investigation on simultaneous freshwater production and CO2 capture using the flue gases of a 500 MWe coal-fired power plant. Generally, a fan/cooler is used to reduce the temperature of flue gas before flowing into the absorber column of a CO2 capture unit. It has been replaced with a heat exchanger in this study. Seawater and flue gas were passed through the heat exchanger to raise the temperature of seawater and reduce the temperature of flue gas. The high-temperature seawater was subsequently fed into a membrane distillation (MD) unit for freshwater production. The cold flue gas was directed to the CO2 capture unit. The heat exchanger and CO2 capture unit were modeled with Aspen Plus software. Whereas MATLAB software was used to develop and solve the MD mathematical model software for freshwater production. The seawater flow rate was varied from 4000 L/min to 7000 L/min in the heat exchanger. As a result, the flue gas (flow rate 781.6 t/h) and the outlet seawater temperatures were reduced from 27.498 to 22.360Â°C and 73.384 to 52.670Â°C, respectively. However, higher inlet seawater temperature in the MD unit produced more freshwater. An increase in inlet seawater feed temperature in the MD unit from 52.670 to 73.384Â°C increased the freshwater production from 211,956.5 to 299,244 L/day. Furthermore, the CO2 capture process has been analyzed by varying the methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and piperazine (PZ) concentrations in weight% (45 and 5, 40 and 10, 35 and 15, and 30 and 20, respectively). It was observed that the energy requirement reduced from 3.55 to 3.26 MJ/kg CO2 by increasing the PZ content from 5 to 20 wt.%. At 15 and 20 wt.% of PZ content in the blended solution of MDEA/PZ, the energy required to regenerate the solvent was 3.31 and 3.26 MJ/kg CO2, respectively. PZ emissions from the absorber were also increased with the raising of PZ content in the blended solution. The energy requirement was not much higher at 15 wt.% than 20 wt.%. Therefore, MDEA/PZ solution (15/35 wt.%) was considered an optimal concentration. The reboiler duty was reduced up to 3.25 MJ/kg CO2 at 15/35 wt.% concentration with stripper pressure of 2.3 bar.

"Exploring the many housing elasticities of supply: The case of Australia House Prices; Housing Market; China The housing elasticity of supply (HES)â€”how housing supply responds to price risesâ€”has been a major preoccupation of policymakers in the face of worsening housing affordability in many countries. Yet we lack an understanding of just how this quantity varies across regions, and within cities, or the factors which drive it. We address this question by estimating the HES for 341 spatially disaggregated Australian local government areas (LGAs) from 2001 to 2019 for houses and units (attached homes). Our estimates document considerable variation in HES estimates across LGAs. For houses it ranges from 0.17 at the 25th percentile to 0.44 at the 75th percentile while for units it varies between 0.56 and 1.17. Interestingly, we find no correlation between the LGA HES estimates for houses and units. We explore how variation in the local HES relates to potential housing supply drivers such as accessibility to central business districts, topography, temperature range, annual precipitation, and political orientation. The most important driver of the HES is accessibilityâ€”LGAs on the city-fringe have the highest HES for houses, while for units it is highest in the inner-city. We find political orientation and annual precipitation have some impact on the HES for units."
"Catalytic selective ring opening of polyaromatics for cleaner transportation fuels Decalin; Methylcyclopentane; Hydrogenation The selective C-C bond cleavage of mono- and bicyclic naphthenic molecules via catalytic ring opening plays a vital role in refining low-quality fossil oils and pyrolysis oils derived from municipal solid waste or waste biomass and tyres. Diesel fuels derived from such oils exhibit high polyaromatic content and low cetane number (CN), resulting in significant particulate emissions upon (inefficient) combustion. Catalytic upgrading of these oils via ring opening to form paraffinic molecules enhances their CN, producing cleaner burning fuels, with reduced particulate and sulfur emissions. Supported transition metal catalysts are attractive candidates for obtaining high-quality fuels by selective C-C bond cleavage of naphthenic molecules with high conversion. Ring opening of model polyaromatics can proceed through several reaction pathways, dictated by the catalyst, feedstock and reaction conditions, producing hydrocarbons with the desired CN. Identification of the active sites in supported transition metal nanoparticles responsible for different ring opening pathways is essential for the development of next-generation catalysts exhibiting higher selectivity and stability. Here, we critically review recent advances in the selective ring opening (SRO) of naphthenic molecules to paraffinic hydrocarbons (with high CN and low aromaticity), and discuss the impact of catalyst design on performance and reaction mechanism. Technical challenges in designing transition metal catalysts for SRO are discussed, and avenues explored for improving diesel fuel quality from low-grade feedstocks, including municipal solid waste."
"Working with ‘illiberal’ sources of peace and order: Talking about human rights Melanesia; Vanuatu; Papua New Guinea Lack of human rights observance and accountability are often put forward by donor agencies as key reasons for not engaging positively with societal sources of order, security and justice in post-colonial states. Discussing issues of gender violence in Vanuatu in particular, this chapter argues for a dialogic approach to engaging across significant differences of power and culture on questions of the systemic imposition of suffering. The chapter argues that this is both a more productive way of working against abuse, but may also be fundamental to understanding and working with human rights. This approach encourages a subtle but significant shift to more relational, dynamic approaches to understanding and promoting human rights."

"Labor market regulation under self-enforcing contracts Unemployment Insurance; Labour Market; Job Search This paper examines the effects of various labor market institutions (policies) on the welfare of workers and employers. We consider self-enforcing contracts between risk-averse workers and risk-neutral employers in a labor market with search frictions. Employers promise to smooth out shocks to wages while workers promise long-term commitment to employers. In this environment, regulatory policies can make it easier or harder for employers to keep their promise of wage smoothing, thus influencing the benefit accruing to each party. In our approach, we analyze the joint effect of policies by distinguishing between the financing and spending of funds used in the regulation of the labor market. With regard to financing, layoff tax strictly dominates hiring and payroll taxes on efficiency grounds, whereas the relative ranking of hiring and payroll taxes depend on the type of equilibrium that realizes. On the spending side, while unemployment payment increases workers' welfare at the expense of employers, in-work benefit in the form of a one-off wage subsidy leaves workers' welfare intact but may increase the welfare of employers."

"Proposing a Real-Time Ticket Monitoring System for Public Transport in NSW, Australia Global System For Mobile Communications; Theft; Internet Of Things The public transport system of New South Wales (NSW), Australia is impotent to receive 100% of the fare from light rail and buses due to the unavailability of a continuous real-time monitoring system. This scheme thereby seeks to help update the NSW public transport ticket collection system, with the aid of a counter that will be integrated into the public transportation within the Ticket Tapping Machine, to provide passenger count against the number of touches occurring at each stop; and thus, increasing the revenue. The product comprises of hardware and software components-the hardware system is located within the public transport while the software system incorporating a web portal is positioned for the authorities to have access to the real-time passenger data. At the hardware end, the ultrasonic sensors and the raspberry pi would detect the number of passengers on the transport and the LCD screen would display the number of passengers who had not tapped their smart card ticket. Additionally, the raspberry pi module used in the hardware component can denote the transportation location with the help of an in-built Wi-Fi component. With this designed technology, the authorities would be able to monitor and record the movements of the passenger in real-time system addressing the existing challenges faced by the NSW public transport authority, especially in the case of light rail and buses being used for free by certain passengers."

"FINANCIAL CONTAGION DURING GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS AND COVID–19 PANDEMIC: THE EVIDENCE FROM DCC–GARCH MODEL Volatility Spillover; Spillover; Comovement This paper is the first study to examine the financial contagion from the U.S., Japanese and Chinese markets to Asian markets during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and Covid-19 Pandemic Crisis. We employ the DCC-EGARCH methodology and daily data of stock returns from 2005 to 2021 to estimate the time-varying correlations and the volatilities of stock markets. Our results show that the correlation between the U.S. and Japanese markets with emerging Asian ones is quite high, implying the interdependence between these markets. Furthermore, we find significant contagion effects from the U.S. equity market to markets in both advanced and emerging economies during the GFC. Nonetheless, during the Covid-19 pandemic, only 3 out of 10 Asian emerging markets had experienced the contagion from the U.S. Our findings also suggest that contagion effects are not strongly related to the level of global integration and Asian markets seem to be more affected by the contagion from Japan and China."

"Providing sports venues on mainland China: Implications for promoting leisure-time physical activity and national fitness policies Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) has been well documented as having substantial health benefits. The 2014 Chinese Fitness Survey Report stated that a lack of physical activity (PA) spaces is the most important non-human factor, leading to 10% of leisure-time physical inactivity in people aged 20 and above. We investigated the provision of sports venues in China and discussed the development of sports venues and national fitness policies in the context of promoting LTPA and public health. We analyzed information from Chinaâ€™s most recent sport venue census, the Sixth National Sports Venues Census, conducted in 2013. The number of sports venues increased between 2000 and 2013, with an inflection point around the year 2008. At the end of 2013, there were 12.45 venues for every 10,000 residents, and the per capita area was 1.46 m2 . However, numbers were still small compared with the United States and Japan. The percentages of full-time access, part-time access and membership venues were 51.5%, 14.3% and 34.2% respectively. Only half of sports venues were fully open to the public, meaning that the realized number and area per capita could be even lower. A lack of sports venues forces people who want to engage in PA to occupy other urban spaces that are not planned and designed for PA. Urban parks had 119,750 fitness station facilities (3.32% of the total), and 2366 urban fitness trails (19.24%), with a combined length of 6450 km (32.91%). On average, urban and rural areas had 13.17 and 10.80 venues per 10,000 persons, and 1.83 m2 and 0.97 m2 per capita. The urban-rural gap in sports venues exactly embodies some aspects of the â€œurban-rural dual structureâ€ in Chinaâ€™s society. Measures to promote PA should focus on new and existing sports venues. In the policy making process, Chinese governments need to pay attention to the potential impact of related, external factors such as the gap between the urban and the rural and the potential advantage of indoor venues against summer heat and air pollution."

"Effects of Working from Home on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Associated Energy Costs in Six Australian Cities Personnel; Teleworker; Flexible Working Working from home (WFH) has been imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The adoption of WFH impacts energy use in the residential, commercial, and transportation sectors. Consequently, this affects the greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) and the associated energy costs to workers and employers. This study estimates the effects of WFH on the GHGE and energy-related costs in the residential, commercial, and transportation sectors. A simple linear model was used to estimate the changes in the GHGEs and cost by a typical employee when WFH practice is adopted for 1.5 and 4 days per week. The adoption of WFH reduces the operational GHGE accounted for commercial buildings and transport. However, it increases the operational GHGE accounted for residential buildings, which is a maximum of about 6% and 12%, respectively, for WFH 1.5 and 4 days. The reduction of GHGE from transport is significantly higher than that of residential buildings. The GHGE reductions from the transport sector are about 30% and 80%, respectively, for WFH 1.5 days and 4 days per week. WFH for 1.5 and 4 days per week reduces the national annual GHGE by about 1.21 Mt CO2-e and 5.76 Mt CO2-e, respectively. Further, the annual transportation cost of an employee is reduced by 30% and 80% in each city when the employee WFH for 1.5 and 4 days per week. The outcomes of this study offer a direction to reduce energy consumption and related costs and potential future research avenues on this topic. Further, the findings also help policymakers develop a hybrid work model for the post-COVID-19 pandemic."
"How has the COVID-19 crisis affected Remittances and Labour Supply in ASEAN Economies? Prior to the devestating eﬀect of the COVID-19 crisis, migrant remittances became a major source of external ﬁnancing for many developing nations, including those in the ASEAN region (Ratha, 2019). As lockdowns and shutdowns spread across the world, migrant sectors were disproportionately hit. This has had a devasting eﬀect for migrant communities and has resulted in a signiﬁcant decline in remittances going to developing countries (Sayeh and Chami, 2020). While remittances are understood to lead to improvements in health, education, inequality and poverty (World Bank 2006; Giuliano and Ruiz-Arranz 2009; Acosta et al. 2007), their eﬀect on labour supply is ambiguous. On the one hand, lower remittances can decrease reservation wages, which increases labour supply. On the other, fewer remittances can lower investment opportunities, leading to lower labour supply. This topic has received some attention in the extant literature using both household and country-level data. The ﬁndings from those studies are inconclusive (Posso 2012; Acosta 2006; Funkhouser 1992; Rodriguez and Tiongson 2001; Jadotte 2009; Cox-Edwards and Rodriguez-Oreggia 2009; Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo 2006; Airola 2008; Hanson 2007)."

"AVOIDING THE WHOLESALE DE-BANKING OF CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGES IN AUSTRALIA Anti-Money Laundering; Crime; Financial Crimes De-banking is the closure of banking facilities by a bank for reasons such as a risk of money laundering. De-banking the Australian Cryptocurrency Exchange (â€˜Crypto Exchangeâ€™) industry could mean that Australian banks fall foul of competition law. In 2021, an Australian Senate inquiry investigated how to regulate cryptocurrencies, including considering de-banking. This article outlines a possible system that reduces the risk to banks of providing banking services to the Australian Crypto Exchange industry. Regulators should continue to adopt a collaborative market governance approach, working with cryptocurrency financial technologies to survey Crypto Exchange operating models. Then they should create an operating model licensing regime and updated Crypto Exchange-specific anti-money laundering (â€˜AMLâ€™) compliance frameworks. That regime would differentiate both centralised and decentralised; and custodian and non-custodian Crypto Exchanges, streamlining this licensing regime for banks. An AML-compliant self-certification system for Crypto Exchanges unable to be licensed is another suggestion. On 20 October 2021, the final Senate Inquiry Report also recommended a similar licensing regime."

"Situation calculus for controller synthesis in manufacturing systems with first-order state representation Event Calculus; Logic Programming; Answer Set Programming Manufacturing is transitioning from a mass production model to a service model in which facilities â€˜bidâ€™ to produce products. To decide whether to bid for a complex, previously unseen product, a facility must be able to synthesize, on the fly, a process plan controller that delegates abstract manufacturing tasks in a supplied process recipe to the available manufacturing resources. Often manufacturing processes depend on the data and objects (parts) they produce and consume. To formalize this aspect we need to adopt a first-order representation of the state of the processes. First-order representations of the state are commonly considered in reasoning about action in AI, and here we show that we can leverage the wide literature on the Situation Calculus and ConGolog programs to formalize this kind of manufacturing. With such a formalization available, we investigate how to synthesize process plan controllers in this first-order state setting. We also identify two important decidable casesâ€”finite domains and bounded action theoriesâ€”for which we provide techniques to actually synthesize the controller."

"A water-based pressure casting method for transtibial prosthetic socket fit in developing countries Amputation; Lower Extremity; Prosthetic Fitting Many challenges are faced by large numbers of people with lower limb amputation in developing countries. Foremost are cost and access to skilled prosthetic services. Attempts have been made to develop socket fabrication techniques that require little or no prosthetic skill. This study investigated a water pressure casting technique (PCAST) to fabricate and fit transtibial (TT) prosthetic sockets. Ethics approval and informed consent were obtained. Fifty-three adults with unilateral TT amputation were recruited from VIETCOT (Hanoi). VIETCOT staff with ISPO category II qualifications fabricated and fitted the prostheses. Firstly, a cotton sock was placed over the residual limb followed by a plaster wrap. The participant stood with the intact limb on a weight-scale and placed the residual limb into a plastic bag-type diaphragm housed in a cylindrical tank filled with water until they stood normally with half body weight supported. Upon hardening a positive plaster model was made and a socket fabricated with a distal pelite cap. A polypropylene socket was then moulded and attached to ICRC prosthetic components and a rubber foot. The same person fabricated, fitted and aligned the prosthesis. Once a participant indicated satisfaction, the following tasks were completed: timed up-and-go (TUG), six-minute walk (6MWT), walking (GAITRite mat) and satisfaction questionnaire (SATPRO). These tasks were also completed after an extended usage period (146 Â± 28 days). Thirty-one of the participants were successfully fitted: fourteen fits failed, eight failed to return, withdrew or became deceased. SATPRO (n = 31) showed high levels of satisfaction (81%) on both test occasions. 6MWT increased by 28 m (p = 0.01) after the usage period. TUG, SATPRO and gait measures remained unchanged. A sub-analysis (n = 21) compared PCAST performance to original socket and prosthesis. No differences were found. In conclusion, the PCAST may assist people with TT amputation in developing countries."

"Possible Recycling Options of Waste Materials in Manufacturing Ceramic Tiles Slag; Waste Glass; Cathode Ray Tubes Throughout the world, the generation of wastes is increasing in quantity and diversity at a rapid rate. Effective and efficient methods must be developed to correctly dispose and recycle the wastes produced. It is also necessary to reduce the non-renewable resources used and lower the impact on our environment. In 2017, over 13.5 million square meters of tiles were produced globally, and the demand for ceramic tiles has escalated along with social development. There has been an increasing incentive to recycle waste materials in ceramic tiles due to the high heterogeneity of the raw materials, and the matrix for creating ceramics being flexibly interchangeable. The objective of this paper is to review and discuss the various recycling options of waste materials in the production of ceramic tiles. Past experimentation includes the addition of glass, coal ash, municipal solid waste ash, sewage sludge, and mining and ore wastes in ceramic tiles. They were used as an additive or substitute for the key components of the ceramic tiles. The results show a general enhancement to the physical and mechanical properties of the tiles with minor adverse effects on the aesthetics. Furthermore, when recycled with toxic wastes, the heavy metals were found to be immobilised during the firing process of the tiles. Therefore, the addition of wastes in tiles offers a sustainable solution to a growing pollution problem, in addition to decreasing the consumption of natural resources utilised in the manufacturing of tiles. However, further research and developments are essential."

"Altering macrophage phenotype for the treatment of chronic airway disease and lung cancer - Administered by LaTrobe University The aim of this proposal is to identify mechanisms through which the Src family kinase Hck promotes innate immune cell-driven, chronic lung
inflammation and lung cancer development. Our preliminary data suggest that excessive Hck activity provides a molecular mechanism to skew macrophage polarization towards an alternatively activated, M2-like phenotype associated with chronic airways disease, and the tumour promoting  microenvironment that we observe in mutant Hck(up) mice. We hypothesize that Hck provides a novel target for therapeutic intervention with chronic airway disease and lung cancer."

"Public satisfaction with urban trees and their management in Australia: The roles of values, beliefs, knowledge, and trust Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure The success of urban forest management strategies is dependent on public support for and engagement with urban trees. Satisfaction with urban trees and their management, and the level of trust people have in urban tree managers, are useful for understanding public opinions. Yet these concepts, and the mechanisms leading to the formation of public opinions remain poorly explored in the literature. Here we explore how satisfaction with urban trees and with urban tree management, and trust in the agencies responsible for urban tree management, are explained by cognitive factors (values, beliefs, and knowledge) and socio-ecological contextual factors (tree presence/canopy cover, cultural diversity, and socioeconomic status) using an online survey of 16 local government areas in south-eastern Australia. Analyses of 2367 responses revealed that people's opinions about trees in general (values and beliefs) were overwhelmingly positive, while their opinions about more contextualised measures such as satisfaction and trust were more mixed. Two distinct pathways that influence satisfaction were identified: one linked to beliefs about having trees in cities, and another one linked to trust in urban tree management. At the local government level, satisfaction was negatively associated with a measure of cultural diversity and very low levels of tree canopy cover, but not with socioeconomic disadvantage. Satisfaction with local trees could be improved by increasing the quality of ecological function of trees, such as habitat provision and tree diversity. Community engagement could also improve satisfaction and trust, particularly perceived procedural fairness of decision-making, reinforce positive beliefs about the outcomes of having trees in cities, and dispel negative beliefs. Engagement processes should recognise that people hold complex and diverse opinions about urban trees, and by incorporating these opinions into decision-making we can meet the increasingly complex and diverse expectations being placed on urban forests."

"“Smart” Discourses, the Limits of Representation, and New Regimes of Spatial Data Smart Cities; Big Data; Internet of Things As â€œsmartâ€ urbanism becomes more influential, spaces and places are increasingly represented through numeric and categorical data that have been gathered by sensors, devices, and people. Such systems purportedly provide access to always visible, measurable, and knowable spaces, facilitating ever more rational management and planning. Smart city spaces are thus governed through the algorithmic administration and categorization of difference and structured through particular discourses of smartness, both of which shape the production of space and place on a local and general level. Valorization of data and its analysis naturalizes constructions of space, place, and individual that elide the political and surveillant forms of technocractic governance on which they are built. This article argues that it is through processes of measurement, calculation, and classification that â€œsmartâ€ emerges along distinct axes of power and knowledge. Using examples drawn from the British Home Officeâ€™s repurposing of charity outreach maps for homeless population deportation and the more recent EU EXIT document checking application for European citizens and family members living in the United Kingdom, we demonstrate the significance of Gunnar Olssonâ€™s thought for understanding the ideological and material power of smartness via his work on the very limits of representation. The discussion further opens a bridge toward a more relational consideration of the construction of space, place, and individual through the thinking of Doreen Massey. Key Words: data, Massey, Olsson, place, smart cities, space, spatial data."

"Simulation scenario analysis of operational day to day storage system of biomass supply chain for a power plant case study based on logistic cost and transportation emissions Biomass; Supply Chain Design; Biomass Power Developing a sustainable transportation network of supplying and delivering a large amount of feedstock to biomass power plants depends on reducing the logistic cost and stable storage system. This study developed a simulation model to assess and help to understand the effect of the storage systems on the total logistic costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in empty fruit bunches (EFB) biomass supply chain (BSC). Our developed model is tested on a power plant industry in the Perak state of Malaysia. To analyze the sensitivity of the storage systems on the total costs and GHG emissions, two storage approaches are selected and compared: on land and satellite storage (SS) systems. This work just focused on operational day to day inventory planning. The results from our real case study showed that SS would outperform on land storage by reducing the GHG emissions from transportation near 50%. However, SS results in a triple increase in total BSC cost. Another finding is that the dedication of truck and train transportation modes is the best cost-effective alternative for transferring the EFB to the ports for the export market. But using the train instead of the barge for short distances would decrease the GHG emissions. Result of this work could be generalized for other BSCs to design a cost-effective and low-pollution transportation network design."

"Marine protected areas ineffectively protect seagrass and coral reef fish communities in the Phu Quoc and An Thoi archipelago, Vietnam Marine Protected Areas; Marine Parks; Environmental Protection The Phu Quoc marine protected area (MPA) is a multiple-use MPA that was established in 2007 and is a component of Vietnamâ€™s National MPA System. The MPA is divided into two spatially separated zones based on habitat type: a seagrass zone and a coral reef zone. In this study, visual census data were collected in 2018â€“2019 and were used to derive fish biomass and community diversity metrics as proxies for ecosystem condition and function (trophic and mobility). The effectiveness of the MPA in protecting fish communities in the seagrass and coral reef zones was evaluated. An updated characterization of the Phu Quoc fish communities, and an assessment of fish community variation among regions and between habitat types, is provided. In total, 125 species representing 74 genera of 40 families were recorded. Omnivores were the most abundant (38%), followed by planktivores (24%), whereas piscivores (2%) were scarce. There was an especially low density of high-value fishery target species such as Haemulidae (<0.01%), Carangidae (<0.2%), Lethrinidae (<0.3%), Lutjanidae (<0.4%), Serranidae (<2%), and Chaetodontidae (<3%). Alarmingly, fishes with a total length of >20 cm only accounted for 1% of the total individuals. Species and functional composition were similar between protected and unprotected areas but differed among regions and between habitats. These results suggest that the protection of fishes provided by Phu Quoc MPA at the time of this study was ineffective. The taxonomic composition of fish communities has remained relatively unchanged over the last approximately 25 years, with the density of large fishes and commercial species remaining low. There is capacity to improve MPA performance by providing adequate resources for threat management and using evidence-based decision-making in management. The 2020 rezoning and expansion of the Phu Quoc MPA is discussed with regards to prioritizing biodiversity and coverage targets."

"Shifting risk to the frontline: case studies in different contract working environments Safety Climate; Accident; Health Management An extensive body of safety literature and research discusses the integral role of rules and procedures in managing workplace hazards, ensuring worker safety, and safeguarding the environment. Nevertheless, organizational accidents and workplace injuries continue to occur, and individual employees often bear the brunt of responsibility. This paper examines how risk becomes shifted to individuals at the bottom of supply chains, focusing on two different groups of contract workers. Specifically, it draws on case studies conducted in Australiaâ€“one on civil contractors working around hazardous infrastructure and one on athletes who are subject to anti-doping requirements. A comparison of the two cases and their distinctive elements illuminates the ways in which structural pressures, organizational dynamics, and context-specific conditions influence the risks shouldered by individuals. Our analysis shows that, in both cases, adverse outcomes are widely seen as the responsibility of contract workers, prompting other actors to judge them as blameworthy. In doing so, risk in various forms (e.g. safety, financial, reputational) becomes shifted onto workers who are constrained by contracts and away from away from higher level actors and organizations that are generally in more powerful positions than frontline workers. This finding suggests that the burden of accountability and potentially liability is borne primarily by frontline workers. Because of this focus, it is easy to lose sight of organizational and structural conditions that contribute to the risks revealed at the individual level. Through an analysis of 57 interviews across both sectors, complemented by participant observations and a media review, this paper underscores the importance of critically considering not only individual worker actions, but also how regulation can support the diversion of risk, responsibility, and liability onto frontline workers."

"Additive Fabrication of Large-Scale Customizable Formwork Using Robotic Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Winding Axial Compression; Polymers; Jackets Based on the established system of concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) tube (CFFT) in civil engineering and construction industry, this research presents a novel fabrication method for freeform FRP formwork through an additive process of winding FRP fabric with industrial robots. Different from the filament winding or fused deposition modeling process in additive manufacture, large-scale formwork is fabricated with layered winding of FRP fabric and simultaneously applying fast cure epoxy resin in the proposed methods. It increases the fabrication speed and material efficiency compared with the typical fabrication process of FRP formworks, and achieved the geometry flexibility from the numerically controlled additive process. The fabrication methods are developed through a series of preliminary tests, exploring the appropriate fabrication parameters, such as the overlapping height of each layer, winding speed, and epoxy resin type. Two additional prototypes addressing geometrical flexibility are also fabricated. Based on the feasibility studies, the article discussed the potential application of this system on a double-skin tubular arch (DSTA) bridge and a tree-like topological optimized column as the future outlook of this method. As developed based on the established construction systems such as CFFTs and DSTAs, not only the proposed system is compatible with current structure and construction system, but it also benefits from combining an off-shelf material with a flexible and accurate programmable robotic process. This research contributes to the scope of additive manufacturing system by targeting the fabrication of nonuniform optimized large-scale structures."
"Cloud-based Disaster Relief Coordination and Optimisation Platform: A Proof of
Concept for Vietnam and Beyond The proposed Proof of Concept (PoC) is of paramount importance given the case of recent voluntary disaster relief operations in the central provinces of Vietnam which were severely affected by several back-to-back floods in early October of 2020. During this operation, there have been various problems widely reported on social media which can be synthesised into (1) too many relief delegations in some affected areas, while too few in the others; (2) too many relief delegations arriving at an affected area at the same time; (3) too many relief necessities which have already been provided at an affected area, while there is a shortage at other areas; and (4) uneven distribution of relief necessities among different groups of affected people. It is envisaged that a lack of up-to-date information, unharmonised coordination among stakeholders involved in the relief operations, and the absence or weak capability in resources optimisation, all contributed to the aforesaid problems. This project, therefore, aims to address the aforesaid problems through the application of
information and computing sciences in disaster relief. Specifically, the PoC of a Cloud-based Disaster Relief Coordination and Optimisation Platform shall be designed and prototyped to (1) enhance the harmonised coordination among various stakeholders in disaster relief operations through centrally processed information and data, and (2) optimise the outcomes of such operations via computing algorithms.

"(Phase 2) Enhancing our Dandenong Creek - Pollution Reduction Program, waterway research and monitoring program of works Ten sites have been established in the Upper Dandenong Creek Catchment to understand the spatial distribution of pollutants and to establish the baseline condition of the area. Sediment from these sites will be sampled in 2018 (usually in spring) and this will be the seventh collection of sediment at these sites, including the initial survey in 2010. The activity within the Pollution Detection program helps us to understand the temporal changes in condition and assess whether pollution mitigation measures implemented over the project are reducing the pollution load to Dandenong Creek.  Additionally it enables us to see if there are any emerging chemicals that need to be monitored in future. Furthermore, results from this survey inform us about priority chemicals within the Creek and from this we can identify sub-catchments for further investigation into pollution sourcing and subsequently pollution prevention.

"Assessment of the Actual and Potential Contributions of Smart City Projects to Climate Resilience in Selected Asia-Pacific Cities Smart city initiatives enabled by Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are deemed essential for helping cities to develop transformative solutions to address the challenges of global change and to create just, sustainable, and resilient communities. Several countries in the AsiaPacific region (e.g., Japan, Taiwan, China, Australia, and India) are at the forefront of designing/implementing smart city projects. While a vast body of knowledge exists on the contributions of such projects to sustainability and quality of life, little is known about their contributions to climate resilience and climate action planning. As many cities in the region are exposed to a broad array of climate-related disasters, enhancing resilience is expected to be at the center of smart city development efforts. Accordingly, the main aim of the proposed project is to investigate the contributions of selected smart city projects to climate resilience. Through inter- and
trans- disciplinary methods and workshops that involve a wide range of stakeholders, we will develop a smart city resilience assessment toolkit and use it to examine actual and/or potential performance of selected cases in Australia, China, Taiwan, India, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, and the United States. Results will provide useful scientific and policy knowledge on how to integrate resilience thinking into smart city developments and will also highlight lessons that can be transferred to less developed countries.

"Female stereotyping and gender socialization through proverbs and idioms: A comparative study of Malaysia and Korea Gender Representation; Textbooks; Picture Books Despite rapid economic growth and social development, women in both Malaysian and Korean societies are still left behind in terms of their social, economic, and political positions compared to women in other countries of equivalent economic standing. In order to better understand the prevalence of gender inequality in both countries, this study, in recognizing the commonly accepted link between gender inequality and religious and socio-cultural context, emphasizes the significance of proverbs as a socializing agent that reflects and reproduces traditional norms and values that perpetuate female stereotypes. In both Malay and Korean societies, proverbs play an important role in upholding important social and cultural values, beliefs, and attitudes through which children learn gender-appropriate behaviors, accept gender assumptions and perspectives, and acquire gender-specific characteristics deeply rooted in the traditions of the society. By examining the depiction of the universal theme of the social role and behavior of women in proverbs, this study compares similarities and differences in the illustrations of women in both Malay and Korean proverbs. In doing so, it aims to analyze how gender stereotypes are created and reinforced through the process of socialization as it takes place within everyday language. Findings will extend our understanding of the relationship between female stereotypes and gender gaps in society and offer greater insight into the interrelationship between language, culture, and gender."

"Do economic openness and institutional quality influence patents? Evidence from GMM systems estimates Intellectual Property Rights; Patent Protection; Patents By using GMM estimators for unbalanced panel data, we examine the effects of institutional quality, trade openness, and FDI flows on innovation in 84 countries for the period between 1996 and 2014. Our results show that, although institutional quality appears as a vital driver for patent applications, FDI flows and trade openness have different influences. Precisely, higher inward FDI flows have a positive effect on the number of patents whereas trade openness might have a negative one. We afterwards discuss the influence of institutional quality on these two effects by showing that the effects of economic openness are enhanced by the improvement of institutional quality. These results are important for policy makers in setting-up the short-run and long-run policies to sustain economic growth."

"Designer Ecosystems for the Anthropocene—Deliberately Creating Novel Ecosystems in Cultural Landscapes Anthropocene; Climate Change; Environment Crisis Accepting that nature and culture are intricately co-evolved has profound implications for the ethical, legal, philosophical and pragmatic dimensions of social and environmental policy. The way we think about nature affects how we understand and manage ecosystems. While the ideals of preserving wilderness and conserving ecosystems have motivated much conservation effort to date, achieving these ideals may not be feasible under Anthropocene conditions unless communities accept custodial responsibilities for landscapes and other species. This paperâ€™s origins are in the authorâ€™s work with the Martuwarra Fitzroy River Council representing Indigenous traditional owners in Australiaâ€™s Kimberley region. These landscapes, shaped by 60,000 years of human occupation, interweave knowledge, laws and governance regimes, and material and spiritual connections with country. This interweaving offers insights into options for dealing with humanityâ€™s complex sustainability challenges. The paper also draws on the literature about cultural landscapes, ecological design, agroecology and permaculture to explore options for applying ecological design as a planning and problem-solving framework. The paper concludes that design-based approaches offer significant opportunities for using ecological science to integrate conservation and production in agricultural landscapes in ways that can meet human needs while also conserving biodiversity under climate change."

"Understanding the contextual influences of the health outcomes of residential energy efficiency interventions: realist review Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Residential energy efficiency interventions are complex social and construction programmes that may benefit health, yet the interactions between the material improvements, health and health-related outcomes, and householder responses are not well understood. While indoor winter warmth and householder satisfaction have been identified as the key mediators for physiological, mental and social health outcomes, this paper explores how programme contexts may have influenced the outcomes. This review revealed that common target populations were low income households, children and the elderly. The review found that peopleâ€™s expectations and culturally constructed heating practices influenced indoor temperatures and householder satisfaction. Very deprived households were still affected by financial constraints despite the intervention measures. Excessive ventilation and limited technical mastery counteracted the beneficial effects of the intervention measures. Poor workmanship and ineffective handover undermined energy consumption objectives and led to householder dissatisfaction. Effective intervention design should address householder needs and the programmeâ€™s sociocultural context."

"A critical review of advanced oxidation processes for emerging trace organic contaminant degradation: Mechanisms, factors, degradation products, and effluent toxicity PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs The persistent nature and low biodegradability of a large number of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) reduce effectiveness of their removal by conventional wastewater treatments. In this context, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as photolysis, photocatalysis, ozonation, Fenton process, anodic oxidation, sonolysis and wet air oxidation, have been studied extensively for the effective degradation of the wide range of TrOCs. All AOPs produce reactive oxygen species (HO2â—, O2â—âˆ’), especially hydroxyl radicals that unselectively attack contaminants and oxidise them. Factors affecting the degradation rates of TrOCs by different AOPs include the concentration and nature of the TrOCs, bulk wastewater characteristics, dose of chemicals or catalysts used, and other reaction parameters. This review critically analyses the overview of already established AOPs, the effect of the structure of TrOCs based on different functional groups such as electron donating groups (EDGs) and electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) on their degradation by each AOP. The overall degradation rates based on data collected from a comprehensive literature review show that ozonation achieves effective degradation for a broad range of TrOCs, but it can lead to the production of toxic degradation by-products. By comparison, photocatalysis shows moderate to high degradation rate for TrOCs. Photolysis and Fenton processes show TrOC-specific suitability. This review also demonstrates that optimum doses of chemicals/catalysts are required for each AOP. This is because excessive concentrations of catalysts or other chemicals (e.g., H2O2: iron dose in Fenton process) may result in low TrOC degradation. Degradation of individual TrOCs can result in a number of degradation by-product that varies in nature. Different AOP has different reaction mechanisms that also affect the number and nature of by-product formation during TrOC degradation."

"Values and cognitive mechanisms: Comparing the predictive factors of Australian meat intake Vegetarians; Vegan Diet; Meat Recent studies have found values for animal-welfare, personal-health and the environment to be the main factors motivating veg*n diets. However, studies are yet to simultaneously compare these values between Australian meat-eaters, vegetarians, and vegans, and therefore, the extent to which they motivate these groups. Further, while cognitive mechanisms (methods of reducing the psychological discomfort of eating meat while holding such values) have been found to facilitate meat intake, these mechanisms are yet to be compared against values in their ability to predict meat consumption. In the current study, meat-eaters reported the lowest concern for animal-welfare, personal-health, and the environment. With the exception of personal-health, vegans reported the greatest concern for these factors. However, cognitive mechanisms predicted meat consumption more strongly than these values. These findings may have implications for reducing meat consumption and improving outcomes for animal-welfare, public health and the environment."

"Hem Realities: Augmenting Urbanism Through Tacit and Immersive Feedback Vietnam; Wildcat Strike; Urbanization This paper investigates a gap in the relationship between the physical city and current â€œsmart cityâ€ solutions in the context of rapidly developing urban regions. In particular it reconsiders these two â€œrealitiesâ€: the material, spatial and social qualities of cities, and the immersive qualities of hybrid digital interfaces such as augmented and virtual reality. With regard to both analog and digital realms, our research proposes an inclusive and participatory approach to the design and implementation of smart city technologies. Using Ho Chi Minh City (or HCMC) as a case study, it explores how a cityâ€™s tacit feedback, combined with mixed reality tools, can expand public accessibility of cities, and in particular of high-density districts. Activating the city through its citizens rather than relying on top-down political policies, this form of â€œaugmented urbanismâ€ advocates a community-based approach to transcending the smartness divide. Ho Chi Minh City offers many examples of shared, multifunctional spaces with localized forms of use and administration. However, these are under threat from intense urban development and subsequent environmental impact. This paper will suggest ways in which mixed reality tools could strengthen community engagement in neighborhoods that are marginalized or threatened by ongoing development, and how this process might also inform and bolster governmental support for locally-based initiatives. The research argues for the city itself (material and empirical) to identify, harness and leverage its own inherent forms of â€œsmartnessâ€. Integrating the cityâ€™s tacit knowledge with open-source platforms can ensure that the ongoing transformation of the city is a collective and intelligent one. This is also a way to provide persistent experiences within a radically and rapidly shifting urban environment."

"Osteocyte transcriptome mapping identifies a molecular landscape controlling skeletal homeostasis and susceptibility to skeletal disease AMG 785; Osteocytes; Wnt Signaling Osteocytes are master regulators of the skeleton. We mapped the transcriptome of osteocytes from different skeletal sites, across age and sexes in mice to reveal genes and molecular programs that control this complex cellular-network. We define an osteocyte transcriptome signature of 1239 genes that distinguishes osteocytes from other cells. 77% have no previously known role in the skeleton and are enriched for genes regulating neuronal network formation, suggesting this programme is important in osteocyte communication. We evaluated 19 skeletal parameters in 733 knockout mouse lines and reveal 26 osteocyte transcriptome signature genes that control bone structure and function. We showed osteocyte transcriptome signature genes are enriched for human orthologs that cause monogenic skeletal disorders (P = 2.4 Ã— 10âˆ’22) and are associated with the polygenic diseases osteoporosis (P = 1.8 Ã— 10âˆ’13) and osteoarthritis (P = 1.6 Ã— 10âˆ’7). Thus, we reveal the molecular landscape that regulates osteocyte network formation and function and establish the importance of osteocytes in human skeletal disease."

"P2P Lending platforms in Malaysia: the awareness among young adults Crowdfunding; Lending; Fintech Background - Since 2016, the Securities Commission (SC) in Malaysia has given licenses to only eleven P2P lending platforms. Such lending platforms are expected to disrupt the lending services of traditional lenders in the coming years. However, being still in their infant stages, it is essential to know the extent to which such platforms are made known to potential investors out there. This study examines the extent to which young adults are aware of Malaysia's eleven P2P lending platforms. Methods - A sample of 65 undergraduate students majoring in finance and accounting was used for this pilot study. An online questionnaire was designed with three main parts: demographic, financial literacy, and P2P lending awareness. Results - Findings show that more than half of respondents in the sample are not aware of P2P lending platforms in Malaysia. Most of the respondents are financially literate to certain degrees. Those aware of their presence underestimated the potentially high level of their default rates and misunderstood that investor would be fully protected by such platforms when a loan default. Conclusions -The study's findings have shed light on the current awareness of P2P lending platforms among Malaysian young adults, potential investors of such platforms in the coming years."

"A Generic Framework of Unifying Industrial By-products for Soil Stabilization Soil Cement; Compressive Strength; Calcium Carbide This paper presents a newly proposed generic framework for unifying different industrial by-products (IBPs) as composite binders to potentially replace ordinary Portland cement (OPC) for soft clay stabilization. The concepts of three chemical moduli (TCM) and strength activity index (SAI) are used to determine the fractions of different IBPs, and the final design mix is further tuned by adding gypsum for additional strength gain contributed by density due to ettringite formation. As a case study, a coastal soft clay was stabilized by different IBPs and gypsum using the new generic framework. Results show that the highest unconfined compression strengths of the IBPs stabilized clay cured for 7, 28, and 60 days reach 0.75, 1.21, and 1.39 MPa, respectively, which are even higher than those of the OPC-stabilized counterparts, suggesting the possibility of using IBPs to substitute OPC. Moreover, the additive gypsum plays a beneficial role for more strength gain due to the formation and volumetric expansion of ettringite. The implementation strategy for the new framework is recommended, and its practical implications for soil stabilization are discussed in terms of IBPs recycling and reuse, environmental sustainability, and economic benefits."

"The leadership role of teachers and environment club coordinators in promoting ecocentrism in secondary schools: Teachers as exemplars of environmental education Deep Ecology; Sustainability; Anthropocentric This study of Naessian ecocentrism and anthropocentrism in three environment club coordinators/science teachers, their colleagues and some parents at three secondary schools uses deep ecology and relational fields as primary frameworks for open-ended interviews. The findings reveal new insights into the affective, cognitive and behavioural characteristics of coordinators who enhance environmental education in their schools. The work presents preliminary data on leadership among sustainability coordinators who run environment clubs. It fills a gap in the literature by showing that in addition to environmental educators requiring knowledge and attitudes regarding sustainability practices, affective qualities like connectedness and love for the environment may be important to their success as sustainability exemplars. Teachers emerge as sustainability exemplars in a relational field to implement sustainability across the secondary curriculum, galvanise students, teachers and parents to connect to the Earth, and help students, teachers and parents move away from anthropocentrism. Findings suggest that if schools commit resources and time to the coordinator's role, students experience significant benefits by becoming closer to the Earth and more empowered to act for the environment in ways consistent with deep ecology."

"Coercive control of money, dowry and remittances among Indian migrant women in Australia Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Help-Seeking This paper examines how coercive control underlies financial abuse as men re-interpret the gender of money, stripping it of its moral safeguards. Financial abuse denies women access and agency over money. It works through male reinterpretation of how money is genderedâ€“that is the way men and women own, inherit, use, manage and control money. Recent Indian migrant women experience coercive control when the male control of money is exercised without responsibility for the welfare of the wife and children. The family boundary of money becomes a way of extorting money from the wifeâ€™s family. Sending money home, a sign of filial responsibility, becomes abusive when the wife is not consulted, leaving the family in Australia without sufficient money for their settlement needs. This paper extends the theoretical and geographic breadth of studies of family violence among Indian women in the diaspora."

"A comprehensive study on meltpool depth in laser-based powder bed fusion of Inconel 718 Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) One problematic task in the laser-based powder bed fusion (LB-PBF) process is the estimation of meltpool depth, which is a function of the process parameters and thermophysical properties of the materials. In this research, the effective factors that drive the meltpool depth such as optical penetration depth, angle of incidence, the ratio of laser power to scan speed, surface properties and plasma formation are discussed. The model is useful to estimate the meltpool depth for various manufacturing conditions. A proposed methodology is based on the simulation of a set of process parameters to obtain the variation of meltpool depth and temperature, followed by validation with reference to experimental test data. Numerical simulation of the LB-PBF process was performed using the computational scientific tool â€œFlow3D Version 11.2â€ to obtain the meltpool features. The simulation data was then developed into a predictive analytical model for meltpool depth and temperature based on the thermophysical powder properties and associated parameters. The novelty and contribution of this research are characterising the fundamental governing factors on meltpool depth and developing an analytical model based on process parameters and powder properties. The predictor model helps to accurately estimate the meltpool depth which is important and has to be sufficient to effectively fuse the powder to the build plate or the previously solidified layers ensuring proper bonding quality. Results showed that the developed analytical model has a high accuracy to predict the meltpool depth. The model is useful to rapidly estimate the optimal process window before setting up the manufacturing tasks and can therefore save on lead-time and cost. This methodology is generally applied to Inconel 718 processing and is generalisable for any powder of interest. The discussions identified how the effective physical factors govern the induced heat versus meltpool depth which can affect the bonding and the quality of LB-PBF components."

"An analytical view on STEM education and outcomes: Examples of the social gap and gender disparity in Vietnam Birth Order; Siblings; Only Child United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goal 4, namely Quality Education, has highlighted major challenges for all nations to ensure inclusive and equitable quality access to education, facilities for children and young adults. The SDG4 is even more important for developing nations as receiving proper education or vocational training, especially in science and technology, means a foundational step in improving other aspects of their citizensâ€™ lives. However, the extant scientific literature about STEM education still lacks focus on developing countries, even more in rural areas. Using a dataset of 4967 observations of junior high school students from a rural area in a transition economy, the article employed the Bayesian approach to identify the association between gender, socio-economic status, and studentsâ€™ STEM academic achievements, which were measured by the average score of their most recent 45-minute standard school tests in STEM subjects: Maths, Physics, Chemistry (and Biology where applicable). The results reported that gender had little association with STEM academic achievements. However, female students appeared to have achieved better results than their male counterparts when their parents have non-manual jobs. Families with better economic status, parents with a high level of education, or non-manual jobs were associated with better study results. Also, students with zero or more than two siblings were correlated with lower study results than those with only one sibling. These results provided important implications for policymakers to provide women with opportunities for better education and maintain family size so the parents can provide their resources to each child equally."

"Cost reduction and Deployment of Prefabricated Building Integrated Photovoltaics By 2050, world energy consumption is expected to increase more than 55%. Buildings remain a sector where efficiency improvement is critical to achieving the commitments of the Paris Agreement. Current approaches for the reduction of energy consumption in buildings are often predicated on the integration of bespoke renewable technologies into building projects. Among various renewable energy sources, solar energy is an attractive option in many countries with access to abundant solar resources.
Worldwide growth of photovoltaics has been fitting an exponential curve for more than two decades. Technology development, commercialization, and manufacturing scaling have contributed significantly to rapid reductions in solar hardware costs. However, the 'soft costs' of going solar including design, energy storage, financing, procurement, permitting, installation, labour, and inspection, have not declined as rapidly. The 'soft costs' make up more than half of the total cost of solar systems in buildings. The lack of economic confidence in the building sector makes the integration of prefabricated solar panels to building envelop difficult. 
This research aims to evaluate the mechanisms driving the cost reductions and deployment of prefabricated Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV). We will delve deeply into specific past technological innovations and policies, and prospectively asses BIPV's potential for future cost reduction."

"Is the global public willing to drink recycled water? A review for researchers and practitioners Water Reuse; Reuse; Public Acceptance This study provides practitioners with an overview of previous research on public perceptions of drinking recycled water. Support for potable reuse varies widely across countries, but it is clear that the public is very responsive to context and information. Previous research has made limited use of the fact that (a) wastewater effluent is already present in water supplies across the world, and (b) awareness of this fact can make individuals ten times more likely to highly support potable reuse. Successful projects in Singapore and San Diego provide evidence that well-designed public relations campaigns can effectively manage community concerns."
"Ableism versus free speech in Australia: challenging online hate speech toward people with Down syndrome Hate Crime; Sexual And Gender Minorities; Islamophobia Negative, ableist discourse challenging the rights of people with Down syndrome to receive support services and even to be born regularly arise on social media. This disability community has retaliated against such hate speech with resistance narratives that promote the value of people with Down syndrome, with few other recourses available. This article explores online free speech versus ableism in Australia through a major case study of 60 Minutes Australia Facebook discussions. Analysis identifies types of ableism expressed, types of harm caused and dimensions of grassroots responses. Using Timothy Garton Ashâ€™s 2016 work Free Speech as a basis for contemporary analysis, we discuss: to what extent should harmful and offensive comments directed at vulnerable populations be tolerated in the name of free speech; might negative, ableist discourse contribute to any social good; and what mechanisms beyond grassroots resistance narratives might effectively respond to harmful, online ableist discourses. Points of interest The article looks at whether the right to free speech is more important than the harmful effects of online hate speech towards people with Down syndrome. We use the ideas in a book on Free Speech by Timothy Garton Ash to think about whether online hate speech should be allowed or silenced. Our analysis is based on a case study of Facebook discussion threads from a 60 Minutes Australia television segment. People in the disability community speaking up to create resistance narratives is the main way that online disability hate speech is challenged. Other ways that could help are laws, government agencies providing support materials, and social media rules."
"Regions undergoing transition: the roles of unions and their peakbodies (administered by UTas) The project aims to investigate how workers can shape their futures in sub-national regions. Such futures are informed by the past, a critical dimension. The anticipated goal is to explain how this might happen in beneficial ways to the community and industry. This project expects to generate new knowledge for the generation of policies and plans for regional transition. Expected outcomes include theory development to explain organised labour’s role in mobilising worker voice via both individual unions and regional union bodies, in social and economic transition. This should provide significant benefits such as understanding the limits and possibilities of transition policies as well as empowering regionally located workers."

"Proposing a Real-Time Ticket Monitoring System for Public Transport in NSW, Australia Global System For Mobile Communications; Theft; Internet Of Things The public transport system of New South Wales (NSW), Australia is impotent to receive 100% of the fare from light rail and buses due to the unavailability of a continuous real-time monitoring system. This scheme thereby seeks to help update the NSW public transport ticket collection system, with the aid of a counter that will be integrated into the public transportation within the Ticket Tapping Machine, to provide passenger count against the number of touches occurring at each stop; and thus, increasing the revenue. The product comprises of hardware and software components-the hardware system is located within the public transport while the software system incorporating a web portal is positioned for the authorities to have access to the real-time passenger data. At the hardware end, the ultrasonic sensors and the raspberry pi would detect the number of passengers on the transport and the LCD screen would display the number of passengers who had not tapped their smart card ticket. Additionally, the raspberry pi module used in the hardware component can denote the transportation location with the help of an in-built Wi-Fi component. With this designed technology, the authorities would be able to monitor and record the movements of the passenger in real-time system addressing the existing challenges faced by the NSW public transport authority, especially in the case of light rail and buses being used for free by certain passengers."

"Activist ecologies of study in the learning city: deformalisations of educational life Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work The combined impacts of COVID-19 and global climate change are destabilising the infrastructures and future prospects of formal educational systems, with schools and universities struggling to adapt to conditions of radical precarity. At the same time, activist movements are generating alter-educational platforms that reappropriate the learning infrastructures of cities as mobile architectures of pedagogical resistance. Building on Harney and Motenâ€™s The Undercommons, this paper discusses transnational examples of radical pedagogies that engage the city as an ecology of deformalised study. We highlight examples from Melbourneâ€™s COVID-19 lockdown regime, emphasising how informal study enabled community-led responses to crisis at city-scale. We then turn to urban ecologies of study arising from contemporary activist movements, drawing connections between protest movements in Hong Kong and Deleuze and Guattariâ€™s concept of the â€˜war machineâ€™. This leads to a speculative re-imagining of alternative educational values and futures within a milieu of activist study, care, and resistance."
"A single sensor based multispectral imaging camera using a narrow spectral band color mosaic integrated on the monochrome CMOS image sensor Color Printing; Metals; Counterfeiting A multispectral image camera captures image data within specific wavelength ranges in narrow wavelength bands across the electromagnetic spectrum. Images from a multispectral camera can extract a additional information that the human eye or a normal camera fails to capture and thus may have important applications in precision agriculture, forestry, medicine, and object identification. Conventional multispectral cameras are made up of multiple image sensors each fitted with a narrow passband wavelength filter and optics, which makes them heavy, bulky, power hungry, and very expensive. The multiple optics also create an image co-registration problem. Here, we demonstrate a single sensor based three band multispectral camera using a narrow spectral band red-green-blue color mosaic in a Bayer pattern integrated on a monochrome CMOS sensor. The narrow band color mosaic is made of a hybrid combination of plasmonic color filters and a heterostructured dielectric multilayer. The demonstrated camera technology has reduced cost, weight, size, and power by almost n times (where n is the number of bands) compared to a conventional multispectral camera."
"The global impact of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) on terrestrial biodiversity Swine; Feral; Crop Damage The International Union for the Conservation of Natureâ€™s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species is a comprehensive database of over 120,000 species and is a powerful tool to evaluate the threat of invasive species to global biodiversity. Several problematic species have gained global recognition due to comprehensive threat assessments quantifying the threat these species pose to biodiversity using large datasets like the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, the global threat of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) to biodiversity is still poorly understood despite well-documented ecosystem level impacts. In this study, we utilized the IUCN Red List to quantify the impacts of this globally distributed species throughout its native and non-native range. Here we show that wild pigs threaten 672 taxa in 54 different countries across the globe. Most of these taxa are listed as critically endangered or endangered and 14 species have been driven to extinction as a direct result of impacts from wild pigs. Our results show that threats from wild pigs are pervasive across taxonomic groups and that island endemics and taxa throughout the non-native range of wild pigs are particularly vulnerable."

"Microbiologically influenced corrosion: A review of the studies conducted on buried pipelines Microbial Corrosion; Biofilm; Carbon Steels Buried pipelines are essential for the delivery of potable water around the world. A key cause of leaks and bursts in these pipelines, particularly those fabricated from carbon steel, is the accelerated localized corrosion due to the influence of microbes in soil. Here, studies conducted on soil corrosion of pipelines' external surface both in the field and the laboratory are reviewed with a focus on scientific approaches, particularly the techniques used to determine the action and contribution of microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC). The review encompasses water pipeline studies, as well as oil and gas pipeline studies with similar corrosion mechanisms but significantly higher risks of failure. Significant insight into how MIC progresses in soil has been obtained. However, several limitations to the current breadth of studies are raised. Suggestions based on techniques from other fields of work are made for future research, including the need for a more systematic methodology for such studies."

"Study protocol for the Healthier Wealthier Families (HWF) pilot randomised controlled trial: Testing the feasibility of delivering financial counselling to families with young children who are identified as experiencing financial hardship by community-based nurses Mental Health Care; Primary Care; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Introduction Poverty and deprivation can harm children's future health, learning, economic productivity and societal participation. The Australian Healthier Wealthier Families project seeks to reduce the childhood inequities caused by poverty and deprivation by creating a systematic referral pathway between two free, community-based services: Universal, well-child nursing services, which provide health and development support to families with children from birth to school entry, and financial counselling. By adapting the successful Scottish 'Healthier Wealthier Children' model, the objectives of this Australian pilot are to test the (1) feasibility of systematising the referral pathway, and (2) short-term impacts on household finances, caregiver health, parenting efficacy and financial service use. Methods and analysis This pilot randomised controlled trial will run in three sites across two Australian states (Victoria and New South Wales), recruiting a total of 180 participants. Nurses identify eligible caregivers with a 6-item, study-designed screening survey for financial hardship. Caregivers who report one or more risk factors and consent are randomised. The intervention is financial counselling. The comparator is usual care plus information from a government money advice website. Feasibility will be evaluated using the number/proportion of caregivers who complete screening, consent and research measures, and access financial counselling. Though powered to assess feasibility, impacts will be measured 6 months post-enrolment with qualitative interviews and questionnaires about caregiver-reported income, loans and costs (adapted from national surveys, for example, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey); health (General Health Questionnaire 1, EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale short-form); efficacy (from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children); and financial service use (study-designed) compared between arms. Ethics and dissemination Ethics committees of the Royal Children's Hospital (HREC/57372/RCHM-2019) and South West Sydney Local Health District (2019/ETH13455) have approved the study. Participants and stakeholders will receive results through regular communication channels comprising meetings, presentations and publications."

"Shear–induced anisotropy in granular materials under various saturation states Granular Materials; Sand; Strain Localization This study presents a micromechanical study on the characteristics of shear-induced anisotropy in granular media under various saturation states. A series of unsaturated triaxial compression tests under the full range of degree of saturation are performed by using Discrete Element Method (DEM). The effect of the suctions on the characteristics of anisotropy is illustrated and discussed. Good agreements between anisotropy and stress ratio are observed for saturated and unsaturated states if skeleton contact stress is adopted. With the increase of the suctions, the weight of fabric tensor anisotropy decreases while the weight of anisotropy related to normal forces increases. The mechanical anisotropy plays a dominant role in providing shear resistance for the full saturation range."

"What are the impacts of living in social housing? New evidence from Australia Neighborhood Effects; Public Housing; Poverty In this paper, we apply statistical matching methods to a national longitudinal dataset of Australians facing housing insecurity to estimate the impacts of social housing on employment, education, health, incarceration and homelessness. We find social housing in Australia provides an important `safety netâ€™ protecting people from homelessness. However, at least in the short run, individuals in social housing have similar outcomes in terms of employment, education, physical and mental health, and incarceration to other comparable individuals not in social housing. These are the first estimates of causal impacts of social housing, simultaneously estimating impacts on a range of shelter and non-shelter outcomes highlighted as important by the broader social housing literature. They also provide an interesting contrast with the existing US estimates. These results are potentially due to strict targeting of individuals into social housing and that they represent the average effect across individuals who may experience substantially different impacts."

"Synthesis and optimization of chitosan supported magnetic carbon bio-nanocomposites and bio-oil production by solvothermal carbonization co-precipitation for advanced energy applications Hydrothermal Carbonization; Hydrochars; Carbon Synthesis of hybrid nanomaterials in the lab-scale frequently involves complex processing and often is not able to be adopted in the industry without major enhancements for its commercial production. This research is focused on a convenient route for the fabrication of chitosan-supported magnetically recoverable carbon bio-nanocomposites by functionalizing magnetic nanoparticles on chitosan and renewable carbon material using solvothermal carbonization co-precipitation (STCC). This process can be adopted in large-scale synthesis with minimum enhancements. The nanocomposites produced using STCC offered excellent features including porous and ultrafine nanostructure, stable mechanical, and chemical properties. From the analysis of variance (ANOVA), the temperature has been found to be the most influential factor for both magnetic nanocomposite and bio-oil yield. The highest porosity for nanocomposites was observed with water-based synthesis at 260 Â°C at 194.62 m2/g. However, water/ethanol (50:50) at 260 Â°C yielded 6.67% and 8.01% more bio-oil and having 5.35% and 3.49% higher heating value as compared to that of bio-oil produced using water and ethanol."
"Futuristic methods for determining HIV co-receptor use Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Tropisms; HIV-1 HIV infection of two key immune cells, CD4+ T cells and macrophages, plays a major role in the establishment of HIV infection and the seeding of the latent reservoir. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the determinants of viral tropism for these cell types and the molecular Env-receptor interactions involved. The development of novel futuristic methods including machine learning and neural network approaches, will allow the generation of sophisticated genotypic predication algorithms which will greatly enhance accurate HIV coreceptor usage identification within the clinic. Furthermore, advancements in surface plasmon resonance, biolayer interferometry and glycol-FRET technologies will be fundamental for real time investigation of molecular mechanisms involvement in Env-receptor interactions, which will enhance our understanding of coreceptor usage and viral tropism determinants. These technologies will be important for the development and improvement of therapeutic efficacy, novel entry inhibitors and assist vaccine design."

"Model Validation of a Three-Phase Inverter EMT Model in DIgSILENT Power Factory Inverters; Electric Current Control; Connected Ongoing global efforts to reduce carbon emissions are leading to a technological transformation of electrical grids from fossil fuel energy production using rotating machines, to renewable energy production using power electronic converters. However, conventional power system modelling and simulation approaches (i.e. root-mean-square strategies) are unable to adequately analyse power system dynamics with grid connected inverters. This is because accurate representation of the transient behaviour of a physical inverter system requires a high-resolution detailed time domain inverter simulation model. This paper presents a discrete-time approach to modelling such a grid connected inverter system, which accurately represents its transient response using an electromagnetic transient (EMT) DIgSILENT Power Factory model of a three-phase grid-connected inverter, current regulated in the synchronous reference frame (SRF). The performance of the developed EMT model has been confirmed by comparison against a known, and previously experimentally validated, time domain inverter model developed in PSIM."

"Impact of biological activated carbon pre-treatment on the hydrophilic fraction of effluent organic matter for mitigating fouling in microfiltration Membrane; Ultrafiltration; Chemical Cleaning The hydrophilic (HPI) fraction of effluent organic matter, which has protein and carbohydrate contents, has a high propensity to foul low-pressure membranes. Biological activated carbon (BAC) filtration was examined as a pre-treatment for reducing the fouling of a microfiltration (MF) membrane (0.1 Âµm PVDF) by the HPI organic fraction extracted from a biologically treated secondary effluent (BTSE). Although the BAC removed less dissolved organic carbon, carbohydrate and protein from the HPI fraction than the granular activated carbon treatment which was used for comparison, it led to better improvement in permeate flux. This was shown to be due to the removal/breakdown of the HPI fraction resulting in less deposition of these organics on the membrane, many components of which are high molecular weight biopolymers (such as protein and carbohydrate molecules) through biodegradation and adsorption of those molecules on the biofilm and activated carbon. This study established the potential of BAC pre-treatment for reducing the HPI fouling of the membrane and thus improving the performance for the MF of BTSE for water reclamation."

"Designer Ecosystems for the Anthropocene—Deliberately Creating Novel Ecosystems in Cultural Landscapes Anthropocene; Climate Change; Environment Crisis Accepting that nature and culture are intricately co-evolved has profound implications for the ethical, legal, philosophical and pragmatic dimensions of social and environmental policy. The way we think about nature affects how we understand and manage ecosystems. While the ideals of preserving wilderness and conserving ecosystems have motivated much conservation effort to date, achieving these ideals may not be feasible under Anthropocene conditions unless communities accept custodial responsibilities for landscapes and other species. This paperâ€™s origins are in the authorâ€™s work with the Martuwarra Fitzroy River Council representing Indigenous traditional owners in Australiaâ€™s Kimberley region. These landscapes, shaped by 60,000 years of human occupation, interweave knowledge, laws and governance regimes, and material and spiritual connections with country. This interweaving offers insights into options for dealing with humanityâ€™s complex sustainability challenges. The paper also draws on the literature about cultural landscapes, ecological design, agroecology and permaculture to explore options for applying ecological design as a planning and problem-solving framework. The paper concludes that design-based approaches offer significant opportunities for using ecological science to integrate conservation and production in agricultural landscapes in ways that can meet human needs while also conserving biodiversity under climate change."
"Engineering meets institutions: an interdisciplinary approach to the management of resilience Critical Infrastructure; Resilience; Disaster Resilience management stretches across the decoupled domains of community, corporate, and public governance. As a result, fostering resilience needs a governance structure that supports collective actions and integrates fragmented fields with different institutional frameworks. In this study, we carry out a review of three different perspectives on resilience -engineering, social, and organizational- in order to explore resilience management in the context of governance of infrastructure systems. We discuss the common practices to address resilience of engineering systems, the need and current trend for integration of institutions into these practices through formal (e.g., policies and regulations) as well as informal mechanisms (e.g., trust, norms, and shared cognitive structures). To illustrate our theorizing, we provide three illustrative case studies. The cases highlight the barriers and enablers across the three perspectives and highlight the inter-organizational context of management of resilience. We uncovered organizational dynamics such as the necessity of establishing critical functionality through organizational capacity for stakeholder engagement, the need for diverse organizations to address institutional complexity in management of resilience, and the importance of decoupling in aligning the outcomes of resilience management practices with policies. We suggest an agenda for future research on managing practices associated with management of resilience."

"Navigating the neighbourhood: gender, place and agency in children’s mobility Report Cards; Mode Choice; Built Environment Children have an intrinsic right to urban space. Yet childrenâ€™s perspectives and agency are largely absent from research and public policy on issues that concern them. Common conceptualisations of children as vulnerable, incompetent, or unruly designate their marginalised status in the city. When gender is added, the deficit approach is reinforced. In this paper, we draw from theoretical and methodological approaches that affirm childrenâ€™s agency and focus analytical attention on how gendered spatialities are performed. Using cognitive mapping and semi-structured interviews with children aged eleven and twelve in Melbourne, Australia, the study explored the ways in which childrenâ€™s relationships with their neighbourhoods reflect, reproduce and resist gendered spatialities. We demonstrate that children are skilled â€˜spatial agentsâ€™, actively producing spatialities with awareness and intention, and clear gendered embodiment. Our analysis indicates the importance of engaging children in urban design and considering intersections of gender, age and power in contemporary cities."

"Traditionalism vs egalitarianism: Is there an association between gender attitudes and mental health? Child Care; Time Use; Domestic Division of Labour Objective: This study sought to assess the extent to which gender attitudes are associated with mental health among Australian men and women. Methods: This study used a sample of 26,188 individuals drawn from five waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. Gender attitudes were classified into three groups (traditional, moderate-egalitarian and egalitarian), and were constructed from six items. Mental health was measured using the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). We calculated the magnitude of associations between gender attitudes and mental health, stratified by gender, and adjusted for potential confounding. Results: Compared to men with egalitarian attitudes, poorer mental health was observed among men with moderate-egalitarian (âˆ’1.16, 95% confidence interval = [âˆ’1.84, âˆ’0.49]) and traditional gender attitudes (âˆ’2.57, 95% confidence interval = [âˆ’3.33, âˆ’1.81]). Among women, poorer mental health was observed among those with moderate-egalitarian (âˆ’0.78, 95% confidence interval = [âˆ’1.34, âˆ’0.22]) and traditional attitudes (âˆ’1.91, 95% confidence interval = [âˆ’2.55, âˆ’1.26]) compared to those with egalitarian attitudes. Conclusions: For both men and women, egalitarian gender attitudes were associated with better mental health."
"Co-opting and resisting market based instruments for private land conservation Payments For Ecosystem Services; Payment; China The increasing popularity of private land conservation (PLC) globally has quickly translated into an array of polices and programs aimed at achieving ecological benefits. The growth of PLC is entwined with the rise of neoliberal governance, with private land proving congruous with the promotion of market-based instruments (MBIs) and the reliance on private protected areas for conservation in lieu of government investment in public lands. Despite a growing literature on the implications of neoliberal environmental governance, there remains a need for specific insights into the way that individual landholders and ecologies can co-opt or resist the rationalities of MBIs in the practice of private land conservation. Through semi-structured interviews and property walks with 18 landholders, this research examines the implementation of a reverse-auction tender scheme called â€˜EcoTenderâ€™ in Victoria, Australia. We uncovered four main tensions between the market logic of the program and conservation practice: 1) some landholders used the payment scheme to increase regulatory protections on their property through covenants/easements; 2) many landholders struggled to conceive of their stewardship practice as contractual labour; 3) landholders were producing novel ecosystems that challenged land management focused at the property parcel scale when EcoTender encouraged a return to historical benchmark ecologies, and; 4) many landholders wanted social collaboration when the program required competition for cost efficiency. Our insights show that PLC must create room for a diverse trajectory of conservation practice in dynamic socio-ecological contexts. This means careful reflection on the validity of assumptions underpinning MBIs, the trade-offs that come with applying market logic to conservation and the long-term implications of these instruments for policy and practice."

"Polluters and access to informal finance - Is it important to go green? This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to shed light on the relationship between carbon risk and trade credit - a viable source of informal finance. Our study uncovers and tests two economic mechanisms through which carbon emission affects firms' informal financing channels: cash flow uncertainty and financial distress risk. We also investigate whether raising public awareness of a firm's
""green"" reputation, through its participation in the Green Power Partnership (GPP) program, helps reduce the information gap between itself and suppliers, thus protecting the firm from the potential adverse impact of carbon risk on a firm's access to trade credit."

"Decision-making of municipal urban forest managers through the lens of governance Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Awareness of the benefits of urban trees has led many cities to develop ambitious targets to increase tree numbers and canopy cover. Policy instruments that guide the planning of cities recognize the need for new governance arrangements to implement this agenda. Urban forests are greatly influenced by the decisions of municipal managers, but there is currently no clear understanding of how municipal managers find support to implement their decisions via new governance arrangements. To fill this knowledge gap, we collected empirical data through interviews with 23 urban forest municipal managers in 12 local governments in Greater Melbourne and regional Victoria, Australia, and analysed these data using qualitative interpretative methods through a governance lens. The goal of this was to understand the issues and challenges, stakeholders, resources, processes, and rules behind the decision-making of municipal managers. Municipal managers said that urban densification and expansion were making it difficult for them to implement their strategies to increase tree numbers and canopy cover. The coordination of stakeholders was more important for managers to find support to implement their decisions than having a bigger budget. The views of the public or wider community and a municipal government culture of risk aversion were also making it difficult for municipal managers to implement their strategies. Decision-making priorities and processes were not the same across urban centres. Lack of space to grow trees in new developments, excessive tree removal, and public consultation, were ideas more frequently raised in inner urban centres, while urban expansion, increased active use of greenspaces, and lack of data/information about tree assets were concerns for outer and regional centres. Nonetheless, inter-departmental coordination was a common theme shared among all cities. Strengthening coordination processes is an important way for local governments to overcome these barriers and effectively implement their urban forest strategies."
"The emergence of international urban planning and design firms in China from an OLI perspective Hukou; China; Land Development There has been high demand for planning and design services at various scales in Chinese cities. International urban planning and design (UPD) firms have taken some of these opportunities. Despite the direct relevance of UPD industries for urbanisation and the important role of international UPD firms, little attention has been paid to their spatial and operational strategies. What are the drivers for international UPD firms appearing in China? What role have they played in Chinaâ€™s urbanisation? This research analysed the overall trend of international UPD firms operating in China based on an extensive survey and in-depth interviews with a number of these firms. The findings suggest that the emergence of international UPD firms is largely attributable to planning system reform and internal and global forces that can be understood by the advantages that comprise the OLI framework (ownership-, location-, and internalisation-specific advantages). Ownership-specific advantages such as high-quality urban planning and design skills are the most important element for these firms, contributing to globalised urbanisation. A high locational concentration of the international UPD firms has been observed in the largest Chinese cities, i.e. Shanghai and Beijing. The establishment of international UPD offices is not limited to single Chinese cities but is spreading as further opportunities are sought in and beyond China."

"Experimental and Theoretical Study on Mechanical Performance of a Sustainable Method to Simultaneously Generate Power and Fresh Water Electric Generators; Thermoelectric Cooling; Module Many regions around the world have limited access to clean water and power. Low-grade thermal energy in the form of industrial waste heat or non-concentrating solar thermal energy is an underutilized resource and can be used for water desalination and power generation. This paper experimentally and theoretically examines a thermoelectric-based simultaneous power generation and desalination system that can utilize low-grade thermal energy. The paper presents concept design and the theoretical analysis of the proposed system followed by experimental analysis and comparison with the theoretical estimations. Experiments were carried out at three heat loads 50, 100 and 150 W to achieve varying temperature gradients across thermoelectric generators. During the experiments, thermoelectric generators were maintained at a hot to cold side temperature difference between 20 to 60 Â°C. The experiments showed that the power generation flux and freshwater mass flux increased with the increase in the thermal energy source temperature. The power flux varied between 12 to 117 W/m2 of thermoelectric generator area, while freshwater mass flux varied between 4.8 to 23.7 kg/m2â‹…h. The specific thermal energy consumption varied between 3.6 to 5.7 MJ/kg of freshwater; this is comparable to the single-stage conventional distillation system."
Exploring the collapse of buildings in urban settings Forensic Engineering; Structural Design; Collapse The paper explores building collapses at the cross-cutting edges of urban sustainability and the socio-economic and political-cultural influences of vulnerability for the phenomenon-in departure from the traditional conceptualisation of the phenomenon as an 'engineering' problem. It confers insights into the influences of vulnerability for building collapse in the urban context and makes a case for a deeper level of analysis that places measures to tackle building failures within a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerabilities they are supposed to reduce.

"Bioremediation of biosolids with Phanerochaete chrysosporium culture filtrates enhances the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) Phenanthrenes; Bioremediation; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons The supplementation of agricultural soils with dewatered sewage sludge represents a technical solution not only to the disposal of the large quantities of biosolids generated daily, but also a potential means of increasing soil fertility and productivity. However, the presence of organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in biosolids limits their application to agricultural soils. The application of Phanerochaete chrysosporium, its lignocelluloytic cell-free extract, a commercial preparation of the laccase enzyme for the enhanced removal of three PAHs (naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene) at two different concentrations (1 and 10 mg gâˆ’1 biosolids) from a biosolid sample was assessed in terms of both PAH degradation and their impact on the microbial community of the biosolids. The addition of P. chrysosporium biomass, a commercial laccase preparation, a P. chrysosporium cell-free extract at low PAH concentrations (1 mg gâˆ’1 biosolids) and high PAH concentrations (10 mg gâˆ’1 biosolids) resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.05) in PAHs degradation when compared with the control (natural attenuation). P. chrysosporium cell-free extract showed the highest degradation impact with an average of 80%. The results suggest that this treatment could be commercially used to allow the potential application of biosolids to agricultural soil. Importantly, no obvious effect on the microbial diversity (bacteria and fungi) from PAH-contaminated biosolids was observed. Therefore, the addition of cell-free culture filtrates and bioaugmentation remediation strategies were shown to be effective as an environmentally benign treatment for the removal of PAHs associated with biosolids with potential for large-scale application."

"Addressing sexual harassment law’s inadequacies in altering behaviour and preventing harm: A structural approach Title VII; Transgender Persons; Affirmative Action Section 3(c) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) provides that one object of the Act is â€˜to eliminate, so far as is possible, discrimination involving sexual harassment in the workplace, in educational organisations and in other areas of public activityâ€™. This article argues that the Act, in its current form, is not adequate for achieving that object for two reasons: first, its operative provisions reflect a normative principle that has, as its aim, the compensation of harm but not the prevention of future harm; and second, it fails to recognise some systemic harms caused by sexual harassment. The article proposes a structural approach to workplace sexual harassment regulation, which involves a positive duty for organisations to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment and a regulatory framework aimed at putting in place the necessary motivations and incentives to ensure compliance with that duty. The article draws on insights from regulatory theory to explain how this regulatory approach can better serve the object of eliminating sexual harassment so far as is possible."

"The role of Australian local government in economic development: Building international engagement capacity International New Ventures; Born Global; Small And Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) Sister city relationships (SCRs) are a platform through which local governments (LGs) engage internationally. Increasingly, there is an expectation that such international engagement delivers economic opportunities and returns. Many LGs are therefore pursuing local economic development (LED) through their SCRs. Drawing on a national survey of Australian LGs (stage 1) and interviews with key council staff and stakeholders in five LG areas maintaining Australiaâ€“China SCRs (stage 2), this paper contributes to growing literature on LED by examining how LGs have developed their own capacities and supported local small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to engage internationally. Our findings reveal insights into how Australian LGs have achieved international engagement through two strategies that leverage their SCRs, namely building government's capabilities and developing SMEsâ€™ capabilities. This paper contributes new insights into the evolving role of LGs in LED, including both current experimentation, challenges, and future opportunities. Points for practitioners: A growing number of Australian local governments pursue LED through their Chinese sister city relationships. Supporting the internationalisation of SMEs is an emerging component of local government pursuit of LED. International engagement of local governments has necessitated enhanced capacities in human, external, and financial resources. Findings highlight the unique and often overlooked role of local-to-local diplomatic and economic relations."

"Building capacity for a user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought in the Northern Murray-Darling Basin Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China Drought frequently impacts both the agricultural productivity and the well-being of farming communities in drought-prone areas of Australia, including the largest agricultural region in the countryâ€”the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). Improving drought preparedness of farming communities in the MDB could be achieved by building capacity for a user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought. In this study, a prospective I-EWS was investigated. Farming individuals were interviewed to inductively guide the selection of drought-related indices most appropriate for the study area. Based on interview results and desktop research, five drought-related indices directly relevant to the MDB were selected as inputs to the trigger levels for an I-EWS: the Standardised Precipitation Index, the Vegetation Health Index, Soil Moisture (percent of normal), the likelihood of exceeding median rainfall in a coming month, and the chance of El NiÃ±o. Based on these inputs, decision rules were formulated for a staged â€œWATCH,â€ â€œALERTâ€ and â€œDECLARATIONâ€ drought early warnings. These decision rules were tested for the intense dry period from 2017 to 2019 for five key agricultural Local Government Areas in the Northern MDB. It was found that all three stages of the drought I-EWS were adequately triggered, indicating that a warning lead time of 3â€“8 months could have been possible in the dry period. Data for the selected inputs are readily obtained from space-based products as well as national meteorological services and would be applicable to regions with limited observing networks or forecast capability. Thus, while the methodologies developed in this study and the resultant outcomes are tailored to the Northern MDB, this research ultimately serves as both a successful proof of concept for the drought EWS as well as a foundational base for the design of an operational user-centred I-EWS in susceptible to drought regions of Australia and other countries."

Specifically, this comprises three objectives:
(i) identifying control sites on private land specifically for quantifying the observed loss of vegetation over time, allowing counterfactuals for conservation sites to be estimated that incorporate the risk of total loss 
(ii) evaluating the use of the Land and Soil Capability (LSC) spatial layer as a surrogate to estimate the risk of future biodiversity loss or degradation 
(iii) develop approaches to use predictive modelling and scenario analyses to predict likely future counterfactuals at existing and proposed conservation sites. "

"Frequency and characteristics of police involvement in potentially criminal behaviour in disability services Mental Deficiency; Sex Offenders; Learning Disorders Some reluctance exists among disability staff to report to police potentially criminal behaviour by people with intellectual disabilities. Both the nature and frequency of these behaviours and decision-making processes of staff concerning police involvement remain poorly understood. This study sought to explore potentially criminal behaviour by people living in disability services and the frequency of police involvement. A broad spectrum of potentially criminal behaviours was reported, most frequently involving acts of physical aggression. Police were contacted in 101/370 (27%) of the incidents reported; two-thirds involved acts where there was an identifiable victim; incidents reported to police were most likely to occur outside the disability service. A more detailed understanding of disability staff decision-making as it relates to initiating contact with the police, and the immediate and long-term issues and benefits concerning police contact and intervention, is required so as to more effectively prevent and manage potentially criminal behaviour."

"Recent Advances in Chemical Biology of Mitochondria Targeting Decyltriphenylphosphonium; Mitochondrion; Antioxidant Mitochondria are vital subcellular organelles that generate most cellular chemical energy, regulate cell metabolism and maintain cell function. Mitochondrial dysfunction is directly linked to numerous diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, thyroid squamous disease, cancer and septicemia. Thus, the design of specific mitochondria-targeting molecules and the realization of real-time acquisition of mitochondrial activity are powerful tools in the study and treatment of mitochondria dysfunction in related diseases. Recent advances in mitochondria-targeting agents have led to several important mitochondria chemical probes that offer the opportunity for selective targeting molecules, novel biological applications and therapeutic strategies. This review details the structural and physiological functional characteristics of mitochondria, and comprehensively summarizes and classifies mitochondria-targeting agents. In addition, their pros and cons and their related chemical biological applications are discussed. Finally, the potential biomedical applications of these agents are briefly prospected."
"Hybrid analysis for understanding contact tracing apps adoption Technology Acceptance Model; Mobile Payment; E-Learning Purpose: This study aims to explore the adoption of contact tracing apps through a hybrid analysis of the collected data using structural equation modelling (SEM) and artificial neural networks (ANN), leading to the identification of the critical determinants for the adoption of contact tracing apps in Australia. Design/methodology/approach: A research model is developed within the background of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and the privacy calculus theory (PCT) for investigating the adoption of contact tracing apps. This model is then tested and validated using a hybrid SEM-ANN analysis of the survey data. Findings: The study shows that effort expectancy, perceived value of information disclosure and social influence are critical for adopting contact tracing apps. It reveals that performance expectancy and perceived privacy risks are indirectly significant on the adoption through the influence of perceived value of information disclosure. Furthermore, the study finds out that facilitating condition is insignificant to the adoption of contact tracing apps. Practical implications: The findings of the study can lead to the formulation of targeted strategies and policies for promoting the adoption of contact tracing apps and inform future epidemic control for better emergency management. Originality/value: This study is the first attempt in integrating UTAUT and PCT for exploring the adoption of contact tracing apps in Australia. It combines SEM and ANN for analysing the survey data, leading to better understanding of the critical determinants for the adoption of contact tracing apps."

"Compensation committees, CEO pay and firm performance Executive Compensation; Firm; Chief Executive Officer We examine whether compensation committee existence (CCX) and compensation committee effectiveness (CCE) are associated with CEO pay-performance alignment, using data drawn from a sample of Australian listed companies. We find that compensation committee existence and effectiveness are positively associated with CEO pay-performance alignment. Further, our results show that the relationships hold for the pre- and post-GFC (Global Financial Crisis) periods but not for the crisis period. This evidence supports the prospect theory argument that in times of macroeconomic crisis, uncontrollable factors external to the firm constitute a firm's reference point for making executive remuneration decisions. These results are robust to alternative measures of firm performance and CEO cash compensation as well as tests of endogeneity. Overall, our evidence suggests that compensation committees contribute to addressing agency problems pertinent to contemporary corporate governance practices."

"Zinc biofortified wheat cultivar lessens grain cadmium accumulation under cadmium contaminated conditions Biofortification; Zinc Fertilizers; Triticum Turgidum Subsp. Durum Zinc (Zn) efficient wheat genotypes have been developed to enhance grain Zn concentration to combat the Zn malnutrition in humans. However, such biofortified genotypes/cultivars may also take up the toxic metals from heavy-metals contaminated soils due to similarities with Zn uptake and transport mechanisms in plants. This study was designed to explore uptake of a ubiquitous toxic metal i.e., cadmium (Cd) by a Zn-efficient (Zincol-2016) and was compared with Zn-inefficient (Faisalabad- 2008) wheat cultivar. Both wheat cultivars were sown in pots till maturity in Zn and Cd amended soil. Growth and yield response, and distribution of Cd and Zn, in roots, shoot and grains were observed. Significant differences in Zn and Cd concentration in root, shoot and grain were found among both cultivars in response of Zn and Cd application. Zincol-2016 was more efficient cultivar for Zn uptake compared to the Faisalabad-2008. Cd uptake was increased by both cultivars and suppressed plant growth in Cd contaminated soil. However, Zn application in Cd contaminated soil significantly diminished the Cd uptake and vice versa. Interestingly, Cd concentration was higher in root of Zincol-2016 as compared to Faisalabad-2008; similar was the case in shoot of both cultivars, while it was lower in grain of Zincol-2016. In conclusion, Zn efficient cultivar not only produces high Zn grains but also has ability to contain Cd in root and shoot reducing its accumulation in grains. Furthermore, Zn fertilization in Cd contaminated soils can decrease Cd uptake by plants and may be used as an ameliorating strategy to grow wheat in Cd contaminated soils."

"Application of a adaptive neuro-fuzzy technique for projection of the greenhouse gas emissions from road transportation Environmental Kuznets Curve; China; Trade Openness In the past, different forecasting models have been proposed to predict greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, most of these models are unable to handle non-linear data. One of the most widely known techniques, the Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), can deal with nonlinear data. Its ability to predict GHG emissions from road transportation is still unexplored. This study aims to fulfil that gap by adapting the ANFIS model to predict GHG emissions from road transportation by using the ratio between vehicle-kilometers and number of transportation vehicles for six transportation modes (passenger cars, motorcycle, light trucks, single-unit trucks, tractors, and buses) from the North American Transportation Statistics (NATS) online database over a period of 22 years. The results show that ANFIS is a suitable method to forecast GHG emissions from the road transportation sector."
"Advances in transcriptomics of plants Argonaute Proteins; Gene; Nicotiana Benthamiana The current global population of 7.3 billion is estimated to reach 9.7 billion in the year 2050. Rapid population growth is driving up global food demand. Additionally, global climate change, environmental degradation, drought, emerging diseases, and salty soils are the current threats to global food security. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of these diverse agricultural productivity constraints and enhance crop yield and stress-tolerance in plants, we need to go beyond traditional and molecular plant breeding. The powerful new tools for genome editing, Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) and Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas systems (CRISPR-Cas9), have been hailed as a quantum leap forward in the development of stress-resistant plants. Plant breeding techniques, however, have several drawbacks. Hence, identification of transcriptional regulatory elements and deciphering mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation are crucial to avoiding unintended consequences in modified crop plants, which could ultimately have negative impacts on human health. RNA splicing as an essential regulated post-transcriptional process, alternative polyadenylation as an RNA-processing mechanism, along with non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, small interfering RNAs and long non-coding RNAs) have been identified as major players in gene regulation. In this chapter, we highlight new findings on the essential roles of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation in plant development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. We also discuss biogenesis and the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants and recent advances in our knowledge of the roles of miRNAs and siRNAs in plant stress response."

"Sense of belonging in second-year undergraduate students: the value of extracurricular activities Community Colleges; Financial Aid; Enrollment This article presents empirical evidence on how second-year studentsâ€™ sense of belonging and overall experience can be improved through a carefully designed extracurricular activity as an effective approach to practically integrate academic and social dimensions of belongingness. Data were collected at multiple points for this exploratory study that involved a self-administered questionnaire survey with 50 participants followed by a post-activity focus group to explore the effect of cultural awareness on second-year studentsâ€™ belongingness. Informed by Tintoâ€™s student integration model and extant belonging literature, our findings highlight the importance of all three elements of belongingnessâ€“social, academic and informalâ€“to co-exist in the design of the extracurricular activity for effectively addressing several challenges associated with second-year undergraduate studentsâ€™ belonging, overall experience and retention. Our study aligns with the best practice approach of ensuring a connection between an extracurricular activity, course material and skill development for a globalised workforce. The study offers important implications for universities about how to benefit from this approach in seeking to meet the distinctive needs of second-year students and developing well-targeted programmes to increase their satisfaction and academic achievements, and ultimately retentionâ€“a weakness still seen in the literature."

"Comprehensive Resilience Assessment of Complex Urban Public Spaces: A Perspective of Promoting Sustainability Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Complex urban systems, such as multi-floor rail transit stations and integrated railway transport hubs, are termed â€œcomplex urban public spacesâ€ (CUPSs). These CUPSs facilitate peopleâ€™s lives, but, at the same time, are threatened by various risks due to their multi-floor structure, dense crowds, high correlation in multi-function, complex facilities, and space openness. The risk events of CUPSs could have a negative influence on public safety and further influence sustainable development. Increasing the resilience of CUPSs is an effective way to respond to risks and guarantee public safety. Therefore, it is necessary to first assess the resilience of CUPSs. In this paper, a six-level comprehensive resilience indicator system was established based on aspects of the essence of resilience. Used in combination with the methods of resilience impact score and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process, the resilience value could be calculated. The Shenzhen North Railway Station (SZ) and the Guangzhou South Railway Station (GZ) were used to validate the proposed methodology. The established resilience indicator system was shown to be comprehensive and innovative, and, regarding practicality, the proposed assessment methodology is convenient to use. This research can help policymakers to assess the resilience of CUPSs and develop relevant policies to improve the resilience of buildings, which can further enhance urban sustainability."

"The interdependence of public and private stakeholder influence: A study of political patronage and corporate philanthropy in China Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy We argue that the influence of public stakeholders (the state) and private stakeholders (nonstate social or economic stakeholders) on corporate philanthropy is interdependent, in that satisfying the state may increase the degree of scrutiny and pressure exerted by private stakeholders on the firm, particularly in institutional environments that place few checks and balances on the power of the state â€“ thus creating suspicion that political patronage shelters firmsâ€™ social and moral wrongdoing. To test this theory, we examine the circumstances under which politically patronized firms engage more (or less) in corporate philanthropy. Utilizing a dataset that encompasses both publically traded and unlisted private firms in China, we find that corporate philanthropy is negatively associated with political patronage among unlisted firms but positively associated with political patronage among listed firms. These results are consistent with the predictions made based on our theoretical arguments. This chapter aims to foster further discussion regarding the interdependence of the influences exerted by different stakeholders on firms."

"Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling in the Circular Economy: A Review Lithium-ion Batteries; Nickel Metal Hydride Batteries; Leaching Lithium-ion batteries have become a crucial part of the energy supply chain for transportation (in electric vehicles) and renewable energy storage systems. Recycling is considered one of the most effective ways for recovering the materials for spent LIB streams and circulating the material in the critical supply chain. However, few review articles have been published in the research domain of recycling and the circular economy, with most mainly focusing on either recycling methods or the challenges and opportunities in the circular economy for spent LIBs. This paper reviewed 93 articles (66 original research articles and 27 review articles) identified in the Web of Science core collection database. The study showed that publications in the area are increasing exponentially, with many focusing on recycling and recovery-related issues; policy and regulatory affairs received less attention than recycling. Most of the studies were experiments followed by evaluation and plan-ning (as per the categorization made). Pre-treatment processes were widely discussed, which is a critical part of hydrometallurgy and direct physical recycling (DPR). DPR is a promising recycling technique that requires further attention. Some of the issues that require further consideration in-clude a techno-economic assessment of the recycling process, safe reverse logistics, a global EV assessment revealing material recovery potential, and a lifecycle assessment of experiments processes (both in the hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes). Furthermore, the application of the circular business model and associated stakeholdersâ€™ engagement, clear and definitive policy guidelines, extended producer responsibility implications, and material tracking, and identification deserve further focus. This study presents several future research directions that would be useful for academics and policymakers taking necessary steps such as product design, integrated recycling techniques, intra-industry stakeholder cooperation, business model development, techno-economic analysis, and others towards achieving a circular economy in the LIB value chain."

"The impact of multidimensional disadvantage over childhood on developmental outcomes in Australia Socioeconomic Position; Cohort Studies; Midlife Background: Understanding the relationship between different aspects of disadvantage over time and domains of child development will facilitate the formulation of more precise policy responses. We examined the association between exposure to aspects of disadvantage over the childhood period (from 0â€“9 years) and child development at 10â€“11 years. Methods: We used data from the nationally representative birth cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n Â¼ 4979). Generalized linear models with log-Poisson link were used to estimate the association between previously derived disadvantage trajectories (in each of four lenses of sociodemographic, geographic environments, health conditions and risk factors, and a composite of these) and risk of poor child developmental outcomes. Population-attributable fractions were calculated to quantify the potential benefit of providing all children with optimal conditions for each developmental outcome. Results: Trajectories of disadvantage were associated with developmental outcomes: children in the most disadvantaged composite trajectory had seven times higher risk of poor outcomes on two or more developmental domains, compared with those most advantaged. Trajectories of disadvantage in different lenses were varyingly associated with the child development domains of socio-emotional adjustment, physical functioning and learning competencies. Exposure to the most advantaged trajectory across all lenses could reduce poor developmental outcomes by as much as 70%. Conclusions: Exposure to disadvantage over time is associated with adverse child development outcomes. Developmental outcomes varied with the aspects of disadvantage experienced, highlighting potential targets for more precise policy responses. The findings provide evidence to stimulate advocacy and action to reduce child inequities."
"Bittersweet? Urban proximity and wine tourism in the Swan Valley Region Wine; Hedonic Price Function; Implicit Price Proximity to the target market is deemed desirable for tourism destinations, including wine-tourism. Yet, it also translates into a range of problems. While research into wine regions has exponentially grown over the last two decades, the majority of research in wine tourism focuses on the demand side with little attention to supply side dynamics that impact development. This paper considers the realities of the supply side of a wine tourism region, i.e. the perspectives of business owners, service providers and authorities, and reports on the perceptions and challenges as noted by a range of stakeholders in the Swan Valley in Western Australia as a distinct wine tourism area. The study highlights how proximity to an urban market can be a major challenge for an industry based on agri-business in a rural setting. The research has policy implications for local and state authorities, particularly in terms of alignment relating to land-use and infrastructure."

"A study of sustainable practices in the sustainability leadership of international contractors Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative With an increasing global need for sustainable development, numerous world-leading construction corporations have devoted significant efforts to implementing sustainable practices. However, few previous studies have shared these valuable experiences in a systematic and quantitative way. RobecoSAM has published The Sustainability Yearbook annually since 2004, which lists the sustainability leaders in various industries, including the construction industry. Learning from those sustainability leaders in the construction industry can provide useful references for construction-related companies when developing their sustainable development strategies. Based on a comprehensive literature review, this paper identified 51 methods used for improving sustainability performance and 34 outcomes achieved via these methods. These methods and outcomes are used for coding the sustainable practices of sustainability leaders in the construction sector. Using the coding system, 133 annual sustainability reports issued by 22 sustainability leaders (The Sustainability Yearbook, RobecoSAM 2010â€“2016) in the construction sector were analyzed using content analysis. Social network analysis was then employed to identify the key adopted methods and achieved outcomes (KAMAO) of these leaders. The dynamic trend and regional analysis of KAMAO are also presented. These KAMAO findings provide valuable guidance for international contractors to develop a better understanding of the primary sustainable methods adopted by sustainability leaders in the construction sector and the top outcomes achieved by these leaders. The findings also provide a useful reference for international contractors to evaluate their current sustainability-related strategies and make improvements."

"How positive service experiences contribute to service captivity Debt; Personal Finance; Credit Cards Purpose: Service captivity is described as the experience of constrained choice whereby a consumer has no power and feels unable to exit a service relationship. This study aims to explore how positive service experiences can contribute to service captivity in the alternative financial services (AFS) sector for consumers experiencing financial vulnerability. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 31 interviews were undertaken with Australian consumers of payday loans and/or consumer leases. Findings: The authors reveal a typology of consumers based on their financial vulnerability and their experience with AFS providers. Then they present three themes relating to how the marketing practices of these providers create a positive service experience, and, in doing so, can contribute to service captivity for consumers experiencing financial vulnerability. Research limitations/implications: The benefits derived from positive service experiences, including accessible solutions, self-esteem, and a sense of control over their financial situation, contribute to the service captivity of some consumers, rendering alternative avenues less attractive. Practical implications: AFS providers must ensure a socially responsible approach to their marketing practices to minimize potentially harmful outcomes for consumers. However, a systems-level approach is needed to tackle the wider issue of financial precarity. Policymakers need to address the marketplace gaps, regulatory frameworks and social welfare policies that contribute to both vulnerability and captivity. Originality/value: This research extends the understanding of service captivity by demonstrating how positive service experiences can perpetuate this situation. Further, specific solutions are proposed at each level of the service system to address service captivity in the AFS sector."

"Land tenure and urban climate resilience in the South Pacific Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Urbanisation trends and global environmental change are two of the most critical modern-day stressors threatening the resilience of cities around the world. This paper focuses on Honiara, the capital city of the Solomon Islands, which is experiencing rapid urbanisation and a resultant spread of informal settlements. Similar to other primary cities in the South Pacific, the rate of urbanisation is severely testing the local governmentâ€™s ability to respond to growing levels of informality; and increasing the climate vulnerability of residents. Based on recent urban climate resilience and land tenure research conducted for the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) and the Global Land Tool Network (GLTN) respectively, the paper analyses land issues in two informal settlements in Honiara to highlight the inter-linkages between security of land tenure and climate vulnerability, and how insecure land tenure adversely impacts local adaptive capacity and adaptation planning. This analysis is embedded in the context of the South Pacific region, where duality tensions exist between Western-influenced land tenure arrangements within cities - a legacy of colonial times - and customary arrangements that operate in the surrounding peri-urban and provincial areas. Given the identification of strong links between security of land tenure and climate vulnerability, and the complexity of property rights in the region, the paper argues that principles of good land governance are an essential component of climate resilience thinking and actions."

"The emerging future: Innovative models of work-integrated learning Placement; Cooperative Education; Employability Work-integrated learning (WIL) is a national priority and a strategic direction for Australian universities. To increase industry engagement, there is a need to identify emerging WIL models that enable flexibility while optimizing outcomes for stakeholders. This Australian Technology Network (ATN) project explored approaches that overcome constraints to engagement, particularly for small to medium enterprises (SMEs). The preliminary qualitative phase comprised a literature review, workshops and interviews. Examples of emerging WIL models, both curricula and co-curricular, were clustered into five models: micro-placements, online projects or placements, hackathons, competitions and events, incubators/ start-ups and consulting. This paper outlines these models and summarizes defining features, enablers, challenges and opportunities. Contemporary trends informing innovative WIL design and implementation emerged. Features fell into three broad areas, stakeholder engagement, design elements and co-design with partners. Enablers, challenges and opportunities in the implementation of these WIL models that respond to the changing nature of work were documented."

These findings have implications for sustaining inclusive education and are discussed in relation to contextual variables and student demands."
"Room temperature CO2 reduction to solid carbon species on liquid metals featuring atomically thin ceria interfaces Carbon Dioxide; Electrocatalysts; Chemical Reduction Negative carbon emission technologies are critical for ensuring a future stable climate. However, the gaseous state of CO2 does render the indefinite storage of this greenhouse gas challenging. Herein, we created a liquid metal electrocatalyst that contains metallic elemental cerium nanoparticles, which facilitates the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to layered solid carbonaceous species, at a low onset potential of âˆ’310 mV vs CO2/C. We exploited the formation of a cerium oxide catalyst at the liquid metal/electrolyte interface, which together with cerium nanoparticles, promoted the room temperature reduction of CO2. Due to the inhibition of van der Waals adhesion at the liquid interface, the electrode was remarkably resistant to deactivation via coking caused by solid carbonaceous species. The as-produced solid carbonaceous materials could be utilised for the fabrication of high-performance capacitor electrodes. Overall, this liquid metal enabled electrocatalytic process at room temperature may result in a viable negative emission technology."

"More than a snapshot in time: Pathways of disadvantage over childhood Socioeconomic Position; Cohort Studies; Midlife Background: Disadvantage rarely manifests as a single event, but rather is the enduring context in which a child's development unfolds. We aimed to characterize patterns of stability and change in multiple aspects of disadvantage over the childhood period, in order to inform more precise and nuanced policy development. Methods: Participants were from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children birth cohort (n=5107). Four lenses of disadvantage (sociodemographic, geographic environment, health conditions and risk factors), and a composite of these representing average exposure across all lenses, were assessed longitudinally from 0 to 9 years of age. Trajectory models identified groups of children with similar patterns of disadvantage over time for each of these lenses and for composite disadvantage. Concurrent validity of these trajectory groups was examined through associations with academic performance at 10-11 years. Results: We found four distinct trajectories of children's exposure to composite disadvantage, which showed high levels of stability over time. In regard to the individual lenses of disadvantage, three exhibited notable change over time (the sociodemographic lens was the exception). Over a third of children (36.3%) were exposed to the 'most disadvantaged' trajectory in at least one lens. Trajectories of disadvantage were associated with academic performance, providing evidence of concurrent validity. Conclusions: Children's overall level of composite disadvantage was stable over time, whereas geographic environments, health conditions and risk factors changed over time for some children. Measuring disadvantage as uni-dimensional, at a single time point, is likely to understate the true extent and persistence of disadvantage."
"The impact of FDI on regional air pollution in the Republic of Korea: A way ahead to achieve the green growth strategy? Environmental Kuznets Curve; China; Trade Openness Can FDI help to reduce regional air pollution emissions in Korea? Given the proclamation of a far-reaching national green growth strategy that requires a shift in public and private investments, this paper addresses the need for empirical estimates on the environmental consequences of FDI inflows into Korea. Using a simultaneous equations model the impacts of FDI inflows are decomposed into direct as well as indirect scale, composition, and technique effects. Thereby, the analysis utilizes panel data on six air pollutants in 16 Korean provinces and self-governing cities for the period 2000 to 2011. The estimation results show that FDI inflows concurrently stimulate regional economic growth and reduce air pollution intensities. However, the total level of air emissions mostly remains unchanged. While confirming the findings of the existing national level research on the FDI-growth relationship in Korea, the results are partly contrary to the respective earlier findings on the FDI-environment nexus. Given Korea's high level of development paired with the aforementioned impact on economic growth and air pollution intensities, foreign investments are, therefore, regarded as one potential pillar to achieve the goals of the green growth strategy."

"Exploration of roadway factors and habitat quality using InVEST Road Kills; Collision; Wildlife Roadways vary in structural, geotechnical, locational, and operational properties, and synergies among these factors may present overwhelming challenges to understanding their full effects on the habitat quality (HQ). To explore the impact of dense roadway networks on an ecologically fragile region in the northwest of China, this study applied the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) to evaluate the HQ spatiotemporal distribution of the study area. Then, Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) were formulated to examine the cumulative impact due to the operation of an increasing amount of roadways over the past two decades. According to the results, the influence of different road types on the HQ was apparent within the road-effect zone, and road grading reduction, road length and operation duration increase can harm the HQ within the road-effect zone. Overall, this study generates knowledge concerning the design and operation of environmentally-friendly roadways in ecologically fragile areas."

"The genetic basis of the anti-fungal activity of probiotic strains of Lactobacillus The use of microorganisms in agriculture is an expanding area of research, as it is becoming more evident that they play a large ro le in the overall health, and therefore yield, of both plants, and animals. They have the potentiaI to increase biomass, increase biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, and reduce disease in plants, as well being able to mediate the health of animals. Previously, several strains of Lactobacillus, which are currently used in a commercial formulation of microbial inoculant, were characterised for their antifungal activity aga in st plant pathogens. Several isolates demonstrated very strong anti-fungal activity in vitro, and some of the compounds identified may have positive effects on plant growth. Additionally, there is some evidence that these isolates also have positive effects on animal health. The goal of this project is to investigate some of the beneficial effects of Lactobacillus isolates."
"Activist ecologies of study in the learning city: deformalisations of educational life Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work The combined impacts of COVID-19 and global climate change are destabilising the infrastructures and future prospects of formal educational systems, with schools and universities struggling to adapt to conditions of radical precarity. At the same time, activist movements are generating alter-educational platforms that reappropriate the learning infrastructures of cities as mobile architectures of pedagogical resistance. Building on Harney and Motenâ€™s The Undercommons, this paper discusses transnational examples of radical pedagogies that engage the city as an ecology of deformalised study. We highlight examples from Melbourneâ€™s COVID-19 lockdown regime, emphasising how informal study enabled community-led responses to crisis at city-scale. We then turn to urban ecologies of study arising from contemporary activist movements, drawing connections between protest movements in Hong Kong and Deleuze and Guattariâ€™s concept of the â€˜war machineâ€™. This leads to a speculative re-imagining of alternative educational values and futures within a milieu of activist study, care, and resistance."

"Consequences of season of prescribed burning on two spring-flowering terrestrial orchids and their endophytic fungi Germination; Tulasnella; Cephalanthera Prescribed burning is mandated in seasonally dry regions of the world to reduce fuel load and fire risk. This study investigated the effects of prescribed burning at different seasons on two Australian terrestrial orchids (Glossodia major R.Br. and Thelymitra pauciflora R.Br.) and their orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) to find the least damaging season for a burn. Burns were conducted mid-season in autumn, winter, spring and summer. Orchids were enumerated and measured and their OMF isolated during their flowering seasons. The OMF were grouped and identified using their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and tested for sensitivity to smoke water. Orchid numbers decreased by up to 100% after autumn and winter burns but not spring and summer burns. Plant height, leaf and flower dimensions decreased between the two years. Fire reduced success in the isolation of OMF. The relative frequencies of ITS sequences of Serendipita Roberts from G. major (but not of Tulasnella asymmetrica Warcup and P.H.B. Talbot from Th. pauciflora) changed after burns. OMF from G. major were up to 100% inhibited by smoke water, twice the inhibition of the OMF from Th. pauciflora. Prescribed burning during active orchid growth damaged both the orchids and their OMF. The least damaging practical season for a prescribed burn was in late spring, soon after seed dispersal."

"Ultrasonic microencapsulation of oil-soluble vitamins by hen egg white and green tea for fortification of food Drug Delivery Systems; Targeted Drug Delivery; Microcapsule We report the microencapsulation of oil soluble vitamins (A, D and E) using a one pot ultrasonic process and raw egg white proteins as a shell material. Green tea catechin/iron complex coating method was further developed to impart UV filtering property to the microcapsules in order to protect the encapsulated nutrients from photodegradation. The microcapsules showed antibacterial properties and long shelf-life. The encapsulated vitamins were protected from degradation upon heating, UV irradiation, simulated storage/transit and cooking processes. The in-vitro digestion study showed that functional vitamin D can be potentially released in the gastrointestinal tract improving vitamin D availability by more than 2-fold compared to the free vitamin. The vitamin D microcapsules were highly stable and maintained their microstructures once incorporated into staple food products. The low-cost egg white shell encapsulated vitamins can improve the nutritional value of staple food products to combat maternal and child malnutrition."

"Harnessing the power of the gut-brain axis; dietary manipulations as a therapy in a model of preterm infant brain injury The data from this project is envisaged to support our hypothesis that after an early life inflammatory challenge that recapitulates preterm infant brain damage, ongoing microbiome disturbances alter gastrointestinal structure and function alongside changes in brain structure and function. We also hypothesise that treatment of preterm born infants with the polysaccharide fucoidan will potentially improve the associated nervous system damage. Fucoidan is a complex polysaccharide found in many species of brown seaweed. Fucoidan has previously been shown in pre-clinical studies to restore the microbiome and decrease systemic inflammation when provided as a dietary supplement [1]. Fucoidan is safe to use in humans, being shown to decrease circulating levels of pro-inflammatory marker interleukin-6 and to decrease monocyte phagocytosis [2]. Fucoidan is detected in the blood of humans following ingestion [3]. The industry partner Marinova will provide Fucoidan (i.e. food grade standard seaweed extract) for this project. 

We will employ a well validated animal model of the inflammatory injury of the preterm born infant [4, 5].  In this model we will show the effects of perinatal injury on the gut microbiome, and myelin integrity using a novel, transportable non-invasive and translatable approach; subsurface Raman spectroscopy for investigating the biochemistry of brain tissue in situ, such as a signature for myelin integrity.  We will validate our novel Raman data with conventional immunohistological approaches.  In this model using these translatable techniques we will also test the neuro- and enteroprotective ability of dietary fucoidan. Gastrointestinal tissues will also be banked from animals in this project for future analysis following positive outcomes from this study."

"The Role of Biochar in Sustainable Agriculture, and Climate Change Mitigation for Sustainable Cities Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Sustainable development is facing a transformation. One solution finding its place as a key strategy in a number of sustainable development goal areas is biochar. Biochar is a geo-engineered bi-product that is similar in appearance to charcoal which differs from charcoal in that the organic biomass waste from which it is created is heated in an enclosed chamber to low temperatures and deprived of oxygen. This paper investigates the latest studies in crop productivity, commercial viabilities, and the socio-economic options of biochar production at a local and international level in the pursuit of sustainability and climate change mitigation. In terms of sustainability the uptake of biochar as a model for sustainable agriculture is steadily gaining momentum due to its agronomic potential for crop yields, organic soil carbon, carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The economic viability of biochar production varies markedly around the world. The most promising opportunities for soil carbon sequestration have derived from voluntary carbon markets and government initiatives such as Australiaâ€™s Emissions Reduction Fund. The scheme promoted the integration of biochar in land use management practices at a farm scale. If biochar is to have a more profound impact on a global scale, then countries need to adopt a sustainable biochar strategy which is universal along with standardised sustainability protocols."

"Managing in a war zone: Somalian managers in the banking and mobile telecommunications sectors Resilience; Dynamic Capabilities; Organizational Culture Orientation: Management studies too often concentrate on supposedly normal market conditions in stable, developed countries. In reality, most forms of management are conducted in more trying circumstances, and this article seeks to expand knowledge of how it takes place under difficult conditions. Research purpose: This study explored management techniques under wartime conditions exhibited by managers in the banking and mobile telecommunications sectors in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. Motivation for the study: Somalia is a fragile state that risks failing its people in many ways, including security, food security and basic public services. One means of compensating for these failures is the private sectorâ€™s ability to organise not just business but essential public services when the government is unable to do so. This article studied whether that was taking place. Research approach/design and method: The research was qualitative in nature and featured in-depth, personal interviews with managers and executives in the identified sectors of interest. Respondents were identified through convenience and then purposive snowball sampling techniques. Main findings: It was found that adaptations to managing in wartime could be divided into three main themes: practical aspects of managing in adversity, coping mechanisms and the ethical issues involved in managing without a government. In general, in the absence of a legitimate ruling power or a form of market regulation, managers reverted to the pre-existing tribal system as a means not just of managing transactions but also to instil trust in those transactions. Practical/managerial implications: A model is provided for managing under wartime or similarly difficult situations, which might be adapted to other contexts. Contribution/value-add: This article extends knowledge of how management is conducted in wartime and how managers adapt to adverse conditions."

"Identification of micro-plastics in Australian road dust Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter The threat of micro-plastics in the marine environment is seriously being recognized worldwide for the dangers it is posing to not only the marine life and biodiversity but even to the human beings that form part of this food chain. The majority of these micro-plastics are considered to be generated from the wear-out of vehicle tyres. In Australia, there is a complete lack of scientific evidence to support the extent to which MPs are released from the road dust. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify the presence of micro-plastics in Australian road dust and the results were validated using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy material characterization techniques. The results clearly show the presence of a large number of tyre wear-out particles in small amounts of road dust samples collected from two separate suburban locations of metropolitan Melbourne area."

"Adaptive governance in carbon farming policies Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework This book discusses a variety of different perspectives involved in biodiversity management and bio-sequestration projects in Australia, working towards achieving adaptive governance in carbon farming. It not only examines landholders' motivation but also the challenges of integrating biodiverse forests into the agricultural landscape. Drawing on the contrast between science and policy stakeholders' views on carbon farming and the practical challenges of achieving adaptive governance, the book discusses the significant gap between theory and practice encountered in this field of study. The book suggests ways of improving the decision-making capacity of government officials and policymakers involved in managing carbon and biodiversity markets, as well as introducing measures to promote adaptive governance by engaging landholders in more effective land conservation. Climate change is a pressing issue on the global political agenda, and this book makes an important contribution to the ongoing debate. This book will be an invaluable reference for practitioners, policymakers and researchers interested in alternative forms of governance in natural resource management."

"Disability, technology innovation and social development in China and Australia Social Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Impact Investing This paper examines the turn to technology innovation in disability policy, as it has manifested in the accessibility and digital inclusion agendas in China and Australia. It provides a review of the disability policy changes and related initiatives in both countries to offer insights for broader discussions of digital technology innovation and social policy in Asia. We argue that while governments take pivotal roles in formulating and implementing digital disability policies, people with disabilities apply their own agency to take advantage of market opportunities through economic participation in digital economy. The state responds positively to the agency of people with disabilities in social development and participation by opening opportunities for research grants, start-up funds, publicities and policy lobbying. It is here we see the hope in such a collaborative and mutually constitutive approach to innovative social policies that aim at inclusive and sustainable growthâ€“something that deserves concerted, comparative research and evaluation by policy scholars."
"A novel ensemble modeling approach for the spatial prediction of tropical forest fire susceptibility using LogitBoost machine learning classifier and multi-source geospatial data Landslides; Debris Flow; Susceptibility A reliable forest fire susceptibility map is a necessity for disaster management and a primary reference source in land use planning. We set out to evaluate the use of the LogitBoost ensemble-based decision tree (LEDT) machine learning method for forest fire susceptibility mapping through a comparative case study at the Lao Cai region of Vietnam. A thorough literature search would indicate the method has not previously been applied to forest fires. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and Kernel logistic regression (KLR) were used as benchmarks in the comparative evaluation. A fire inventory database for the study area was constructed based on data of previous forest fire occurrences, and related conditioning factors were generated from a number of sources. Thereafter, forest fire probability indices were computed through each of the four modeling techniques, and performances were compared using the area under the curve (AUC), Kappa index, overall accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). The LEDT model produced the best performance, both on the training and on validation datasets, demonstrating a 92% prediction capability. Its overall superiority over the benchmarking models suggests that it has the potential to be used as an efficient new tool for forest fire susceptibility mapping. Fire prevention is a critical concern for local forestry authorities in tropical Lao Cai region, and based on the evidence of our study, the method has a potential application in forestry conservation management."

"Maritime knowledge clusters: A conceptual model and empirical evidence Regional Innovation Systems; Firm; Innovation Networks Maritime Knowledge Clusters (MKCs) are the advanced stage in the evolution path of maritime clusters. Earlier literature however mostly focused on either the characteristics i.e. critical success factors or competitiveness of maritime clusters in general and not on the components of MKCs, their interrelationships, and impact on the performance of constituent firms. This study proposes and tests a conceptual model of Maritime Knowledge Clusters (MKC) and the relations between their components, making use of survey data from 203 shipping professionals located in Singapore. Three theoretical perspectives, namely, relational view, knowledge-based view and resource-based view, have been employed. The results demonstrate that MKCs are substantiated by three critical components, in which the local knowledge cluster can develop global systemic mechanisms, thus further strengthening global linkages. Policy makers must endeavor to create a conducive local cluster environment with maritime firms being located in geographical proximity, and having local networks, knowledge base, and knowledge flows. They form the fundamental foundation for the growth of MKCs. Besides, maritime firms shall optimize the MKC's local knowledge cluster to facilitate their global expansion, which will in turn boost the internationalization of the MKC."

"Spatiotemporal Evolution of Specialized Villages in the Yellow River Basin and Its Influencing Factors Stream Flow; China; Sediment Yield We collected information on 35,353 specialized villages (SVs) from the nine provinces in the Yellow River Basin from 2008 to 2014. Using the nearest neighbor index (NNI), exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), kernel density estimation (KDE), and the geography detector (geodetector) method, we demonstrated the spatiotemporal evolution of these 35,353 SVs and analyzed the influencing factors that triggered change. We arrived at the following conclusion: (1) In the upstream area of the Yellow River Basin, these SVs were fewer in number and more dispersed, and the distribution of these SVs presented in a zonal region. The distribution of SVs in the middle and lower reaches was dense and blocky. The average observation distance of the SVs in the Yellow River Basin decreased from 3.17 km in 2008 to 2.74 km in 2014, and Moranâ€™s I in the county level increased from 0.2640 in 2008 to 0.3449 in 2014, with the degree of concentration increasing. (2) These SV agglomerations in the Yellow River Basin were located in the Guanzhong region in the middle reaches and in the north Shandong province in the downstream region. The agglomeration degree in Guanzhong region was the highest, and the change from 2008 to 2014 grew increasingly stronger. The hotspot concentrated areas were distributed primarily in the downstream region of Shandong Province, the middle reaches of the Weihe Plain, and the Longdong Loess Plateau. The cold-spot concentrated areas were distributed mainly along the borders of Qinghai and Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and Shanxi province. (3) The natural environmental factors always had a great impact on the distribution of SVs, but this influence had decreased. In contrast, the local economic development level also played a very important role in the formation and development of SVs, and the influence of market conditions and technical conditions was gradually strengthening. The driving factors for the agglomeration of SVs in different regions were different and the differences were gradually increasing. The development model of SV was still an effective model to promote Chinaâ€™s Rural Revitalization. In the future, the research on the formation mechanism of SV agglomeration should be strengthened. According to the fact of regional development, the spatial interface theory provides a new path and thought to better study the internal mechanism of SV agglomeration."
"CaT Pin: A Wearable to Detect Loneliness ""The number of lone-person households is increasing around the world.  While loneliness is a significant risk factor for a range of mental and physical health problems, including premature death, it can be hard to identify and offer timely interventions. The importance of word count in language acquisition, IQ and autism in children is well recognised, yet little work has been done on the use of word count as a proxy for loneliness in the elderly. Technology that is co-designed and human centred, particularly that places minimal demand on the individual to learn new procedures or interface with tablets or smart phones, offers a way to address this gap and to reduce loneliness and social isolation in older people.

The CaT Pin (Conversation as Therapy) has been developed by a multidisciplinary team working at the intersection of design, health, and technology. The pin is an outwardly conventional wearable object (e.g., a brooch) enhanced with a sensitive digital microphone and a tiny embedded microprocessor with an integrated Bluetooth low energy (BLE) transceiver. The pin monitors and processes ambient sounds surrounding the wearer in order to identify possible speech sequences within the background noise. The pin does not interpret or recognise actual content, rather it simply identifies and counts words over an interval, a significantly more straightforward problem than full speech recognition, and one that sidesteps privacy issues. The pin can be linked to real time intervention services (e.g., via SMS) and is designed to support further research activities into loneliness assessment.

"Chemical and high-temperature rheological properties of recycled plastics-polymer modified hybrid bitumen Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens This work presents a study on the potential use of recycled linear low-density polyethylene (RLLDPE) as a substitute for virgin polymers to produce hybrid polymer modified bitumen (PMB). To investigate the feasibility of such use, experimental tests focusing on the thermal, chemical and rheological properties of the hybrid PMB were carried out. The hybrid PMB consisted of 3.5% styrene butadiene styrene (SBS) and 2% plastomers; the addition of sulphur, was also evaluated to investigate the chemical cross-linking effect. Commercial plastomers namely ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) were tested as a comparison to RLLDPE; all of them were combined in their hybrid form with SBS. The conventional bitumen test showed the highest softening point and lowest penetration value for RLLDPE-hybrid PMB compared to the others. RLLDPE-hybrid PMB also did not show any significant difference in chemical composition structure compared to virgin LLDPE-hybrid PMB, as well as any relative difference in thermal behaviour. The rheological behaviour of RLLDPE presents an improved stiffness at high temperature and enhanced elasticity at intermediate temperature. In conclusion, RLLDPE is applicable to produce hybrid PMB with superior properties compared to virgin plastomers, at the same time sustainably mitigating waste material disposal."
"Meeting the research(er) and the researched halfway Feminism; Identity Work; Organization Studies How can we investigate something so indeterminate, unpredictable and enormous, as the current Covid-19 pandemic? We apply Karen Barad's relational ontology to illuminate some current dilemmas in research, where different forces, concepts and theories conflict with one another in multiple and complex ways. Barad's views, we argue, may help to address potential dilemmas of accountability, for instance of accounting research(ers) as they research the Covid-19 pandemic. In what Barad calls â€˜intra-actionâ€™, the research apparatus, the researched phenomena, and the research results, constitute a complex system of relatedness. In â€˜intra-actionâ€™ these elements never fully melt into one another, but rather, retain their ontological individuality. The research apparatus creates â€˜realâ€™ effects, but these can only be partially observed and disentangled. Which elements intra-act as the research progresses is the product of so-called â€˜agential cutsâ€™. We have researched the Covid-19 pandemic via what Barad would call a (small-scale) â€˜experimentâ€™. We have focused on air travel and more specifically on American Airlines: a hyperobject or social-economic object so complex and powerful that it cannot be captured in any single definition or analysis. Among others, we take guidance from Albert Camusâ€™ The Plague in our analysis, concluding that AA (as a hyperobject) cannot really meet the research(ers) halfway, as Barad would call for. This is because the mutuality of â€˜intra-actionâ€™, that is demanded is foreclosed. Consequently, while we believe that Barad's views hold great merit for accounting research in the current crisis, we suggest that they raise deeply troubling dilemmas as well."
"Young people's resilience and post-financial crisis television: allegories of economic and social survival Student Mobility; International Students; Youth Labour Market The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007â€“2008 added significant stress and anxieties to the already precarious lives of many young people. Despite this, there is emerging evidence that young people are able to demonstrate remarkable resilience in the midst of economic uncertainties that render the trajectories of their futures uncertain. The pressure to be resilient, to find effective ways to manage the uncertainties inherent to the liberal democracies of the twenty-first century, can be significant. The consequences of failure include deteriorating health and well-being, losses in motivation and hope, economic marginalisation, and ambivalence about the markers of what is means to be an adult. In this paper we spotlight moments in post-GFC television that have drawn on these social narratives, depicting young people's experiences of resilience and uncertainties. We view these moments as more than just television or popular culture. The stories we tell are allegorical, but they are not mere fictions. We focus on the popular television comedy Broad City (2014-) that focusses on the marginalised lifeworlds of trendy, college-educated, young hipsters Ilana and Abbi who are barely getting by in New York City."

"‘Like pouring fuel on a fire’: Perspectives on family and domestic violence among Ethiopian women in Melbourne Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Help-Seeking In this article, we analyse how domestic violence (DV) is understood and experienced among immigrant Ethiopian women in Melbourne, as well as the different conditions that contribute to their experiences of abuse and their responses to it. To do this, we draw on 20 interviews with participants, 7 of whom experienced intimate partner violence. Demonstrating that immigrant Ethiopian women find themselves in a social context with a set of values and understandings of family and DV that differs from their own, we argue that their responses to DV shows their selective acceptance of these values and state interventions. In exploring these themes, we contribute to the discussion about minority women's voices, values and priorities in relation to violence in the migration context. Our findings also highlight the limitations of mainstream approaches to DV, illustrating the extent to which interventions are constructed through reference to western perceptions of individuality and white feminism."

"Reviewing indoor environmental quality of high-rise social housing Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Office Buildings People spend most of their time indoors and majority of this time is spent inside their homes. The vulnerable population, including those with low-income, consider housing as central to their lives. More so for the elderly and sick as they stay inside their residences for even longer times. In Australia, almost 14% of the population live below poverty line. Therefore, social housing for low-income population is key to the national housing sector. In Melbourne, many social housing are single-sided units in high-rise buildings. The indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in these units is generally poor due to building design and characteristics, lack of maintenance and absence of appropriate heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems, causing health-related problems to a vulnerable group. This paper will present a critical review of the IEQ in social housing units in high-rise buildings and its impact on occupant health and comfort. This paper will also explore the interrelationships between the IEQ factors to get a holistic view of their performance focusing on how the design of the building envelope and the provision of windows affect the overall indoor environment of the residential units."
"Gender, political representation and symbolic capital: how some women politicians succeed Political Representation; Quotas; Parliament Increasing womenâ€™s representation in national legislatures has become a priority for international organisations and aid donors in recent decades. Existing studies emphasise structural barriers, whether economic, cultural or religious, that inhibit womenâ€™s participation in the public sphere. Little attention is paid to women who defy these barriers to win election in contexts that are hostile to their presence. This article addresses this gap. Using a Bourdieusian approach, it shows how three senior women leaders from the Pacific Islands translate symbolic capital into political capital. For donors and would-be reformers, the lesson is that institutional interventions must be implemented in ways which allow womenâ€™s symbolic capital to be deployed as political capital, or which enhance womenâ€™s control of various forms of capital. This message is particularly relevant for those interested in the capacity of quotas and other temporary measures to translate descriptive representation into substantive developmental gains."
"The economic dynamics and population change of Australia’s regional cities Regional Development; Leadership; Governance Arrangement Key points This analysis is based on data from the 2011 and 2016 censuses, and does not take into account the redistributions and changes that may have occurred with COVID-19. This report can be seen as providing a baseline for subsequent analysis of the changes that have occurred and continue to occur, identifying the trends and conditions across regional Australiaâ€™s urban centres prior to 2020. Populations in regional urban centres are growing overallâ€”however, this growth is differentiated. Regional urban centre population growth is associated with proximity to major cities, and to coastal locations. Regional urban centre population decline is associated with remoteness and exposure to the resource economy. Capital cities are the main source of migration to regional urban centres, principally coastal and satellite centres with regional-to-regional-centre migration highly self-contained. International migration follows similar distribution. Commuting between regional centres and proximate capital cities increased over 2011â€“2016, indicating increased peri-metropolitan dependency on metropolitan interactions. Employment growth is associated with population growth, particularly for the larger metropolitan satellite and coastal regional citiesâ€”however, this is also associated with lower wage growth due to the employment mix. Health, community service, construction, hospitality and accommodation increased their share of regional employment. Industries associated with agglomeration economies are concentrating in fewer urban centres, while those associated with population services are becoming more dispersed. National economic growth factors appear to expert greater influence on employment growth in regional urban centres, while industry factors exert very limited influence. Regional effects exert greater influence than industry effects, although these are unevenly distributed. In 135 of 198 cases, a regional urban centre exhibits employment growth along with its surrounding functional economic region. For 33 regional urban centres there is positive divergence, while for 25 there is negative divergence. Four regional urban centres are declining within a declining functional economic region. Factors associated with stronger employment growth include employment factors, industry factors (especially those dependent on population growth), while income growth was less associated with employment growth. Population change exerted a strong influence on employment growth, as did human capital factors. Housing market (i.e. price) growth is strongly associated with population growth, while locational factors exhibited low associations. Cluster analysis identified nine distinctive regional urban centre groups: metro-satellites; large regional cities; medium growth cities; regional service centres; ageing population centres; agricultural centres; mining centres; industrial centres, and northern Queensland centres. Policy development should consider the following: Policy and planning measures to address the phenomenon of growth in metropolitan satellite regional urban centres, and the need to ensure coherent population, housing and employment distribution and linkages. Coordinated economic and social development approaches to emerging low-income service economies in coastal regional urban centres. Long-term transition planning to address resource-dependent regional urban centres facing cyclical economic changes based on the labour intensity of construction relative to ongoing economic activity. Opportunities and mechanisms to leverage high-wage economic development from existing regional city industry clusters. Opportunities and mechanisms for regional spatial coordination of fiscal policy to optimise development of high-wage employment in suitable regional urban centres. The study Purpose The contribution of regional urban centres to Australiaâ€™s economic and population growth has been a topic of growing policy interest in the past two decades, as a result of rapid growth in the major cities and concerns for parts of regional Australia that have experienced population decline. Associated with these trends is the distribution of economic activity and employmentâ€”particularly as traditional regional strengths such as agriculture, manufacturing and mining have declined as sources of employment in recent decades. Over the same period, metropolitan areas have prospered because of concentrations of high-skill, high-wage knowledge work, indicating diverging regional fortunes as a result of wider economic trends. The purpose of this research is to investigate patterns and dynamics of population, migration and economic change in Australian regional urban centres 2011â€“2016. The research is principally an empirically focused investigation identifying patterns and dynamic processes of regional change using advanced spatial analytical techniques, but provides an information base that will support future policy development efforts. Inquiry This research is part of a wider AHURI Inquiry into population growth in Australiaâ€™s smaller cities. The Inquiry asks two overarching questions: First, what is the capacity of Australiaâ€™s smaller cities to assist in managing national population growth, including international and national migration? Second, which policy instruments and programs are most likely to redirect population movements to these locations? Study This research investigates two overarching questions related to the Inquiry: How can we differentiate Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres according to economic profile, population trajectory, industry structure and geography? What are the current mobility and settlement patterns of migrants, including those arriving from other parts of Australia and from other nations, across these smaller cities? Three further research questions are posed by this project: 1. How can a typology of smaller cities assist to understand their role in regional, state and national economies? 2. How are Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres differentiated in terms of economic profile, population trajectory and industry structure? 3. What demographic, economic and spatial factors are associated with economic and population growth, and what attributes are associated with better economic performance of regional urban centres? Approach and methods For Research question 1: the project undertakes longitudinal measures of social, demographic and industry change in regional cities 2011â€“2016 using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census data. Next, flow analysis and mapping of migration is applied to identify key migration patterns. Migration flows are used to construct migration regions via modularity analysis. Similar techniques are used to identify journey to work flows from which functional economic regions are constructed. Shift share of employment change and location quotient analysis of employment is used to understand economic change and industry structure. For Research question 2, to understand how Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres are differentiated the project applies hierarchical cluster and discriminant analysis to construct a typology of regional urban centres. This is based on a combination of economic, demographic and geographic factors. These are compiled into summary data and descriptive explanations. For Research question 3: the study applies structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify the relationships between economic, social and demographic factors affecting population change and economic growth in regional urban centres. Key findings Differentiating Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres are heterogeneous in terms of size, location within the Australian continent and settlement structures, level of employment, industrial mix and degree of interaction with regional, metropolitan, national and international economic processes and dynamics. In 2016, there were 198 Australian regional urban centres that had populations greater than 5,000 residents. Most are experiencing population growth. However this growth is differentiated across a range of factors, including: the existing size of the centre location relative to the coast location relative to an existing major capital city. A small number of regional urban centres are experiencing population decline. These centres are largely associated with the resource economy. They are typically positioned in remote locations in Australia. Migration Migration is a major factor in population change within regional urban centres. Migration patterns are clearly structured at the regional scale, with distinct geographies of intra-regional movement that include discernible levels of self-containment. There is a sizeable phenomenon of major city to regional urban centre migration, especially in the south-east of Australia. Beyond the major metropolitan zones, there are larger internally connected migration regions, which often involving movement between adjacent regional urban centres. Some regional urban centres lose and receive populations across long distances. For example, the Northern Territory (NT) operates as a single migration region, partly because of its relatively small population and large scaleâ€”although the volumes of movement are relatively small."

"Improving outcomes for apartment residents and neighbourhoods Housing Supply; Suburban Area; Brisbane â€¢ The number and proportion of Australians living in apartments is increasing. A broad cross-section of Australian society lives in apartments, but lower-income households are over-represented compared to other dwelling types. â€¢ Lower-income apartment residents have a diverse demographic profile. However, there are identifiable lower-income apartment-resident submarkets in Australian cities. â€¢ Lower-income households are disproportionally affected by challenges associated with apartment living, yet most existing research and policy does not consider the impact of living in density for lower-income residents in particular. â€¢ Underpinning the high-density development of Australian cities is a policy orthodoxy that privileges market-led housing delivery and a reduced government role in direct housing provision and management. In this context, policy interventions directed at lower-income apartment residents have been limited. â€¢ Prior research indicates that experiences of apartment living are mediated by the quality and design of the built environment, the nature and quality of service provision, and the demographic profiles and mix of residents at both the building and local area (precinct) scales. â€¢ Research undertaken for this study, focussing on Sydney and Melbourne, demonstrates that the experiences of apartment living for lower-income apartment residents are influenced by planning and infrastructure provision, urban design, building design and management, neighbourhood amenities and facilities, and ongoing place management and community engagement. â€¢ The research identified five main points of tension in delivering high-density buildings and precincts that meet the needs of lower-income residents. There were tensions between the development and operational phases of a new development; at the interface between private buildings and the public domain; over the alignment of infrastructure needs and delivery; at the intersection of local and state government responsibilities; and in meeting the needs of both current and future residents. â€¢ Improving outcomes for lower-income apartment residents will require shifting current priorities in both policy-making and practice. These changes range from relatively simple interventions to proposals requiring significant buy-in from both the private and public sectors. â€¢ Failure to address the needs of lower-income high-density residents risks undermining the prosperity and cohesion of Australian cities in future years."

"A method for testing and rating the acoustic performance of caulking compounds Air; Residential Buildings; Natural Ventilation Inadequate sealing of edge gaps of building partitions (walls, ceilings etc.) can adversely affect the acoustic insulation of a building partition, with consequent loss of amenity to building occupants. Measuring and rating the effectiveness of caulking compounds to protect against such adverse effects is somewhat problematic for a variety of reasons. This paper proposes a method based on ISO 10140-1 Amendment 1 Annex J, and AS/NZS ISO 717.1:2004 to enable laboratory measurement of sound transmission through controlled gaps sealed with the compound under test, and determination of the suitability of such compounds for use in sealing building partitions with specified acoustic insulation requirements. Some examples are provided, from laboratory experiments with test-gaps sealed by different means, demonstrating the outcome of the proposed method in a variety of circumstances."

"Collective Energy Security, Economic Prosperity and Mitigation of Climate Change in South Asia Ganges River; Bangladesh; Road Traffic Noise Affordable access to energy and power is vital for economic and human development, industrialization, and poverty alleviation. Over 20% of South Asia's population does not have access to power, resulting in immense economic growth and prosperity deprivation. The limited endowment of locally available energy resources; varied financial and technological capabilities among South Asian nations greatly restrict their efficient and sustainable power generation and utilization capacity. Containment of energy resources, mismatch of power generation, and user locations due to cross-border non-collaboration have created inefficient uses of limited locally available energy and power. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to review current power generation capacities, available energy resources (conventional and renewable), potential cross-border collaboration in power trade and exchange, and collective investment in sustainable power generation in South Asian nations."

"Poisoning of proton exchange membrane fuel cells by contaminants and impurities: Review of mechanisms, effects, and mitigation strategies Hydrogen; Ionomers; Sulfur Dioxide Durability and performance degradation of PEM fuel cells are amongst the most critical challenges associated with this technology. Air contaminants, fuel impurities, cleansers, and some materials by which fuel cell compartments are made have been proven to have negative effects on PEM fuel cell performance. These materials can get access to anode and cathode catalyst layers, occupy catalyst sites, and deviate principal electrochemical reaction paths. Diverse studies have been conducted to date to advance the understanding of poisoning phenomena and mechanisms through which fuel cell performance is deteriorated. In addition, considerations and strategies such as subsidiary gas injection, filtration, novel tolerant catalyst layers, purification membranes, etc. have been proposed in the literature to mitigate poisoning negative effects or recover poisoned fuel cells. This paper attempts to review suspicious contaminants and impurities, poisoning mechanisms, and mitigation strategies. The present review also provides a summary on what recommended in the literature to increase the tolerance of PEM fuel cells and their catalyst layers to handle poisonous impurities. This review will though highlight research gaps in any of above-mentioned areas and make recommendations on future research contributions to the field."
"Intensification of supercritical water oxidation (ScWO) process for landfill leachate treatment through ion exchange with zeolite Clinoptilolite; Zeolite; Adsorption Over the past few years, supercritical water oxidation (ScWO) has shown great potential for application to landfill leachate treatment, providing substantial organic matter degradation in terms of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC). However, the conversion of ammonia, which is present at high concentrations in leachates, is the rate-limiting step during ScWO and usually requires large amounts of oxidants, the addition of catalysts, or severe operating conditions. Aiming at proposing a treatment system that effectively removes both organic matter and ammonia from leachate, this paper evaluates the intensification of the ScWO process through ion exchange with zeolite. Thus, ScWO was operated under a pressure of 23 MPa at 600 and 700 Â°C, without the addition of oxidants. The zeolite (clinoptilolite) was used without any modification inside a glass column. The ScWO (600 Â°C)/zeolite system removed 90% ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), 100% nitrite (NO2-N), 98% nitrate (NO3-N), color, and turbidity, 81% TOC, and 74% COD, suggesting that this system is a promising alternative for leachate treatment. However, the final NH3-N and COD values were slightly above the limits (20 and 200 mg Lâˆ’1, respectively) stipulated by the Brazilian environmental legislation. These results suggest that further improvements are still required for the application of the intensified ScWO to be feasible. Notably, ammonium-saturated clinoptilolite is amenable for regeneration or can be applied to soil as a slow-release fertilizer."

"Leveraging Beneficial Off-Target Effects of Live-Attenuated Rotavirus Vaccines Heterologous Immunity; Guinea-Bissau; Immunity Following the introduction of live-attenuated rotavirus vaccines in many countries, a notable reduction in deaths and hospitalisations associated with diarrhoea in children <5 years of age has been reported. There is growing evidence to suggest that live-attenuated vaccines also provide protection against other infections beyond the vaccine-targeted pathogens. These so called off-target effects of vaccination have been associated with the tuberculosis vaccine Bacille Calmette GuÃ©rin (BCG), measles, oral polio and recently salmonella vaccines, and are thought to be medi-ated by modified innate and possibly adaptive immunity. Indeed, rotavirus vaccines have been reported to provide greater than expected reductions in acute gastroenteritis caused by other en-teropathogens, that have mostly been attributed to herd protection and prior underestimation of rotavirus disease. Whether rotavirus vaccines also alter the immune system to reduce non targeted gastrointestinal infections has not been studied directly. Here we review the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying off-target effects of vaccines and propose a mechanism by which the live-attenuated neonatal rotavirus vaccine, RV3-BB, could promote protection beyond the targeted pathogen. Finally, we consider how vaccine developers may leverage these properties to improve health outcomes in children, particularly those in low-income countries where disease burden and mortality is disproportionately high relative to developed countries."

"Designing Post COVID-19 Buildings: Approaches for Achieving Healthy Buildings Airborne Infection; COVID-19; Operating Rooms The COVID-19 pandemic forced the accessibility, social gathering, lifestyle, and working environment to be changed to reduce the infection. Coronavirus spreads between people in several different ways. Small liquid particles (aerosols, respiratory droplets) from an infected person are transmitted through air and surfaces that are in contact with humans. Reducing transmission through modified heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and building design are potential solutions. A comprehensive review of the engineering control preventive measures to mitigate COVID-19 spread, healthy building design, and material was carried out. The current state-of-the-art engineering control preventive measures presented include ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), bipolar ionization, vertical gardening, and indoor plants. They have potential to improve the indoor air quality. In addition, this article presents building design with materials (e.g., copper alloys, anti-microbial paintings) and smart technologies (e.g., automation, voice control, and artificial intelligence-based facial recognition) to mitigate the infections of communicable diseases."

"Birth and Neonatal Transition in the Guinea Pig: Experimental Approaches to Prevent Preterm Birth and Protect the Premature Fetus Inflammation; Premature Obstetric Labor; Extraembryonic Membranes The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) displays many features of gestational physiology that makes it the most translationally relevant rodent species. Progesterone production undergoes a luteal to placental shift as in human pregnancy with levels rising during gestation and with labor and delivery occurring without a precipitous decline in maternal progesterone levels. In contrast to other laboratory rodents, labor in guinea pigs is triggered by a functional progesterone withdrawal, which involves the loss of uterine sensitivity to progesterone like in women. In both species the amnion membrane is a major source of labor-inducing prostaglandins, which promote functional progesterone withdrawal by modifying myometrial progesterone receptor expression. These similar features appear to result from convergent evolution rather than closer evolutionally relationship to primates compared to other rodents. Nevertheless, the similarities in the production, metabolism and actions of progesterone and prostaglandins allow information gained in pregnant guinea pigs to be extended to pregnant women with confidence. This includes exploring the effects of pregnancy complications including growth restriction and the mechanisms by which stressful conditions increase the incidence of preterm labor. The relatively long gestation of the guinea pig and the maturity of the pups at birth particularly in brain development means that a greater proportion of brain development happens in utero. This allows adverse intrauterine conditions to make a sustained impact on the developing brain like in compromised human pregnancies. In addition, the brain is exposed to a protective neurosteroid environment in utero, which has been suggested to promote development in the guinea pig and the human. Moreover, in utero stresses that have been shown to adversely affect long term neurobehavioral outcomes in clinical studies, can be modeled successfully in guinea pigs. Overall, these parallels to the human have led to increasing interest in the guinea pig for translational studies of treatments and therapies that potentially improve outcomes following adverse events in pregnancy and after preterm birth."

"Exploring a new incubation model for FinTechs: Regulatory sandboxes Business Development; Science Parks; Incubators Research on incubation models indicates that incubators and accelerators are crucial catalysts for the development of start-ups. To facilitate start-ups in financial markets, several regulatory authorities have adopted a new incubation model called a â€˜regulatory sandboxâ€™. Regulatory sandboxes enable eligible applicants to test their technology-enabled financial solutions for a certain period of time (subject to conditions the regulator imposes). As such, these instruments allow innovation while preventing severe instability in financial markets caused by systemic risk. Despite their importance, management research has devoted little attention to studying how sandboxes operate as a new incubation model. In our abductive study, we adopt the activity system framework and a qualitative analysis approach to investigate the activities of five leading sandboxes and compare them with the activities of other incubation models. The data analysis yielded an activity model with three design elements (achieving membership, participating and detaching) and one design theme (improving connectedness). Thus, sandboxes are characterized by providing regulatory guidance and facilitating access to testing across international jurisdictions, distinguishing them from both generic and specialized incubation models. Our primary contribution to the incubation literature is extending the knowledge of a unique incubation model through a set of theoretical propositions."
"The impact of immigration on housing prices in Australia Labour Market Effects; Emigration And Immigration; Immigration Policy In recent years, Australia has experienced high rates of immigration. We investigate the effect that this has had on housing prices at the postcode level. The endogeneity of immigrant inflows is accounted for using the Bartik shift-share approach. Using data from the censuses in 2006, 2011, and 2016, we find that an immigrant inflow of 1% of a postcode's population raises housing prices by around 0.9% per year. As a result, Australian housing prices would have been around 1.1% lower per annum had there been no immigration. The size of this effect is broadly consistent with that found for other countries. The effects of immigration on housing prices were larger in the more recent part of the period examined and strongest in the states of New South Wales and Victoria, and the cities of Melbourne and Adelaide. Chinese and Indian immigrant groups are shown to have a strong positive influence on prices."
"Intimate tablets: digital advocacy and post-feminist pharmaceuticals Foreign Language Education; Medical Discourse; Public Issues Since the enormous commercial success of Viagra, launched by Pfizer in 1998, large pharmaceutical conglomerates have sought to produce an analogous drug for women with low sexual desire. On August 18 2015, Sprout Pharmaceuticals obtained approval from the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) for flibanserin, now marketed as Addyi. In the lead-up to the approval of Addyi, campaigns supporting the production of the drug were deployed through an extensive use of social and digital media platforms including Facebook and Twitter, which mobilised discourses of post-feminism to reconfigure narratives of intimacy to lobby the FDA. The lobbying for the approval of the tablet represents a unique instance of consumers reproducing discourses of medicalisation in order to demand gender equality. It strategically combines feminist rhetoric and digital media platforms to disseminate and coordinate such demands. The rhetoric of post-feminism constitutes both a reproduction of discourses of medicalisation and a challenge to medical orthodoxy. The success of the campaigns exemplifies a turn in the pharmaceutical industry where potential consumers are also producers of medical products, no longer passive but active agents in the commodification of pharmaceutical intimacy and the management of sexual desire."

"Influence of human activities on broad-scale estuarine-marine habitats using omics-based approaches applied to marine sediments Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus Rapid urban expansion and increased human activities have led to the progressive deterioration of many marine ecosystems. The diverse microbial communities that inhabit these ecosystems are believed to influence large-scale geochemical processes and, as such, analyzing their composition and functional metabolism can be a means to assessing an ecosystemâ€™s resilience to physical and chemical perturbations, or at the very least provide baseline information and insight into future research needs. Here we show the utilization of organic and inorganic contaminant screening coupled with metabolomics and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess the microbial community structure of marine sediments and their functional metabolic output. The sediments collected from Moreton Bay (Queensland, Australia) contained low levels of organic and inorganic contaminants, typically below guideline levels. The sequencing dataset suggest that sulfur and nitrite reduction, dehalogenation, ammonia oxidation, and xylan degradation were the major metabolic functions. The community metabolites suggest a level of functional homogeneity down the 40-cm core depth sampled, with sediment habitat identified as a significant driver for metabolic differences. The communities present in river and sandy channel samples were found to be the most active, with the river habitats likely to be dominated by photoheterotrophs that utilized carbohydrates, fatty acids and alcohols as well as reduce nitrates to release atmospheric nitrogen and oxidize sulfur. Bioturbated mud habitats showed overlapping faunal activity between riverine and sandy ecosystems. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria and lignin-degrading bacteria were most abundant in the sandy channel and bioturbated mud, respectively. The use of omics-based approaches provide greater insight into the functional metabolism of these impacted habitats, extending beyond discrete monitoring to encompassing whole community profiling that represents true phenotypical outputs. Ongoing omics-based monitoring that focuses on more targeted pathway analyses is recommended in order to quantify the flux changes within these systems and establish variations from these baseline measurements."
"A Community Detection Method Based on the Subspace Similarity of Nodes in Complex Networks Community Detection; Complex Network; Modularity Many real-world networks have a topological structure characterized by cohesive groups of vertices. Community detection aims at identifying such groups and plays a critical role in network science. Till now, many community detection methods have been developed in the literature. Most of them require to know the number of communities and the low accuracy in the complex networks are the shortcomings of most of these methods. To tackle these issues in this paper, a novel community detection method called CDNSS is proposed. The proposed method is based on the nodes subspace similarity and includes two main phases; seeding and expansion. In the first phase, seeds are identified using the potential distribution in the local and global similarity space. To compute the similarity between each pair, a specific centrality measure by considering the sparse linear coding and self-expressiveness ability of nodes. Then, the nodes with best focal state are discovered which guarantees the stability of solutions. In the expansion phase, a greedy strategy is used to assign the unlabeled nods to the relevant focal regions. The results of the experiments performed on several real-world and synthetic networks confirm the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with well-known and state-of-the-art community detection methods."
"Narcissism, political tenure, financial indicators and the effectiveness of environmental regulation Impression Management; Annual Reports; Chief Executive Officer This article explores the factors that determine the effectiveness of environmental regulation in the United States and Australia. Unlike prior literature, in which lagging performance measures (such as carbon emissions) are used, we use financial data to develop effectiveness scores and identify the determinants of effectiveness, including narcissistic behaviour, tenure of political leaders and financial indicators. Consistent with the emerging literature on environmental finance, we find that abnormal returns are associated with environmental regulation and that effectiveness is adversely affected when narcissistic leaders are in power. Our results remain robust when we control for various event windows and models."
"Microdiamond-doped lead-silicate glass optical fibre for remote magnetometry Color Centers; Nitrogen; Nanodiamonds We demonstrate fabrication and characterizations of intrinsically magneto-sensitive fiber with potential applications as a high-efficiency remote magnetic field sensing platform. The fibre was fabricated using lead-silicate glass and the rod-intube fibre drawing technique. The thin glass rod of âˆ¼1 mm diameter was first coated with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centreenriched diamond particles of âˆ¼1 Î¼m diameter, and subsequently inserted into the glass outer tube. This rod-in-Tube assembly was drawn down to fibre, with the diamond particles distributed at the fused interface between rod and tube. We experimentally coupled 532 nm continuous-wave laser into a 30-cm-length fibre piece from the fibre endface, and examined the photoluminescence (PL) properties of the fibre from both the side of the fibre and the output end of the fibre. PL mapping results showed that the glass-embedded NV emitters showed bright and photostable fluorescence, demonstrating characteristic NV centre zero phonon line emission. Moreover, the mapping result obtained at the output end of fibre indicated that the transmitted NV fluorescence was coupled into the propagation modes of the fibre. By using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) from the NV ensemble along the fibre, we demonstrate detection of local magnetic fields via longitudinal excitation and side collection. Based on the current light transmission and collection configuration, the hybrid diamond-glass optical fibre sensor demonstrated a shot noise-limited DC magnetic field sensitivity of 3.7 Î¼T/âˆšHz at room temperature. Our results open the possibility of robust, field-deployable fibre optical magnetometry."

"Flexible employment policies, temporal control and health promoting practices: A qualitative study in two Australian worksites Work-Family Conflict; Work-Life Balance; Personnel For four decades, theories of job demand-control have proposed that higher occupational status groups have lower health risks due to the stress accompanying jobs featuring high demands but high control. This research examines whether Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) can improve the health prospects of a range of workers by giving greater control over work time arrangements. Our setting is Australia, where FWAs were introduced in 2009. In line with these early studies alongside studies of work-life balance, we expected to observe that workers with access to control over daily work times could better control the activities outside of work that influence chronic disease. Using a practice sociology approach, we compared the accounts of twenty-eight workers in blue and white collar industries with differing degrees of work time flexibility. The findings do not contradict early theories describing occupational differences of job demand-control dynamics and their relationship to health risks. However, this study suggests that a) time demands and strains have increased for a broad sweep of workers since the 1980s, b) the greater control of higher occupational status groups has been eroded by the high performance movement, which has attracted less scrutiny than FWAs, and c) more workers are forced to adapt their daily lives, including their approach to health, to accommodate their job demands. Job insecurity further impedes preventative health practices adoption. What might appear to be worker-controlled flexibility can-under the pressures of job insecurity and performance expectations without time limits-transform into health-eroding unpredictability. The answer however is not greater flexibility in the absence of limits on the well-documented precursors of work stress: long hours, job insecurity and intensity-related exhaustion. While there have been welcome developments in job demand-control-health conceptualizations, they typically ignore the out-of-work temporal demands that workers face and which compound on-the-job demands. Redesign of the temporalities of working life within worksites need to be accompanied by society-level policies which address caring responsibilities, gender equality as well as broad labour market conditions."
"Characteristics of Pedestrians in Bangladesh Who Did Not Receive Public Education on Road Safety Taxis; Rapid Transit Systems; Public Transport The safety of pedestrians, such as workers who largely walk to and from work, has not been given sufficient attention, especially in the area of traffic safety in developing countries, including Bangladesh. Although the National Road Safety Strategy has a very strong emphasis on road safety education and publicity campaigns, the road safety knowledge may not have reached these vulnerable road users who most needed them. Moreover, little is known about the penetration rate of these campaigns and who have benefited or not benefited from them. On the other hand, the developing country, like Bangladesh, is heavily dependent on its Readymade Garment (RMG) workers for earning foreign currency, and walking is one of the major mode of transports of those workers. The objective of this study is to identify those who are not reach by the safety education. Results from a survey of 1020 RMG workers around Dhaka identified several socioeconomic, demographic, travel characteristics and accident experience that affect the most vulnerable segments who are left out of the system. The findings of this study would help the policy makers to arrange necessary road safety education for the most vulnerable cohorts of pedestrians to encourage the continued use of this sustainable mode of commute."
"Effect of Star Rating Improvement of Residential Buildings on Life Cycle Environmental Impacts and Costs Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building A diagnostic framework is proposed to assess the influence of star rating improvement for residential buildings on life cycle environmental impacts and life cycle costs (LCEI and LCC) using life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing methods, respectively, on all life cycle phases (i.e., construction, operation, maintenance, and disposal). A reference house was modified on the basis of six alternative designs to deliver a particular star rating in order to demonstrate the analysis framework. Two LCIA methods (i.e., material flows/add masses and eco-indicator 99 Australian substances) were used to estimate ten LCEI indicators under two categories: seven from problem-oriented (i.e., raw material, air emission, water emission, eco-toxicity, acidification/eutrophication potential, ozone depletion, and climate change) and three from damage-oriented (i.e., resource depletion, ecosystem quality, and effect on human health) categories. The three damage-oriented indicators were combined to evaluate environmental and economic wellbeing on a single eco-point basis. All these combinations of impact indicators can offer three lines of analytical options along with star rating: problem-oriented, damage-oriented, and a variety of problem and damage-oriented LCEIs with LCCs. Hence, the optimum house selection is-based not only on cost or star rating, but also on LCEIs."

"Patterns of historical and future urban expansion in Nepal Sleuths; Cellular Automaton Model; Urbanization Globally, urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented rate at the cost of agricultural and forested lands in peri-urban areas fringing larger cities. Such land-cover change generally entails negative implications for societal and environmental sustainability, particularly in South Asia, where high demographic growth and poor land-use planning combine. Analyzing historical land-use change and predicting the future trends concerning urban expansion may support more effective land-use planning and sustainable outcomes. For Nepal's Tarai region-a populous area experiencing land-use change due to urbanization and other factors-we draw on Landsat satellite imagery to analyze historical land-use change focusing on urban expansion during 1989-2016 and predict urban expansion by 2026 and 2036 using artificial neural network (ANN) and Markov chain (MC) spatial models based on historical trends. Urban cover quadrupled since 1989, expanding by 256 km2 (460%), largely as small scattered settlements. This expansion was almost entirely at the expense of agricultural conversion (249 km2). After 2016, urban expansion is predicted to increase linearly by a further 199 km2 by 2026 and by another 165 km2 by 2036, almost all at the expense of agricultural cover. Such unplanned loss of prime agricultural lands in Nepal's fertile Tarai region is of serious concern for food-insecure countries like Nepal."

Ability to assess and compare the environmental impacts from different construction activities can aid the process of minimising emissions at different building construction processes. The study presents a comparative impact assessment methodology to evaluate environmental impacts at different activities during the building construction stage. Significant impact related construction activities for five major impact categories namely global warming potential (GWP 100), acidification potential (AP), Eutrophication potential (EP), Photochemical oxidation formation potential (POFP) and Human toxicity potential (HTP) are compared from the global, regional and local perspectives. A case study of a residential building in Australia is used to demonstrate the application of the functions of the developed method. The results of the case study indicated that the method can be effectively used to compare environmental impacts of different construction activities at different geographical perspectives considered. The method can be used by designers and contractors in comparing impacts of various construction activities to identify the most emission effective construction processes."
"Many IUCN red list species have names that evoke negative emotions Sentiment Classification; Data Mining; Product Review Species common names underpin communication between researchers, stakeholders and the public. Changing unappealing (e.g., rough-skinned horned toad), misleading (e.g., lesser bird of paradise) or even immemorable (e.g., little grassbird) species names could be an effective, and inexpensive, way to improve engagement with and support for threatened species. We use two sentiment lexicons to analyze the common names of 26,794 IUCN Red List animal species to understand which words drive sentiment in species names. Words driving common name sentiment varied across taxonomic class and threat status; highly frequent words associated with human emotions included anger, fear, disgust, and joy. We identified keywords for future targeted research on strategic name changes (e.g., greater, golden, least, lesser, false). This article provides essential grounding for future species common name research and improving public engagement with threatened species."
"Anisotropy of 3d columnar coatings in mid-infrared spectral range Thin Films; Films; Birefringent Coatings Polarisation analysis in the mid-infrared fingerprint region was carried out on thin (âˆ¼1 Âµm) Si and SiO2 films evaporated via glancing angle deposition (GLAD) method at 70â—¦ to the normal. Synchrotron-based infrared microspectroscopic measurements were carried out on the Infrared Microspectroscopy (IRM) beamline at Australian Synchrotron. Specific absorption bands, particularly Si-O-Si stretching vibration, was found to follow the angular dependence of âˆ¼cos2 Î¸, consistent with the absorption anisotropy. This unexpected anisotropy stems from the enhanced absorption in nano-crevices, which have orientation following the cos2 Î¸ angular dependence as revealed by Fourier transforming the image of the surface of 3D columnar films and numerical modeling of light field enhancement by sub-wavelength nano-crevices."

"Ethnic diversity and transport poverty Public Transport; Accessibility; Transit Transport poverty is a growing concern in many developed countries. However, research on the determinants of transport poverty is relatively scant. We contribute to the debate on the determinants of transport poverty by presenting the first study to empirically examine the effects of ethnic diversity on transport poverty. Using 12 waves of longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, covering the period 2005â€“2016, we find a positive association between ethnic diversity and transport poverty. This result is robust to endogeneity, alternative ways of measuring ethnic diversity and transport poverty. We show that trust is an important channel through which ethnic diversity influences transport poverty. Thus, policies aimed at fostering tolerance, trust and inclusion in diverse communities are important to mitigate the negative effects of ethnic diversity on desirable socioeconomic outcomes."
"Climate change impacts on rice-based livelihood vulnerability in the lower Vietnamese Mekong Delta: Empirical evidence from Can Tho City and Tra Vinh Province Mekong River; Dams; Hydropower This paper assesses the livelihood vulnerability and adaptive capacity of rice-based farmers in the lower Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) under the impact of climate change and environmental pressures. We interviewed 600 rice farmers in 19 communes spanning six districts of Can Tho City (middle delta) and Tra Vinh Province (coastal delta). For our analyses, we employed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) framework and the LVI approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (LVIâ€“IPCC). Results indicate that both study areas are vulnerable to climate change and environmental pressures, but the potential threat is greater in the coastal province. Farmers there have responded to climate change and environmental pressures by increasing production inputs, scaling up production areas and transforming cropping patterns, though with little investment in new equipment. Yet, their livelihoods from rice cultivation, and agricultural production in general, remain unsustainable under climate change, which is a matter of concern. This study provides empirical evidence of the vulnerability factors that most undermine farmersâ€™ adaptive capacity and livelihood sustainability in the study areas. This will help local authorities in providing timely support to agricultural production management."

"Beyond the luxury effect: Individual and structural drivers lead to ‘urban forest inequity’ in public street trees in Melbourne, Australia Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Urban trees are increasingly being used to help cities adapt to climate change, improve health and wellbeing, and promote biodiversity. Yet these benefits are distributed unequally, mirroring the uneven distribution of the urban forest in many cities. Contrasting theories have been proposed to explain these observed patterns that focus either on the economic wherewithal of individuals (the â€˜luxury effectâ€™), or the outcome of structural factors such as municipal decision-making processes. Here, we explore patterns across 10 municipal authorities in greater Melbourne, Australia to compare the relative importance of these competing mechanisms. We show that both individual and structural processes are both major determinants of the density and diversity of trees in this large Australian city. Interestingly, education level was strongly related to tree density, while household income was negatively related to tree density and diversity in some municipalities. The luxury effect was not able to adequately explain the patterns observed in Melbourne. This finding has important implications for the planning and management of urban forests and the equitable distribution of the benefits they provide, in the context of the rapid expansion of urban populations across the globe. To counteract inequity, local municipalities must acknowledge and deliberately overcome internal biases that favour the provision of street trees to more advantaged sections of the community."
"Waking up too early – the consequences of preterm birth on sleep development Outcome; Prematurity; Encephalomalacia Good quality sleep of sufficient duration is vital for optimal physiological function and our health. Sleep deprivation is associated with impaired neurocognitive function and emotional control, and increases the risk for cardiometabolic diseases, obesity and cancer. Sleep develops during fetal life with the emergence of a recognisable pattern of sleep states in the preterm fetus associated with the development, maturation and connectivity within neural networks in the brain. Despite the physiological importance of sleep, surprisingly little is known about how sleep develops in individuals born preterm. Globally, an estimated 15 million babies are born preterm (<37 weeks gestation) each year, and these babies are at significant risk of neural injury and impaired brain development. This review discusses how sleep develops during fetal and neonatal life, how preterm birth impacts on sleep development to adulthood, and the factors which may contribute to impaired brain and sleep development, leading to altered neurocognitive, behavioural and motor capabilities in the infant and child. Going forward, the challenge is to identify specific risk factors for impaired sleep development in preterm babies to allow for the design of interventions that will improve the quality and quantity of sleep throughout life.

"Exposure to cigarette smoke precipitates simple hepatosteatosis to NASH in high-fat diet fed mice by inducing oxidative stress Fatty Liver; Lipotoxicity; High Fat Diet Consumption of diet rich in fat and cigarette smoking (CS) are independent risk factors of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and they often occur together in some populations. The present study investigated the mechanisms of high-fat diet (HFD) and CS, individually and in combination, on the pathogenesis of NASH in mice. C57BL/6 male mice were subjected to either a low-fat chow (CH) or HFD with or without mainstream CS-exposure (4 cigarettes/day, 5 days/ week for 14 weeks). HFD alone caused hepatosteatosis (2.5-fold increase in TG content) and a significant increase in 3-nitrotyrisine (by âˆ¼40-fold) but without an indication of liver injury, inflammation or fibrosis. CS alone in CH-fed mice increased in TnfÎ± expression and macrophage infiltration by 2-fold and relatively less increase in 3-nitrotyrosine (18-fold). Combination of HFD and CS precipitated hepatosteatosis to NASH reflected by exacerbated makers of liver inflammation and fibrosis which were associated with much severe liver oxidative stress (90-fold increase in 3-nitrotyrisine along with 6-fold increase in carbonylated proteins and 56% increase in lipid oxidations). Further studies were performed to administer the antioxidant tempol to CS exposed HFD mice and the results showed that the inhibition of liver oxidative stress prevented inflammatory and fibrotic changes in liver despite persisting hepatosteatosis. Our findings suggest that oxidative stress is a key mechanism underlying CS-promoted progression of simple hepatosteatosis to NASH. Targeting hepatic oxidative stress may be a viable strategy in halting the progression of metabolic associated fatty liver disease."
"ISOL-AID, ART and wellbeing: Posthuman community amid COVID-19 Art; Prescribing; Dementia In the isolating times of COVID-19, digital live streaming has been a key means through which artists connect with their audiences/community and audience members access live art and music. With performances mediated through digital live stream, artists and audience members alike are experimenting with strategies for connection, and indeed, for survival. This reconfiguration of sociality, of the liveness of community, threatens to endure beyond the pandemic. The Instagram Live music festival â€˜Isol-AIDâ€™, which we examine as a case study in this chapter, prompts a discussion around arts accessibility as a measure of public health and wellbeing. Building on literature about social prescribing, we suggest that Instagram Live engages therapeutic forms of arts practice, and as such, could be offered as a new digital health resource. Using a critical posthumanist perspective, we think-through Instagram Live and streamed performance as posthuman assemblages to highlight the importance of non-human actants (such as phones, wifi, colours, sounds) in the production of the feeling of community, which is a social determinant of health. These creative methods of expression and connection encourage discussion around the importance of the arts in community health and wellbeing, a conversation that could not be more relevant than in the socially isolated world that is, this global pandemic."

"Mitigating spatial conflict of land use for sustainable wetlands landscape in Li-Xia-river region of central Jiangsu, China Ecosystem Health; China; Ecological Civilisation Li-Xia-river Wetlands make up the biggest freshwater marsh in East China. Over the last decades, social and economic developments have dramatically altered the natural wetlands landscape. Mitigating land use conflict is beneficial to protect wetlands, maintain ecosystem services, and coordinate local socioeconomic development. This study employed multi-source data and GIS-based approaches to construct a composite index model with the purpose of quantitatively evaluating the intensity of land use conflict in Li-Xia-river Wetlands from 1978 to 2018. The results showed that the percentage of the wetlandsâ€™ area declined from 20.3% to 15.6%, with an overall reduction rate of 23.2%. The mean index of land use conflict increased from 0.15 to 0.35, which suggests that the conflict intensity changed from â€œno conflictâ€ to â€œmild conflict.â€ The number of severe conflict units increased by about 25 times. A conspicuous spatial variation of land use conflict was observed across different periods, although taking land for agricultural activities was the overriding reason for wetlands reduction. However, in recent years, urban sprawl has posed the greatest threat to Li-Xia-river Wetlands. Coordinating land use conflict and formulating a practical strategy are the initial imperative steps to mitigate the threat to wetlands."

"Pilot Study into the Design of Toileting Device for Women Wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Improvement of Health and Wellbeing One of the challenges that appears to be relevant to a number of industries where female workers are required to wear PPE and other similar specialized gear, as well as to work for prolonged periods of time in situations that are remote or are without toilet facilities, is the ability to comfortably, safely and discretely urinate without significant disrobing and disarming. In the present situation, a women’s inability to toilet as needed, can lead them to making decisions to significantly decrease their fluid intake for prolonged periods of time and to being continuously conscious about their condition. This potentially could lead to the decrease in mental and health wellbeing, cognitive ability, dehydration, susceptibility to urinary tract infections and other health hazards, such as bladder stones and reduced kidney function, as well as to reduction in safety and productivity. 
The present activity will compliment the medical study in the field of human centred design by closely looking into """"state of the art"""" devices that are currently available and identifying the paths forward in terms of a wearable design solution. We will conduct a number of focus groups with women in the target group to understand more deeply their human experience and ideal solutions (CHEAN will be applied for in advance of this stage).

"How do housing and labour markets affect individual homelessness? Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease We examine the impact of housing and labour market conditions on individual risks of homelessness. Our innovation is a focus on homelessness entries, although findings from jointly estimated homelessness entry and exit probit equations are reported. Risky behaviours and life experiences such as regular use of drugs, the experience of violence and biographies of acute disadvantage lead to a higher risk of becoming homeless. Public housing is a strong protective factor. We find clear evidence that for certain subgroups it is being the â€˜wrong person in the wrong placeâ€™ that matters most when considering risks of entering homelessness. Indigenous Australians, for example, are no more likely to become homeless than other vulnerable groups holding housing and labour market conditions constant. However, tighter housing markets and weaker labour markets expose Indigenous Australians to significantly higher risks of entering homelessness."

"Research on agricultural cooperation potential between china and cee countries based on resource complementarity Alliance Portfolios; Firm; Open Innovation Central and East European (CEE) countries are attractive among emerging markets due to a combination of factors such as economic growth and market potential. Although the CEE countries as a whole have a very high degree of connectivity, each country has different market opportunities and external environment, so agricultural enterprises wanting to enter the CEE market must take into account the diverse and complex resource base of CEE countries. In the light of economic globalization, China and CEE countries face mutual opportunities and challenges, and it is necessary to strengthen agricultural cooperation. The potential of agricultural investment cooperation between China and CEE countries is the basis for multinational enterprises to allocate resources and implement internationalization strategies rationally. The purpose of this paper is to analyze theagricultural cooperation potential between China and CEE countries in the perspective of resource complementarity, with a selection of macro data related to agricultural capacity from 2009â€“2018. In particular, this study examines the differences and complementarities between China and CEE countries in terms of agricultural resource conditions and product output and trade; by constructing an agricultural cooperation potential evaluation model, the entropy value method is applied to predict and evaluate the potential characteristics of agricultural cooperation between China and CEE countries in 2021â€“2025. The research results show that the current intermittent and episodic nature of agricultural cooperation between China and CEE countries does not match the high or medium-high level of complementarity between agricultural production factors. Thus, agricultural enterprises can utiliza such considerable cooperation potential based on the resource complementarity to develop internationalization strategies and overseas investment."

"Leading Diverse Workforces: Perspectives from Managers and Employers about Dyslexic Employees in Australian Workplaces Students With Disabilities; Dyslexia; Inclusive Education Background: Dyslexia is a specific learning disability affecting around 1 in 10 Australian adults. It presents unique challenges for employees in the workforce, yet community and workplace awareness of the challenges of dyslexia is limited. The aim of this preliminary research was to explore the experiences and perspectives of Australian employers and managers responsible for supervising employees with dyslexia in the workplace. Materials and Methods: Using a qualitative research design, we conducted in-depth interviews with four managers who had current or previous experience managing employees with dyslexia. We used a deductive approach to analyse the data and categorise responses to the study questions. Results: Participant responses indicated that there is a lack of awareness and understanding of dyslexia within Australian workplaces. Participants identified challenges facing employees with dyslexia in the workplace including, differing personal levels of confidence and comfort in disclosing disability; the possibility of discrimination, and a lack of inclusive organisational practices and processes. Suggestions for ways to improve workplaces for dyslexic employees included: additional support for leaders and managers to drive inclusive leadership, and additional training for leaders and managers on how to best support employees with dyslexia. Conclusions: While only a small sample size, this study indicates that further research is needed to better understand the working environment of Australian leaders and managers. It appears that leaders and mangers need skills and knowledge to better support employees with dyslexia and in doing so create more inclusive workplaces."

"Integrated Kalina cycle in a combined polymer membrane fuel cell and evacuated heat pipe collector for a new power generation system Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC); Fuel Cell; DC-DC Converter This paper presents the integration of the Kalina cycle process in a combined polymer membrane fuel cell and evacuated heat pipe collector for improvement of power generation efficiency. The proposed system is evaluated from thermodynamic, environmental, and exergoeconomic perspectives, and the effect of key system parameters are investigated. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the proposed system in the given conditions are improved by 13.12% and 10.35%, respectively compared to an independent fuel cell. The system's product unit cost of the system and output power in this condition are 136.1 $/GJ and 145.1 kW. The system also prevents the production of 116.1 kg/hr of carbon dioxide under these conditions. The analysis of system parameters shows a direct relationship between increased current density, temperature, and operating pressure of the fuel cell and decreased energy and exergy efficiencies. On the other hand, the total product unit cost increases as these parameters increase. The system assessment shows there is a suitable turbine inlet pressure to achieve optimal efficiency, the lowest unit price for the product, and maximum CO2 emission reduction. Although solar collectors reduce the system's energy efficiency, they increase the exergy efficiency and reduce the cost per unit of the total product."

To assess the impact of scientific and technical training on midwives' abilities in collecting and recording the key performance indicators for fetal growth chart development in limited-resource settings. Methods. A descriptive design was used to describe midwives' abilities in timely collecting and recording the minimum data required to estimate fetal weight and develop fetal growth chart. The study was conducted among 19 urban and rural midwives in South Kalimantan, Indonesia, between April 2016 and October 2017. The training provided access to antenatal care information on 4,946 women (retrospective cohort study) and 381 women (prospective cohort study). Results. The average amount of recorded antenatal care data on the key performance indicators of fetal growth assessment has been significantly improved (from 33.4% to 89.1%, p-value < 0.0005) through scientific and technical training. Conclusions. Scientific knowledge and technical abilities have enabled midwives to timely record routine data of the key performance indicators for fetal growth surveillance. Access to this information is vital during different stages of pregnancy. The information can be utilised as evidence-based guidelines to assess fetal risks through fetal weight estimation and to develop fetal growth chart that is currently not available in Indonesian primary healthcare systems."

"Influence of heat treatments on microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti-26Nb alloy elaborated in situ by laser additive manufacturing with Ti and Nb mixed powder Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) In the present work, a Ti-26Nb alloy was elaborated in situ by laser additive manufacturing (LAM) with Ti and Nb mixed powders. The alloys were annealed at temperatures ranging from 650 Â°C to 925 Â°C, and the effects of the annealing temperature on the microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated. It has been found that the microstructure of the as-deposited alloy obtained in the present conditions is characterized by columnar prior Î² grains with a relatively strong < 001 > fiber texture in the build direction. The as-deposited alloy exhibits extremely high strength, and its ultimate tensile strength and yield strength are about 799 MPa and 768 MPa, respectively. The annealing temperature has significant effects on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloys. Annealing treatment can promote the dissolution of unmelted Nb particles and eliminate the micro-segregation of Nb at the elliptical-shaped grain boundaries, while increasing the grain size of the alloy. With an increase in annealing temperature, the strength of the alloy decreases but the ductility increases. The alloy annealed at 850 Â°C exhibits a balance of strength and ductility."

Steel production is critical to the support of global economic development and employs sophisticated, mature and highly-optimised blast furnace technology, but is nevertheless responsible for 7â€“9% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Global net-zero pledges mean that the industry cannot proceed with only incremental improvements, and must anticipate major changes to its core processes, or else depend on negative emissions technologies that may cost even more to implement. Transition scenarios in this paper highlight the rate at which â€˜green steelâ€™ technologies would need to be deployed to meet sectoral net-zero targets. The paper shows the co-location of Australia's major iron ore deposits with excellent renewable energy resources, highlighting a potential advantage for local large-scale development of this industry. Deploying the huge renewable energy infrastructure required would lead to potential challenges for global materials supply chains. For Australia to find a strong and ongoing role in this industry, there it will need to consider long-sighted environmental and industrial policies, including R&D funding, project financing and (low-)emissions certification."

"The role of packaging in Australian fresh food waste prevention and nutrition retention The research aims to examine and understand the role that packaging fulfils in minimising food waste and maximising quality control of fresh produce and the associated benefits. Therefore the project is concerned with the following:
? Demonstrating the life cycle of 10 fresh produce items, both with and without packaging. Specifically, this would include projecting/estimating by how many days the shelf life of a fresh produce item is extended due to packaging and the shelf life of the product without packaging i.e. sold loose
? Demonstrating how the nutritional elements of the fresh produce item are protected due to the use of packaging and how the nutritional elements of the fresh produce item are degraded/reduced due to no packaging
? Estimating (if practical) the volume of product diverted from landfill as a result of packaging being used and the volume of product going to landfill as a result of no packaging.

"Gut like Hydrogel Based Perfusion Bioreactor to Engineer Stable Gut Microbial Composition for Treating Gut Infections (Biomebank) Faecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT): FMT involves collecting faeces from a heathy individual and transplanting it into the bowel of a patient with disease with the aim of treating that disease. FMT is a potentially life-saving treatment for Clostridioides difficile infection and can induce remission in other diseases such as ulcerative colitis. FMT requires stool to be collected from heathy volunteer who has been thoroughly screened with medical interview, examination and blood and stool testing prior to processing. 
• Problems with FMT: FMT is harvested from human donors with very different gut bacteria profiles and therefore it is not a standardised product. This makes therapeutic effect and adverse effects unpredictable. There is also a risk of disease transmission from donor to recipient. FMT cannot easily be delivered at scale because it is limited by donor capacity. 
• The solution: Novel Faecal Bioreactor Development. The development of such a bioreactor would allow the large-scale manufacture of a standardised complex microbial therapy or synthetic FMT. This synthetic product could be refined to an optimised microbial population to enhance therapeutic efficacy. There is huge commercial potential in developing and optimizing a cellulose hydrogel-based bioreactor that mimics the human gut. The bioreactor will be seeded with stool from a healthy donor and fed prebiotic fibres to produce an engineered stool with the gut microbial composition comparable to that of healthy “super donor”. The successful development of the bioreactor will eliminate the need for repeated stool donations and reduce the risk of disease transmission. The bioreactor will allow microbial product to be manufactured continuously on industrial scale thereby facilitating export worldwide."

"Active transport research priorities for Australia Bicycling; Bike; Cyclist Background: To advance active transport, robust policy-relevant evidence is needed to understand how to change behaviour and to support decision-making by policy makers and practitioners. Currently, however, priority research questions that are most critical for advancing active transport have not been identified. To this end, we aimed to inform an active transport research priority agenda for Australia to guide research, funding, policy making and practice to enhance active transport. Methods: We designed and conducted a novel priority setting exercise to identify and set research priorities for the advancement of active transport in Australia. The process consisted of three phases: 1) generation and collection of research questions from a diverse reference group consisting of experts and key members representing academia, government, private and not-for-profit organisations (n = 259 respondents); 2) thematic analysis and consolidation of research questions to a final list of 50 questions; and 3) prioritisation of research questions by the reference group (n = 140 respondents). Results: The top ranked questions included the evidence to support policy changes to increase active transport, identifying and overcoming community resistance to active transport infrastructure, road space re-allocation and lower urban speed limits, evidence on the needs of children, enhanced governance and funding, and improving how the benefits of active transport are best measured and communicated. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first priority setting exercise in active transport globally. The identified research priorities can be used to identify new policy-relevant areas of research, contribute to the active transport research agenda in Australia and guide research funding. Focusing on these research priorities will address stakeholder and academic priorities and provide the evidence required to support the advancement of active transport in Australia. Future research could use the same approach to identify research priorities in other countries."

"Unravelling soil carbon response to warming in fire-affected ecosystems (ext led by Griffith University) This project aims to reveal the Australian and global patterns of soil carbon (C) response to warming in fireaffected ecosystems and to unravel the biogeochemical mechanisms underlying fire’s role in shaping the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. Fire has modified over 40% of the Earth’s land surface and wildfire frequency is predicted to increase under global warming. This project expects to generate new knowledge on how fire influences soil-to-atmosphere C fluxes in a warmer climate using global and multi-disciplinary approaches. Expected outcomes include an enhanced capacity to predict the terrestrial ecosystem-to-atmosphere C fluxes and
their feedbacks to climate under increasing frequency of fire using Earth-system models."
"Replication of a Tissue Microenvironment by Thermal Scanning Probe Lithography Osteoblasts; Vinculin; Titanium Alloy Thermal scanning probe lithography (t-SPL) is a nanofabrication technique in which an immobilized thermolabile resist, such as polyphthalaldehyde (PPA), is locally vaporized by a heated atomic force microscope tip. Compared with other nanofabrication techniques, such as soft lithography and nanoimprinting lithography, t-SPL is more efficient and convenient as it does not involve time-consuming mask productions or complicated etching procedures, making it a promising candidate technique for the fast prototyping of nanoscale topographies for biological studies. Here, we established the direct use of PPA-coated surfaces as a cell culture substrate. We showed that PPA is biocompatible and that the deposition of allylamine by plasma polymerization on a silicon wafer before PPA coating can stabilize the immobilization of PPA in aqueous solutions. When seeded on PPA-coated surfaces, human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) adhered, spread, and proliferated in a manner indistinguishable from cells cultured on glass surfaces. This allowed us to subsequently use t-SPL to generate nanotopographies for cell culture experiments. As a proof of concept, we analyzed the surface topography of bovine tendon sections, previously shown to induce morphogenesis and differentiation of MSC, by means of atomic force microscopy, and then ""wrote"" topographical data on PPA by means of t-SPL. The resulting substrate, matching the native tissue topography on the nanoscale, was directly used for MSC culture. The t-SPL substrate induced similar changes in cell morphology and focal adhesion formation in the MSC compared to native tendon sections, suggesting that t-SPL can rapidly generate cell culture substrates with complex and spatially accurate topographical signals. This technique may greatly accelerate the prototyping of models for the study of cell-matrix interactions."

"University buildings: The push and pull for sustainability Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Universities are a key stakeholder in our built environment with buildings in many major cities around Australia and the world. Due to their primarily urban locations, size and number of staff and students, universities and their activities are a significant contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. Increasingly universities both in Australia and globally are looking for ways to improve their sustainability outcomes. This recognizes that higher education institutions can do more to help in the transition to a low-carbon future, but also that by adopting sustainability initiatives, universities help reduce operating costs and facilitate healthier and more productive staff and students. This chapter explores the role of universities and their sustainability initiatives including their challenges of servicing complex stakeholders in a transition to a low-carbon future. After discussing relevant policies and rating tools, five key examples that go significantly beyond minimum performance requirements from prominent Australian universities are presented. Evident from the examples is that there continues to be no one-size-fits-all approach for universities to become more sustainable. It will require complex considerations of the requirements of the university anticipated future needs as well as a wide-ranging evaluation of the most appropriate pathways forward. Ultimately, it is encouraging to see key universities engaging more seriously with improving sustainability outcomes, not only in Australia but also globally. Universities have the opportunity to not just improve sustainability of their facilities, but to also demonstrate to their hundreds of thousands of students and staff how the built environment can be designed to benefit both the environment and the occupants."

"Predicting wavelength-dependent photochemical reactivity and selectivity Click Chemistry; Click; Sulfur Fluorides Predicting the conversion and selectivity of a photochemical experiment is a conceptually different challenge compared to thermally induced reactivity. Photochemical transformations do not currently have the same level of generalized analytical treatment due to the nature of light interaction with a photoreactive substrate. Herein, we bridge this critical gap by introducing a framework for the quantitative prediction of the time-dependent progress of photoreactions via common LEDs. A wavelength and concentration dependent reaction quantum yield map of a model photoligation, i.e., the reaction of thioether o-methylbenzaldehydes via o-quinodimethanes with N-ethylmaleimide, is initially determined with a tunable laser system. Combined with experimental parameters, the data are employed to predict LED-light induced conversion through a wavelength-resolved numerical simulation. The model is validated with experiments at varied wavelengths. Importantly, a second algorithm allows the assessment of competing photoreactions and enables the facile design of Î»-orthogonal ligation systems based on substituted o-methylbenzaldehydes."
"The rationale and design of a Mediterranean diet accompanied by time restricted feeding to optimise the management of type 2 diabetes: The MedDietFast randomised controlled trial Mediterranean Diet; Adherence; Cardiovascular Disease Background and aims: Substantial scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Potential benefits of time restricted feeding (TRF) in T2DM are unknown. The MedDietFast trial aims to investigate the efficacy of a MedDiet with or without TRF compared to standard care diet in managing T2DM. Methods and results: 120 adults aged 20â€“75 with a body mass index (BMI) of 20â€“35 kg/m2 and T2DM will be randomised in a 3-arm parallel design to follow an ad libitum MedDiet with or without 12-h TRF or the standard Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) for 24 weeks. All groups will receive dietary counselling fortnightly for 12 weeks and monthly thereafter. The primary outcome is changes in HbA1c from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes include fasting blood glucose, insulin, blood lipids, weight loss, insulin resistance index (HOMA), Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and high-sensitivity C- reactive protein (hs-CRP). Data on medical history, anthropometry, wellbeing, MedDiet adherence and satiety will be measured at a private clinic via self-report questionnaires at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. Additionally, specimens (blood, urine and stool) will be collected at all time points for future omics analysis. Conclusion: The MedDietFast trial will examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a MedDiet with/without TRF in T2DM patients. Potential synergistic effects of a MedDiet with TRF will be evaluated. Future studies will generate microbiomic and metabolomic data for translation of findings into simple and effective management plans for T2DM patients.

"Testing Requirements via User and System Stories in Agent Systems Software; Agent-Oriented Software Engineering; Agent Architecture Agile software development is a popular and widely adopted practice due to its flexible and iterative nature that facilitates rapid prototyping. Recent work presented an agile approach to capturing requirements in agent systems via user and system stories. User and system stories present the requirements from the user and system perspective, respectively. Each story contains a set of acceptance criteria, which are a set of statements that identify the conditions under which the system behaviour can be accepted by the users or stakeholders. In this paper, we present a novel approach to testing the requirements that are specified via User and System stories in an agent system. We do this by developing a systematic approach to validating the execution traces output by the system against the specified acceptance criteria for each story. The approach identifies acceptance criteria that are met successfully in execution and those that fail. We present a fault model that categorizes the failures providing insight to the developers to address the failed cases. We classify three kinds of faults for a given acceptance criterion: (a) the trigger condition is never met; (b) when the trigger occurs the preconditions are not met; or (c) the trigger and preconditions are met but the resulting actions are not as expected. The motivating application of our work, which is also the test-bed for evaluation, is an agent-based simulation application for modelling the behaviours of civilians in a bushfire emergency scenario that is used in practice. We show our approach is able to successfully test and uncover requirements that were not met in this application."
"Police failure in identifying victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation: an empirical study in Vietnam Human Trafficking; Sexual Exploitation; Prostitution Police officers are considered as key actors in responding to the illicit trade in people in Vietnam. Based on 150 surveys and 25 in-depth interviews with these officers in five provinces/cities and one ministerial agency, this study explores challenges in identifying victims of sex trafficking. This research determined some police-related obstacles to identification, including lack of priority for identification of victims, stigmatization of sex workers, ignorance of ethnic minoritiesâ€™ immigration for work, low quality of training courses, weaknesses in foreign and ethnic minoritiesâ€™ languages, and ineffectiveness of interagency cooperation. The purpose of underlining such problems is to confirm that police weakness may contribute to lowered number of identified victims of sex trafficking."

"A Clustering Approach to Identify High-Risk Taxi Drivers Based on Self-Reported Driving Behavior Traffic Behavior; Aggressive Driving; Anger This study aimed to evaluate the driving behavior of taxi drivers in Isfahan, Iran, and assess the probability of a driver being among the high-risk taxi drivers. To identify risky driving behaviors among taxi drivers, the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) was used. By collecting data from 548 taxi drivers, exploratory factor analysis identified the significant components of DBQ including ""Inattention errors,""""Inexperience errors,""""Lapses,""""Ordinary violations,""and ""Aggressive violations.""K-means clustering was conducted to cluster taxi drivers into three risk groups of low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk taxi drivers based on their self-reported annual traffic crashes and fines. In addition, logistic regressions identified the extent to which drivers' crashes and traffic fines are related to their driving behavior, and therefore, what aberrant driving behaviors are more important in explaining the presence of taxi drivers in the high-risk cluster. The results revealed that the majority of participants (66.78%) were low-risk taxi drivers. Aggressive violations and ordinary violations were significant predictors of taxi drivers being in the high-risk group, while inattention errors and aggressive violations were significant predictors of being in the medium/high-risk cluster. The findings from this study are valuable resources for developing safety measures and training for new drivers in the taxi industry."
"Investigation on the fracture and mechanical behaviors of simulated transversely isotropic rock made of two interbedded materials Brazilian Test; Transversely Isotropic; Tensile Strength Transversely isotropic rock composed of two interbedded layers has been rarely studied, although landslides frequently occur in bedded rock masses. With reference to the interbedded rock mass in the Miaowei Reservoir area of Yunnan Province, China, this study prepares transversely isotropic specimens made of two interbedded materials to investigate the fracture and mechanical behaviors of interbedded rock. The effect of the bedding plane dip angle and the application of the findings to an anti-dip interbedded rock slope are also studied. Specifically, two groups of isotropic specimens and five groups of transversely isotropic specimens are tested in a series of triaxial compressive tests; based on these tests, the crack types, failure modes and mechanical parameters are analyzed, and one damage model and its application to the failure probability analysis of an anti-dip interbedded rock slope are investigated. The experimental results show that twelve crack types, eight failure modes and five axial stress-strain curve types can be summarized and are significantly affected by the dip angle. The recognition of these crack types and failure modes can improve the qualitative instability analysis of bedded rock masses in the reservoir area, and five mechanical parameters, including peak stress, strain related to peak strength, residual strength, elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio, exhibit fluctuating variation trends versus the dip angle and confining stress due to the influence of the dip angle. Two groups of theoretical curves from the proposed damage model correspond with the pre-peak features of the test stress-strain curves. The proposed failure probability model considering rock damage shows good practicality when applied to an anti-dip interbedded rock slope; the slope displays discrete failure probabilities in various parts, e.g., the slope toe, slope shoulder and weaker layer show higher failure probabilities, and the relaxation behavior increases the failure probabilities and gradually eliminates the discreteness. Relevancy analysis shows that the strength of transversely isotropic rock is more sensitive to the elastic modulus, dip angle of bedding plane, confining stress and composition of the rock."

"Towards ecological bushfire management models  ""We propose a multidisciplinary workshop gathering scientists and stakeholders from various domains: ecology, social science, technology, Earth observation science, data science, computer science and mathematics, so as to identify new opportunities and research avenues for bushfire management and, more generally, for land management. 

Real case optimisation modelling can be roughly defined as the combination of a CONTEXT, related DATA, MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSES and NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION.  Here, we will focus on the three first components. The implementation and computational tests will be addressed later for specific identified problems.  Following this logic, the workshop is organised in three days: 
1. Ecological wager of fire and alternative practices including notably the impact of fires on emblematic species and the question of traditional Aboriginal fires 
2. Data science for ecological data that merges data mining, geospatial sciences and space technologies.
3. Ecological and ecosystem perspective in model-based bushfire management: a capstone on how to embed the conclusions of the two first days into mathematical optimisation models for fire land management.

The workshop is scheduled from 12 to 14 November 2018 in room 80.04.20 and 80.04.21.  It includes a public lecture (by Cristina Montiel Molina Professor of Regional Geography, University Complutensa of Madrid / Pau Costa Foundation,  Spain) during the evening of 12 November in  80.07.01 (topic to be announced). We expect 40 participants for the workshop and 80 for the public lecture.

It will be the opportunity to engage, internally, with the Sir Lawrence Wackett Centre and aerospace engineering and externally, with visitors from local and international universities.

"Influence of the Intrinsic Nanocore Environment in a Pd-Metalated Porous Organic Polymer for Catalytic Biomass-Derived Furfural Upgrading Hydrogenation; Furfuryl Alcohol; 2-Methylfuran Metalated nanoporous organic polymers (M-POPs) combine covalent bonds and open metal sites to enable structural stability and single-site catalysis. In this work, we constructed two single-site Pd-metalated knitting aromatic polymers (Pd@KAP-1 and Pd@KAP-2) and explored their catalytic activity in lignocellulosic biomass-derived furfural (FFR) upgrading to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFAL), a green industrial solvent. Pd@KAP-1 exhibits superior catalytic performance compared to Pd@KAP-2 toward FFR conversion, resulting in 80% conversion with a 95% selectivity toward THFAL. Using in situ DRIFTS analysis, we find that FFR strongly adsorbs on Pd@KAP-1, which is a key determining factor in its higher catalytic efficiency. Our X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements show a lower (âˆ¼0.3 eV) binding energy displacement of Pd-3d5/2in Pd@KAP-1 compared to Pd@KAP-2. We attribute this to the presence of a biphenyl ring that enables partial charge transfer between the P and the Pd atoms inside the nanocavity of Pd@KAP-1 to facilitate catalytic hydrogenation. We also carried out a kinetic analysis showing that Pd@KAP-1 has a lower activation barrier than Pd@KAP-2 for the FFR hydrogenation process. Our study demonstrates a novel concept for designing efficient, robust, and sustainable metalated porous organic polymer-based heterogeneous nanocatalysts in biomass refinery industries."

"Precursor considerations for new circular economy business models Industrial Symbiosis; Sustainable Development; Circular Economy Circular economy thinking encourages society to adopt sustainable patterns of consumption and production. This basic principle aligns with the objectives of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which include improving human welfare through equal access to drinking water and sanitation; together with reliable, sustainable, and modern energy supplies for all. Traditional approaches to delivering public utility services have been rooted within the Baconian view that the environment is a pool of resources that exist for the betterment of humankind. Whilst this tradition has delivered water supply, sanitation, electricity generation, and waste management services, that have improved the lives of countless humans, the provision of these services largely relies on business models and technologies that have had significant adverse impact upon the natural environment. To inform the development of new sustainable business models, this paper explores circularity concepts from the perspective of decision makers and actors responsible for the delivery of public utility infrastructure. Through a review of the secondary literature, this paper examines core circular economy principles and maps these against fundamental business model elements to synthesise a framework of precursor considerations for future business models. This framework has potential application in testing the extent to which existing business models in the utility sector support the transition to a circular economy and how current business models can be adapted to assist the achievement of sustainable development."
"Scientometric review of construction demolition waste management: a global sustainability perspective Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management The increase in construction projects with rising construction demolition waste (CDW) challenges is alarming, and it poses a significant threat to sustainable urban development. The challenge of CDW management (CDWM) is noteworthy with varied consequences on social, economic, environmental, and physical development perspectives. Although there has been research from different perspectives on CDWM for over 40 years, there is a limited scientometric review research in these areas to date. This study, therefore, conducts a global scientometric analysis of CDWM articles to understand its sustainable development research approach for further studies. Article titles, keywords, and abstract search methods were used to extract related articles from the year 2000 to 2021. A total of 4374 articles retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection were analysed using CiteSpace software for scientometric analysis. The result revealed active research on CDWM from influential researchers, research institutes, institutions, reputable journals, and countries. The policy recommendations and frameworks adopted in the past have focused more on reducing, recycling and reuse (3R), and they adopt these strategies and others as single strategies for improving CDWM. These strategies are limited in integrating sustainable development strategies such as the circular economy and bio-dynamic. This study concludes that there is a need for a comprehensive research approach that incorporates the economic, social, and physical implications of CDWM to maximise the value of CDW for sustainable development. It presents a comprehensive scientometric analysis of the CDWM, adds to the existing knowledge of CDWM sustainability approach, and provides insights for future research direction relevant for the academics, professionals, and government agencies in CDWM projects."

"Examining the relationship between urban liveability and gender-based violence: A systematic review. Alcohol Drinking; Underage Drinking; Neighborhood Characteristics Gender-based violence can include, but is not limited to, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, rape, and intimate partner homicide. It is well-established that gender inequality is the main driver of gender-based violence. However, little work has attempted to unpack how gender-based violence perpetuates within the neighbourhood context, and whether â€˜liveabilityâ€™ attributes might intersect with gender inequality and violence. We systematically reviewed quantitative evidence examining associations between gender-based violence and several liveability neighbourhood-level factors. MEDLINE (Ovid) and Scopus databases yielded 1822 potentially relevant articles. 50 articles met inclusion criteria. Neighbourhood social capital was most consistently associated with reduced gender-based violence. Few studies examined built environment attributes (e.g. gambling venue densities, access to services). Future research is needed to more deeply examine how combinations of salutogenic or pathogenic neighbourhood attributes may reinforce or prevent violence."

"Nitrogen contamination and bioremediation in groundwater and the environment: A review Nitrate Pollution; Denitrification; Isotopes Nitrogen contamination of groundwater and the environment is an increasing problem in today's society. Since the invention of the Haber-Bosh process in 1913, the impacts of N on human health and the environment have become increasingly widespread due to the industrial scale production of reactive N (Nr). As a result, government organisations and the scientific community continue to make advances towards tackling this ongoing problem. The inherent difficulties of accessing, observing and monitoring groundwater, combined with the complexity of interactions between groundwater chemistry, hydrogeology and ecology have resulted in gaps in fundamental knowledge, specifically regarding the understanding and remediation of N contaminated groundwater. As these knowledge gaps are addressed with ongoing research, current and future remediation targets are being consistently updated; this has resulted in past remediation strategies that may no longer be consistent in meeting new regulatory guidelines for water quality. As such, the search for more technically and economically feasible remediation strategies continues. Recent advances in bioremediation technologies have opened up promising avenues for research in the remediation of N contaminated groundwater.

"Mixed Ionic-Electronic Charge Transport in Layered Black-Phosphorus for Low-Power Memory Oxygen Vacancy; Random Access Memory; Memristors Availability of computing will be strongly limited by global energy production in 1â€“2 decades. Computing consumes 4â€“5% of global electricity supply and continues to increase. This is underpinned by memory and switching devices encountering leakage as they are downscaled. Twoâ€‘dimensional (2D) materials offer a potential solution to the fundamental problem owing to carrier confinement which significantly reduces scattering events. Herein, a mixed ionicâ€‘electronic transport is used in layered black phosphorus (BP) based vertically stacked resistance change memories. The memory device relies on a unique interplay between the oxygen and silver ion diffusion through the stack which is generated using a combination of bottom (electrochemically active silver) and top (indium tin oxide) electrodes. The use of a transparent top-electrode enabled for the first time to conduct spectroscopic characterization of the device and experimentally reveal fundamental mechanisms. Endurance of the devices are observed to be >104 switching cycles, with ON/OFF current ratio of >107 and standby power consumption of <5 fW, which effectively suppresses leakage current and sneak paths in a memory array. By undertaking detailed microscopic and spectroscopic investigations, supported by theoretical calculations, this work opens opportunities to enhance resistive switching performances of 2D materials for nextâ€‘generation information storage and brainâ€‘inspired computation."

"Persulfate oxidation-assisted membrane distillation process for micropollutant degradation and membrane fouling control Activation; Sulfate Radical; Advanced Oxidation In this study, long-term performance of a persulfate (PS)-assisted direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) process was examined for the treatment of secondary treated effluent spiked with a mixture of micropollutants including three pesticides and nine pharmaceuticals. A stand-alone DCMD (â€˜controlâ€™) was also operated under identical operating conditions for comparison. Depending on the micropollutant, the stand-alone DCMD achieved 86 to >99% removal. In comparison, removal by the PS-assisted DCMD was >99% for all investigated micropollutants. This was attributed to the fact that sulfate radicals (SO4â€“[rad]) formed following the activation of PS at the DCMD operating temperature (i.e., 40 Â°C) achieved micropollutant-specific degradation, which reduced the accumulation of micropollutants in the feed. Chemical structures of the micropollutants governed their degradation by PS. Effective degradation (>90%) was achieved for micropollutants that contain strong electron-donating functional groups (EDGs) in their molecules (e.g., amitriptyline and trimethoprim). Micropollutants containing both strong electron-withdrawing functional groups (EWGs) and EDGs in their molecules were moderately degraded (60â€“80%). In addition to the micropollutants, activated PS significantly degraded total organic carbon (70%) and total nitrogen (40%) from the secondary treated wastewater. This helped to reduce the fouling layer on the membrane-surface in the PS-assisted DCMD system. PS-addition appears to slightly increase the toxicity of wastewater, but with effective retention of PS and degradation products, DCMD permeate (i.e., treated effluent) was not toxic. This is the first study demonstrating the performance of the persulfate oxidation process in a continuous-flow membrane system for micropollutant removal and membrane fouling control."

"Alkali-activated electrospun carbon nanofibers as an efficient bifunctional adsorbent for cationic and anionic dyes Biosorbents; Congo Red; Adsorption Activated electrospun carbon nanofibers (A-ECNFs) with micro/mesoporous structures and high surface areas (1615 m2 gâˆ’1) were prepared using electrospinning technique followed by carbonization and alkali activation. The adsorption of Congo red (CR) and methylene blue (MB) dyes by A-ECNFs from aqueous solutions was investigated and compared with those of pristine ECNFs. The textural characteristics and morphology of the prepared pristine and activated ECNFs were characterized using various techniques. The adsorption performance was found to be associated to the surface area, porosity, and surface charges of the prepared adsorbents, the nature and molecular size of the dyes, and the pH and temperature of the solution. Six nonlinear isotherm models were applied to analyze the adsorption equilibrium data, and the results showed that the adsorption behavior could be appropriately described using the Redlichâ€“Peterson isotherm model. The kinetic results for the adsorption of CR and MB onto A-ECNFs were fitted reasonably well to the Elovich model and were fitted by a pseudo-second order (PSO) model onto the pristine ECNFs. According to the thermodynamic results, the adsorption of CR and MB onto the A-ECNFs was endothermic and spontaneous. In addition, the reusability of the A-ECNFs was evaluated over five adsorption-desorption cycles."

"Towards computer vision and deep learning facilitated pollination monitoring for agriculture Bombus; Bees; Neonicotinoids Globally, pollinators affect 35% of agricultural land and play a key role in food production. Consequently, monitoring is useful to understand the contribution insects make towards crop pollination. Traditional sampling techniques used in insect monitoring have several drawbacks, including that they are labour intensive and potentially unreliable. Some of these drawbacks may be overcome using computer vision and deep learning-based approaches to automate pollination monitoring. In this paper, we present a pipeline for computer vision-based pollination monitoring and propose a novel algorithm, Polytrack, that tracks multiple insects simultaneously in complex agricultural environments. Our algorithm uses deep learning and fore-ground/background segmentation to detect and track in-sects. We achieved precision and recall rates of 0.975 and 0.972 respectively when monitoring honeybees foraging in our test sites within the polytunnels of an industrial straw-berry farm. Polytrack includes a flower identification module to automate collection of insect-flower interaction data, and a low-resolution processing mode that reduces computational demands placed on the processor to bring the software towards the requirements of low-powered monitoring hardware."
"How do institutional innovation systems affect open innovation? Alliance Portfolios; Firm; Open Innovation It is well known that innovation benefits firms and that openness may enhance these benefits. Yet few studies consider how a firmâ€™s institutional context and different economic systems moderate openness and innovation outcomes in new ventures, which arguably are most exposed to institutional constraints. Comparing data from a liberal (Australia) and central market economy (China), and using search breadth as a measure of openness, we empirically tested the influence of external firm pressures on the relationship between openness and innovation outcomes in new ventures. Our results show that the well-established positive relationship between openness and innovation is market dependent and that, in emerging economies, it can be negative. Our findings demonstrate the importance of institutions and national economic systems in explaining open innovation in different contextsâ€“a point not yet addressed in the open innovation literature."

"Women's Refuges and Critical Social Work: Opportunities and Challenges in Advancing Social Justice Emigration And Immigration; Resettlement; Asylum Women's refuges play a crucial role in responding to the needs of women and children experiencing family violence; yet there has been limited research conducted into their operations, practices and challenges faced. This article is informed by critical social work's theoretical tradition of seeking to end social injustice and analyses key opportunities and challenges of providing refuge amidst a neo-liberal context. We draw on interviews and focus groups with service providers and women who had sought access to a refuge, from a study that was undertaken following the Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence in Australia. We found widespread practices by refuges to support social justice for women and children experiencing family violence, as well as challenges and constraints, substantially linked to resource limitations consistent with neo-liberal policies. This research shines a light on innovative refuge practice in local contexts identifying feminist social justice and intersectional practices aligned with critical social work."

"Privacy Versus Relatedness: Managing Device Use in Australia’s Remote Aboriginal Communities Yolngu; Aboriginal Australians; Anthropology Aboriginal Australians living in remote communities are likely to be â€œmobile onlyâ€ users. The sharing of devices among kin is common and linked to demand sharing practices that stretch back to presettler times. While sharing can produce benefits (acting as a form of insurance), it can also lead to privacy-related problems among this group, including illicit use of banking and social media accounts via shared devices. In this article, we examine the ways in which the aspect of Aboriginal sociality known as relatedness is interacting with online privacy frameworks designed for individual device use and device management. The findings suggest that the sociotechnical frameworks of platforms and devices do not accord with cultural dynamics, including obligations to others. Moreover, efforts by individuals and Elders to avoid privacy-related problems are leading to digital exclusion in various forms, from the deliberate destruction of devices to whole communities opting out of mobile infrastructure."

"Ultrathin Solar Absorber Layers of Silver Bismuth Sulfide from Molecular Precursors Agbis2; Thin Films; Absorbers (Materials) Here we present a robust molecular precursor-based approach to synthesize high-quality thin films of silver bismuth sulfide (AgBiS 2 ). Pure-phase cubic AgBiS 2 thin films are prepared, which are smooth and dense down to thicknesses less than 40 nm. Comprehensive structural and morphological analysis of the as-prepared films as a function of processing temperature and composition is presented, including X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The optical properties of the films and their electronic band structure are also presented. The as-prepared films show impressive light absorption properties with absorption coefficients reaching 10 5 cm -1 for energies above ca. 950 nm. Finally, their photoactivity is demonstrated through photoconductivity measurements on lateral electrodes. The methods outlined herein enable the fabrication of AgBiS 2 semiconductor thin films at low processing temperatures (150 Â°C) with a dense morphology and tunable Ag/Bi composition. Such films provide an excellent platform for the fabrication of AgBiS 2 -based optoelectronic devices, specifically solar cells."

"‘More than a day job, a fair job: music graduate employment in education’ Cultural Economy; Freelancer; Art The focus on graduate employability for Creative Industries has tended to overlook the significance of the education sector as a destination. This article makes a case for the educational logic of music careers considered as an example of the developmental agenda embedded in the concept of â€˜cultureâ€™. It further supports this account by looking at longitudinal graduate destination data in both Australia and the UK that shows the importance of education employment to music careers. It considers music graduate outcomes in both countries according to university tier, graduate level employment, and career satisfaction. It finds that outcomes differ significantly in terms of gender, and that careers in education are no less rewarding than those in music professions. Attention to the â€˜educational logic of cultureâ€™ suggests there are opportunities for creative industries policy to better support links between the creative economy and education."
"The paradox of accounting for cultural heritage: a longitudinal study on the financial reporting of heritage assets of major Australian public cultural institutions (1992–2019) Accrual Accounting; International Public Sector Accounting Standards; Local Government Purpose: The monetary valuation of cultural heritage of a selection of 16 major public, not-for-profit Australian cultural institutions is examined over a period of almost three decades (1992â€“2019) to understand how they have responded to the paradoxical tensions of heritage valuation for financial reporting purposes. Design/methodology/approach: Accounting for cultural heritage is an intrinsically paradoxical practice; it involves a conflict of two opposite ways of attributing value: the traditional accounting and the heritage professionals (or curatorial) approaches. In analysing the annual reports and other documentary sources through qualitative content analysis, the study explores how different actors responded to the conceptual and technical contradictions posed by the monetary valuation of â€œheritage assetsâ€, the accounting phraseology of accounting standards. Findings: Four phases emerge from the analysis undertaken of the empirical material, each characterised by a distinctive nature of the paradox, the institutional responses discerned and the outcomes. Although a persisting heterogeneity in the practice of accounting for cultural heritage is evident, responses by cultural institutions are shown to have minimised, so far, the negative impacts of monetary valuation in terms of commercialisation of deaccessioning decisions and distorted accountability. Originality/value: In applying the theoretical lens of paradox theory in the context of the financial reporting of heritage, as assets, the study enhances an understanding of the challenges and responses by major public cultural institutions in a country that has led this development globally, providing insights to accounting standard setters arising from the accounting practices observed."
"Temperature shocks and energy poverty: Findings from Vietnam Energy; Energy Poverty; Fuelwood Globally, billions of people live in energy poverty without the means to access affordable and clean energy which are fundamental to sustainable development. Climate change is aggravating increasing demand for energy through a general rise in temperatures as well as through short periods of unusually high heat. This paper examines the impact of temperature shocks on energy poverty in Vietnam. Using data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (2010 to 2016) and data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts it finds temperature shocks lead to increases in a measure of multidimensional energy poverty. This finding is robust to different measures of temperature shocks. Households in the North and Central coast regions of Vietnam are most prone to the impacts of temperature shocks as well as households located in rural areas. Further findings suggest that temperature shocks impact on energy poverty through reducing agricultural output."

"Higher Adherence to a Mediterranean Diet Is Associated with Improved Insulin Sensitivity and Selected Markers of Inflammation in Individuals Who Are Overweight and Obese without Diabetes Mediterranean Diet; Adherence; Cardiovascular Disease Insulin resistance (IR) and chronic low-grade inflammation are risk factors for chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to investigate two dietary indices: Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DIIÂ®), and their associations with direct measures of glucose metabolism and adiposity, and biochemical measures including lipids, cytokines and adipokines in overweight/obese adults. This cross-sectional study included 65 participants (males = 63%; age 31.3 Â± 8.5 years). Dietary intake via 3-day food diaries was used to measure adherence to MDS (0â€“45 points); higher scores indicating adherence. Energy-adjusted DII (E-DII) scores were calculated with higher scores indicating a pro-inflammatory diet. IR was assessed using hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps, insulin secretion by intravenous glucose tolerance test, adiposity by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and circulating cytokine and adipokine concentrations by multiplex assays. Higher MDS was associated with greater insulin sensitivity (Î² = 0.179; 95%CI: 0.39, 0.318) after adjusting for age, sex and % body fat, and lower NF-ÎºB, higher adiponectin and adipsin in unadjusted and adjusted models. Higher E-DII score was associated with increased total cholesterol (Î² = 0.364; 95%CI: 0.066, 0.390) and LDL-cholesterol (Î² = 0.305; 95%CI: 0.019, 0.287) but not with adiposity, glucose metabolism, cytokines or adipokines. Greater MDS appears to be associated with decreased IR and inflammatory markers in overweight/obese adults."

"Meat Industry Efficiency and Innovation Capacity Enhancement; Benchmarking Technologies and systems from Automotive Industry This project will focus on accelerating the adoption of new technologies by benchmarking the competitive, and sustainable Automotive manufacturing industry. The Automotive industry, as a high volume- low margin sector, is the pioneer in automating manual tasks, by developing the most advanced and cost-effective systems.
Development of innovative manufacturing, processing, materials handling solutions and technologies as well as management systems and appropriate culture has helped the automotive industry to stay efficient and sustainable for many years. On the other hand the Australian automotive industry is leaving a huge number of culturally trained and skilled workers behind.
All the above mentioned makes the need for an extensive research in adapting and using the already existing technologies, strategies and systems in the Automotive industry inevitable. A PhD research project for the duration of 3 years to study the possibilities and potentials for the red meat industry to adapt technologies and solutions in the field of automation, materials handling solutions, management of processes and procedures, and quality assurance systems developed and used by the Automotive industry is proposed.
The research outcomes will generate a database for a rapid knowledge transfer in order to improve red meat industry's innovation capacity on a sustained basis. This will ensure quick knowledge transfer by enabling the industry to acquire skills, as well as a huge number of skilled and culturally trained, unemployed workforce. This database will generate a bank for several future research activities in line with the AMPC capability building strategic plans."
"Australia's push to make residential housing sustainable - Do end-users care? Green Building; Construction Industry; Project Delivery The Australian construction industry is transitioning to becoming more sustainable. Despite their crucial role, Australian communities as the end-users of this transition have been overlooked. Buildings contribute as much as 30% of the total waste produced and as much as 40% of total greenhouse gases. Residential construction makes up the biggest sector in construction; about 80% by cost. If sustainable construction is to be realised, it must take root in the housing sector. Little progress, however, has been made. Current literature places much of the blame with the owners and occupiers of houses â€“ The line goes that builders would build sustainable houses if people really wanted them. The question arises: are reported societal concerns for sustainability merely superficial or supported by intention and commitment to act. This study aimed to test public resolve for a transition to sustainable residential housing. Three focus groups, drawn from three diverse communities within the greater Melbourne metropolitan region, were engaged in describing and explaining community views on the desirability of sustainable housing. The unanimous consensus is that people want housing to be more sustainable, but that this is not forthcoming because of the intransigence of government and builders to facilitate a needed culture of change within the residential housing sector. This study contributes to the field, providing a model that encapsulates various dimensions of community's, namely, end-usersâ€™ perceptions, based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Findings provide a sound basis for future researchers to address the challenges identified. The study also raises awareness of policymakers and industry practitioners of the genuine needs and requirements of end-users of residential buildings."

"Ranolazine-functionalized copper nanoparticles as a colorimetric sensor for trace level detection of as3+ Printed Electronics; Inkjet Printing; Copper This study involves environmentally friendly synthesis of copper nanoparticles in aqueous medium without inert gas protection, using ranolazine as a capping material. UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrometry showed that ranolazine-derived copper nanoparticles (Rano-Cu NPs) demonstrate a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band at 573 nm with brick-red color under optimized parameters, including pH, reaction time, and concentrations of copper salt, hydrazine hydrate, and ranolazine. The coating of ranolazine on the surface of Cu NPs was studied via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that Rano-Cu NPs consist of spherical particles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) verified that Rano-Cu NPs are crystalline in nature. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the average size of Rano-Cu NPs was 40 Â± 2 nm in the range of 22â€“95 nm. Rano-Cu NPs proved to be highly sensitive as a selective colorimetric sensor for As3+ via color change from brick red to dark green, in the linear range of 3.0 Ã— 10âˆ’7 to 8.3 Ã— 10âˆ’6 M, with an R2 value of 0.9979. The developed sensor is simple, cost effective, highly sensitive, and extremely selective for As3+ detection, showing a low detection limit (LDL) of 1.6 Ã— 10âˆ’8 M. The developed sensor was effectively tested for detection of As3+ in some water samples."

"Wearable sensors for gait assessment of neuromotor disorder patients to prevent freezing of gait Associated with ageing population and rise in degenerative neuromotor disorders, there is the increase in falls due to freezing of gait (FOG), especially among patients of Parkinson’s disease. There are more people suffering from injuries due to falls [Yatar, and Yildirim 2015] than people having cardiovascular disease. Most of these are preventable if a timely cue is provided to the patient. This requires detecting the condition which requires the monitoring of the gait of these individuals and giving the required interventional cues [Solanki et al., 2017]. It has also been shown that risk of falls can be identified by assessment of the gait and posture of the person, while its trends can be better understood by investigating the muscle activity. Based on this, suitable cues and timely intervention can prevent many falls among the elderly patients of Parkinson’s disease [Patel et al., 2017]. 

The current gait analysis is performed using high speed multiple video cameras and pressure mats placed over the purpose-built walkway. These methods are useful in identifying abnormalities in the gait and posture of the patient but require large infrastructure laboratories that are expensive and located in major urban hospitals. These require extensive manual observations which make it impossible for real-time cues to the patients that will help improve their behaviors or give real-time feedback to the patients. The other shortcoming in such gait-analysis is that the person is not located in their personal comfort zone and thus their gait is not natural. There is an urgent need for wearable wireless gait analysis devices that can be used to record the walking of the individual while having the freedom of walking naturally in their own homes. "
"Designer Ecosystems for the Anthropocene—Deliberately Creating Novel Ecosystems in Cultural Landscapes Anthropocene; Climate Change; Environment Crisis Accepting that nature and culture are intricately co-evolved has profound implications for the ethical, legal, philosophical and pragmatic dimensions of social and environmental policy. The way we think about nature affects how we understand and manage ecosystems. While the ideals of preserving wilderness and conserving ecosystems have motivated much conservation effort to date, achieving these ideals may not be feasible under Anthropocene conditions unless communities accept custodial responsibilities for landscapes and other species. This paperâ€™s origins are in the authorâ€™s work with the Martuwarra Fitzroy River Council representing Indigenous traditional owners in Australiaâ€™s Kimberley region. These landscapes, shaped by 60,000 years of human occupation, interweave knowledge, laws and governance regimes, and material and spiritual connections with country. This interweaving offers insights into options for dealing with humanityâ€™s complex sustainability challenges. The paper also draws on the literature about cultural landscapes, ecological design, agroecology and permaculture to explore options for applying ecological design as a planning and problem-solving framework. The paper concludes that design-based approaches offer significant opportunities for using ecological science to integrate conservation and production in agricultural landscapes in ways that can meet human needs while also conserving biodiversity under climate change."

"The effect of different treatment strategies on Cardicola spp. (Trematoda: Aporocotylidae) infection in ranched Southern Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) from Port Lincoln, South Australia Opecoelidae; Digenea (Trematoda); Animals The aporocotylids Cardicola forsteri and C. orientalis are considered one of the most significant health concerns for Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) ranched off Port Lincoln, South Australia. In this study we compared the effects of different treatment strategies on blood fluke infections in ranched SBT by sampling from one untreated and two praziquantel treated pontoons progressively throughout the 2018 season. Severity of infection was assessed relative to a number of criteria including adult fluke counts from hearts, egg counts from gill filaments and the use of specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for detection of C. forsteri and C. orientalis ITS-2 DNA in SBT hearts and gills. Cardicola forsteri was the dominant species detected in this study, and intensity of C. forsteri infection in SBT was significantly higher in the untreated pontoon than the two treated pontoons from week 8 of ranching. Cardicola orientalis in SBT was rarely detected, and no significant differences were seen in mortalities or condition of SBT between pontoons. Comparing diagnostic methods for C. forsteri in SBT heart demonstrated qPCR as the gold standard. This study provides important insights into the continued efficacy of praziquantel on blood fluke infections in ranched SBT."

"Developing sustainable, high-performance perovskites in photocatalysis: Design strategies and applications Perovskite Solar Cells; Solar Cell; Formamidine Solar energy is attractive because it is free, renewable, abundant and sustainable. Photocatalysis is one of the feasible routes to utilize solar energy for the degradation of pollutants and the production of fuel. Perovskites and their derivatives have received substantial attention in both photocatalytic wastewater treatment and energy production because of their highly tailorable structural and physicochemical properties. This review illustrates the basic principles of photocatalytic reactions and the application of these principles to the design of robust and sustainable perovskite photocatalysts. It details the structures of the perovskites and the physics and chemistry behind photocatalytic reactions and describes the advantages and limitations of popular strategies for the design of photoactive perovskites. This is followed by examples of how these strategies are applied to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of oxide, halide and oxyhalide perovskites, with a focus on materials with potential for practical application, that is, not containing scarce or toxic elements. It is expected that this overview of the development of photocatalysts and deeper understanding of photocatalytic principles will accelerate the exploitation of efficient perovskite photocatalysts and bring about effective solutions to the energy and environmental crisis."

To reduce the delay caused by separate movements of the linear motor and piezoelectric actuator, a new control algorithm was developed to synchronize the movements of the motor and piezoelectric actuator. A fuzzy control system was used to control the feeding process. Piezoelectric actuator position and its speed were selected as the fuzzy inputs, while the fuzzy output was the linear motor speed. Cutting experiments were conducted, and results show that the fuzzy system is more powerful than the conventional algorithm and the new algorithm with constant motor speed. An increase in material removal rate of 1.6 times was achieved using the proposed fuzzy control algorithm."

"Reprint of: A MACEing silicon: Towards single-step etching of defined porous nanostructures for biomedicine Silicon Nanowires; Silicon; Etching Metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) affords porous silicon nanostructures control over size, shape, and porosity in a single step. Simplicity and flexibility are potential advantages over more traditional silicon bulk micromachining techniques. MACE-generated porous micro- and nanostructures are suitable as biomaterials through their length scales and biocompatibility. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the MACE reaction mechanism that yields biomedically relevant silicon nanostructures â€“ from nanowires, nanopillars, to sub-micrometer holes and pores. We discuss their biomedical applications in biosensors, cell capture and transfection arrays, and drug delivery vectors. We assess the reported benefits of the various nanostructures and discuss whether MACE provides clear and distinct advantages over other techniques. The flexibility and simplicity of MACE comes at a cost. The reaction parameters are many and inter-related, and we lack a full model of the etching mechanism. While the cathode reaction is well understood, the anode reaction involving dissolution of the silicon remains controversial. Such uncertainties impede rational design of specific structures that address biomedical requirements. We summarize current understanding to provide design guidelines for structures used in biomedicine and review the effects of key parameters on the morphological attributes of the etched features."

"Are we there yet? Feminist approaches in information science Library Science; Information Science Profession; Partridges Introduction. Thirty years ago Librarianship: The Erosion of a Womanâ€™s Profession (1992) provided a clarion call for specific, radical approaches to the field in what Harris deemed might be a new return to earlier interactions of information science as a female profession. Harris offered clear guidelines to reinvigorate the field that have not been fully addressed. Method. This research presents two cases, leadership and data science, to examine persistent inequities in the field. Analysis. Inequities in leadership and data science are analysed through selected literature on data science and leadership in Information Science. Results. A feminist approach to information science is identified as a way forward in addressing issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion; to contend with missed opportunities; and to begin the work of redressing power in the field. Conclusions A thorough feminist analysis and interdisciplinary research partnerships are suggested as ways to identify opportunities for change and ways to create a field that is truly our own.."

"Easy Nutrient There is increasing concern regarding the negative health impacts from sub optimal diets, particularly diets low in fruit and vegetables. These concerns relate to the insufficient intake of the plant-based nutrients, which provide protective health benefits such as antioxidant activities and are highly nutritious. The project aims to develop an easy to use nutrient-rich product/formulation to support at-home growth of fruit and vegetable foods through easy-to-use kitchen-top hydroponic plant systems and thereby promote the intake of healthy fruits and vegetables. The ease of use and scalability of the new products will promote increased productivity of food production, as the novel user-friendly designs will encourage broader engagement in at-home food production."

"Hydrogen as a long-term large-scale energy storage solution to support renewables Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems This paper presents a case study of using hydrogen for large-scale long-term storage application to support the current electricity generation mix of South Australia state in Australia, which primarily includes gas, wind and solar. For this purpose two cases of battery energy storage and hybrid battery-hydrogen storage systems to support solar and wind energy inputs were compared from a techno-economical point of view. Hybrid battery-hydrogen storage system was found to be more cost competitive with unit cost of electricity at $0.626/kWh (US dollar) compared to battery-only energy storage systems with a $2.68/kWh unit cost of electricity. This research also found that the excess stored hydrogen can be further utilised to generate extra electricity. Further utilisation of generated electricity can be incorporated to meet the load demand by either decreasing the base load supply from gas in the present scenario or exporting it to neighbouring states to enhance economic viability of the system. The use of excess stored hydrogen to generate extra electricity further reduced the cost to $0.494/kWh."

"Agricultural groundwater with high nitrates and dissolved salts given to pregnant mice alters brain development in the offspring Inorganic Nitrates; Nitric Oxide; Nitrites Groundwater is the main source of drinking water for a significant portion of the human population. In many agricultural areas, diffuse pollution such as high levels of total dissolved salts including nitrate, puts the quality of this resource at risk. However, the effect of exposure to these water contaminants on brain development is currently poorly understood. Here we characterised water from a borewell located in an intensely cultivated area (agricultural) or water from a borewell located in a nearby pristine forest. The agricultural borewell water was rich in nitrates with high total dissolved salts. We then studied the consequence of drinking the agricultural water on mouse brain development. For this, the agricultural borewell water or forest water was given to mice for 6 weeks before and during pregnancy and lactation. The brains of the offspring born to these dams were analysed at postnatal day (P)5 and P21 and compared using immunohistochemistry for changes in glial cells, neurons, myelin, and cell death across many brain regions. Brains from offspring born to dams who had been given agricultural water (versus forest control water) were significantly smaller, and at P21 had a significant degeneration of neurons and increased numbers of microglia in the motor cortex, had fewer white matter astrocytes and an increase in cell death, particularly in the dentate gyrus. This study shows that brain development is sensitive to water composition. It points to the importance of assessing neurodevelopmental delays when considering the effect of water contaminated with agricultural run offs on human health. Main finding: Pregnant and lactating mice were given borewell water from intensely cultivated land. Offspring brains reveal degeneration of neurons and a loss of astrocytes, increase in microglial cells and cell death, pointing to neurodevelopmental problems."
"Counting the Costs of Public Housing Estate Redevelopment in Melbourne: A comparison of delivery options Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Since 2001, social housing levels, traditionally a safety net for low-income households, have stagnated in Victoria. To increase social housing levels, the Victorian state government announced a programme to redevelop ageing public housing estates through publicâ€“private partnerships. This study compares private sector, community housing sector, and government-led redevelopment models, to determine which provides the best value for money method of redevelopment. Importantly, considering the Victorian governmentâ€™s plans to increase social housing levels post-COVID19, the study found that the government is best placed to deliver social housing, due, in part, to lower borrowing costs and no requirement for making profit."

"Using indigenous terrestrial micro-invertebrates to assess environmental impacts of soil pollution in Antarctica. Previous waste disposal practices and current human activities in Antarctica have resulted in a number of contaminated sites. To assess, mitigate and remediate these sites an understanding is required of how native organisms respond to contamination. Terrestrial micro-invertebrates play key roles in ecosystem processes (e.g. nutrient cycling) but little is known about the responses of Antarctic species to pollutants. This project will assess the responses of key micro-invertebrates from East Antarctica (e.g. nematodes, rotifers, tardigrades) to hydrocarbon and metal pollution in soils. It will be the first Antarctic project to assess the impact of soil characteristics and freeze-thaw cycles on contaminant toxicity and the effectiveness of the Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon test in measuring toxicity. Data from this work will contribute to development of guidelines for site assessment, management and remediation, aimed at protecting Australia's Antarctic Territory."

"Review: Trends in point-of-care diagnosis for Escherichia coli O157:H7 in food and water Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification; Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques; Magnesium Pyrophosphate Escherichia coli O157:H7, a Shiga-producing E. coli is a major pathogenic E. coli strain which since the early 1980s has become a crucial food and water-borne pathogen. Several management strategies can be applied to control the spread of infection; however early diagnosis represents the optimum preventive strategy to minimize the infection. Therefore, it is crucial to detect this pathogen in a fast and efficient manner in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality. Currently used gold standard tests rely on culture and pre-enrichment of E. coli O157:H7 from the contaminated source; they are time consuming and laborious. Molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction are sensitive; however, they require expensive instrumentation. Therefore, there is a requirement for Accurate, Sensitive, Specific, User friendly, Rapid, Equipment free and Deliverable (ASSURED) detection methods for use in the laboratory and in the field. Emerging technologies such as isothermal amplification methods, biosensors, surface enhanced Raman Spectroscopy, paper-based diagnostics and smartphone-based digital methods are recognized as new approaches in the field of E. coli O157:H7 diagnostics and are discussed in this review. Mobile PCR and CRISPR-Cas diagnostic platforms have been identified as new tools in E. coli O157:H7 POC diagnostics with the potential for implementation by industry. This review describes advances and progress in the field of E. coli O157:H7 diagnosis in the context of food and water industry. The focus is on emerging high throughput point-of-care (POC) E. coli O157:H7 diagnostics and the requirement for the transformation to service routine diagnostics in the food and water industry."

"Protestantism and energy poverty Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort There is growing interest in the causes of energy poverty. This study examines the relationship between Protestantism and energy poverty. Employing household panel data for Australia, our preferred estimates, which account for endogeneity of Protestantism, suggest that being Protestant is associated with a 1.7 percentage point decrease in the probability that a respondent is in energy poverty based on Low-Income High Cost and a 2.4 percentage point decrease in the probability that a respondent is unable to heat their home. This result is robust to alternative ways to addressing endogeneity, alternative specifications and other checks. We also find that Locus of Control, income, hours worked, and social capital are channels through which Protestantism lowers the likelihood of being in energy poverty. Our findings shed new light on how cultural, and specifically religious, beliefs influence the proclivity to be in energy poverty and may assist policymakers to identify ways to help reduce the incidence of energy poverty."
"‘Just transition’? Conceptual challenges meet stark reality in a ‘transitioning’ coal region in Australia Tobacco Control; Excise Tax; Nicotiana Tabacum â€˜Just transitionâ€™ (JT) is an increasingly popular concept developed by unions and adopted and adapted by academics, environmentalists, government and non-governmental organizations, and international institutions in recognition of the need to address social concerns and inequities emerging from efforts to address environmental problems. It has been noted, however, that â€˜JTâ€™ lacks both conceptual clarity and empirical evidence of its practical applications. This paper examines the â€˜theoryâ€™ and practice of â€˜JTâ€™ by first considering the competing interpretations and conceptual understandings of â€˜JTâ€™ and second, the challenges of realizing a â€˜JTâ€™ in an Australian coal region where transition is occurring. The paper argues that achieving â€˜JTâ€™ requires more than government provisions and interventions and that unions must perform an active part in the â€˜JTâ€™ process through their relations with employers, workers, government, and community. It suggests the lack of clarity within the â€˜JTâ€™ literature may be the conceptâ€™s lasting strength."
"Tweeting for their lives: Visibility of threatened species on twitter Endangered Species Act; Environmental Protection; Tympanuchus Pallidicinctus Unpopular and uncharismatic species receive less conservation support, potentially impacting their long-term survival. This study assesses the attention directed towards Australian threatened species on the online social network Twitter, an increasingly common way for scientists and the general public to communicate about conservation. We find a difference in how often Twitter users mention (i.e. â€œtweetâ€) threatened species across different taxa and find that many threatened species are not mentioned at all. As expected, mammals and birds receive the most tweets, with invertebrates and frogs receiving less attention. Threatened species with recovery plans are more likely to be tweeted about than those without. Alarmingly, the majority of threatened species receive little interest on Twitter, indicating the public profile of these species is low. We identify five traits shared by popular threatened species on Twitter and suggest understanding these commonalities can inform conservation education and marketing campaigns aiming to raise the profile of less popular threatened species."

"Centering gender on the agenda for environmental education research Educational Research; Relationality; Ecofeminism The environmental education movement developed in the 1970s at the same time as the environment movement, the feminist movement and the ecofeminist movement. However, while environmental education feels a close affinity with the environment movement the relationship with the (eco)feminist movement in environmental education research has been less than robust. Although there was some feminist environmental education research in the 1990s and 2000s, until the two recent special issues of The Journal of Environmental Education there had been a prolonged, even a deafening, silence around gender, eco/feminism and environmental education research. This article traces the history of feminist environmental education research across this and other environmental education research journals to argue that it is time for gender to be much higher on the agenda of environmental education researchers and of journals if we are to better achieve gender equality and more fully address the climate emergency within the field."

"Treatment of Industrial Wastewater in a Floating Treatment Wetland: A Case Study of Sialkot Tannery Constructed Wetlands; Waste Water; Nitrogen Removal The city of Sialkot in Pakistan is a hub of leather tanneries, with approximately 260 tanneries in operation and, while producing millions of leather products per day, the city discharges millions of gallons of untreated effluent into drains each day. In order to devise a cost-effective system for the treatment of tannery wastewater, a floating treatment wetland (FTW) was established to treat the effluent using local plant species through phytoremediation. The efficiency of the FTW was tested with three different plant species, each grown separately and operating for three months in the FTW tank. Two of the plant species introduced, water hyacinth and water lettuce, were floating and vascular; the third plant species Typha latifolia was vegetated on a floating mat of styrofoam while the roots extended down to the contaminated water. Wastewater from a tannery drain was pumped into the FTW tank with a flow of 0.5 L per minute and was given a retention time of six days. The influent and effluent from the FTW were periodically tested to determine the percentage removal of contaminants, primarily the total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and chromium. After two months with each species, a significant change in the quality of wastewater was measured: chromium was removed by up to 95 percent by the water hyacinth and water lettuce and 33 percent by the Typha latifolia. The pilot model indicates that FTWs are an effective system to treat effluent from tanneries in a cost-effective way as an alternative to establishing an expensive treatment system with high associated operational costs. It can help in achieving the circular economy concept of conventional wastewater schemes towards more sustainable ones. Moreover, to achieve the principles of circular economy and environmentally friendly development, it is crucial that the substances used for a wetland foundation have the capacity to be recycled, are available at a cheap price, and are locally available."

"The History of Antibiotics Illumes the Future of Antimicrobial Peptides Administered Through Nanosystems Anti-Bacterial Agents; Polypeptide Antibiotic Agent; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides The discovery of antibiotics in the early nineteenth century and their introduction in the 1940s into clinical practice has revolutionised the global healthcare system. Infectious diseases were controlled, various medical procedures became attainable and the pharmaceutical industry greatly benefited. However, the indiscriminate overuse of these antibiotics has contributed to an emerging bacterial resistance. Hence, it encouraged the search for new antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and nano-drug delivery systems, which can leverage these bioactive therapeutics with a tuneable controlled delivery system for clinical use against microbial infections. This review presents a brief history on the treatment of infectious diseases during the pre-antibiotic era, the golden era of conventional antibiotics, the emergence of the superbugs, and the surge in the AMP research and pharmaceutical exploration to offer a new class of pharmacotherapy through a wide range of different nano-vehicles as alternative options for antibiotics to treat various infectious diseases."

"The relationship between sustainable development practices and financial performance: A case study of textile firms in Vietnam Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy Sustainable development practices have become very important for firms to go beyond short-term profitability, towards economic, environmental and social sustainability. This research aims to examine the relationship between a firm's sustainable development practices and its financial performance. Modelled as a multidimensional construct, sustainable development practices are represented by environmental practices, social practices in the workplace and social practices in the community, while financial performance is determined by profitability and growth. Using a mixed method survey, data were obtained from 389 textile firms in Vietnam, where there is a dire need to promote sustainable and environmental practices. Data analysis using partial least squares structural equation modeling demonstrates that sustainable development practices positively affect financial performance directly and indirectly via customer loyalty, employee satisfaction and corporate reputation. The findings also reveal the moderating role of entrepreneurial orientation, whereby the impact of sustainable development practices on financial performance is stronger for firms that are more innovative, proactive and willing to take risks. Taken together, these findings provide support for firms to holistically implement sustainable development practices and adopt an entrepreneurial orientation."
"Within-city dwelling price growth and convergence: trends from Australia’s large cities Home Ownership; Housing Tenure; Real Estate Market Within Australiaâ€™s larger cities, we observe differences in price dynamics across different sub-periods over the period 2001â€“2016. A combination of housing market cycles, policy reforms and different new supply configurations offers potential explanations. Neighbourhood dwelling prices within all cities and dwelling types converged during a 2001â€“2006 sub-period that coincided with strong housing price growth. Shifts in monetary policy as well as tax and housing policy reforms drove this convergence by boosting demand from first homebuyers and investors. Divergence had overtaken convergence in most cities and market segments by the final 2011â€“2016 sub-period. We argue that falling interest rates were responsible. The findings highlight how price indices based on movements in central measures of the price distribution can offer a poor guide to housing affordability trends at different points in a cityâ€™s neighbourhood price distribution. They also suggest that monetary policy has differential effects across market segments. These effects are markedly different in periods when monetary policy is relaxed rather than tightened, and have important implications for first homebuyer accessibility and the ability of existing homeowners to trade up."

"Ultrasound applications in textiles and apparels Dyeing; Ultrasound; Disperse Red 167 Textile sector plays a key role in global economy, but these are associated with environmental pollution having involvement of toxic chemicals and their discharge in effluent. Beside these, textile industries, especially textile wet processing, consume huge amount of chemicals, water, and energy. Thus, there is acute need to find out pertinent solution in the same concern. Ultrasound is sound wave beyond 20 kHz and forms microbubbles in solution via cavitation phenomenon. The cavitation phenomenon creates microjets, and shock waves facilitate micromixing, blending, and mass transfer in chemical reaction. In cavitation phenomenon, microbubbles appear, grow, and oscillate as well as collapse at rapid rate causing generation of high temperature and high pressure inside or in nearby vicinity of microbubbles. The aforesaid properties of ultrasound have numerous applications in various industries such as medical, textile, plastic and metal, agriculture, food and packaging, electronic devices, aerospace and aviation, architectures, etc., along with applications in process control, temperature monitoring, medical imagining, construction, high resolution spectroscopy, etc."

"Recycling steel slag from municipal wastewater treatment plants into concrete applications – A step towards circular economy Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption Municipal wastewater is a major source of the release of phosphorus into the marine environment, and its excessive release could negatively impact marine flora and fauna. In this study, steel slag a by-product from steel industry was used to remove phosphorus content from the municipal wastewater. The Langmuir isotherm model revealed a maximum adsorption capacity of 3.8 mg phosphate/g of steelmaking slag. The results showed that the phosphate removal efficiency of granular slag was about 90%. The wastewater contained a significant amount of iron and manganese content that was filtered out by the slag granules. X-ray fluorescence and x-ray diffraction analysis show that the wastewater treatment process changes the chemical phase composition of slag in addition to the absorption/adsorption of various chemicals within its pore structure. To recycle this waste slag after the water treatment process, that significantly altered its chemical and mineralogical composition, it was used in concrete as a replacement of conventional coarse aggregates. The results show that the treated slag aggregates provide compressive strength improvement of 32.5% and 18% at 7 days and 8.2 and 16.8% improvement at 28 days compared to that of raw slag and conventional aggregates, respectively. In addition, due to the pozzolanic nature of slag both the raw and treated slag aggregates showed a seamless monolithic bond at the interfacial transition zone between the slag and the cement matrix. This study demonstrates that the waste slag generated from the wastewater treatment process has a great potential to be used as a replacement of conventional aggregates in concrete applications."

"Experience learning from low-carbon pilot provinces in China: Pathways towards carbon neutrality Divisia Index; Logarithmic Mean; Carbon Emissions As one of the largest carbon emitters worldwide, China has promised to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve national carbon neutrality by 2060. In order to achieve the carbon reduction goal, the low-carbon pilot (LCP) program has been implemented in China since 2010. It is particularly significant to recognise the effectiveness of the LCP program and learn valuable experience from these LCP provinces. Therefore, this study develops a systemic experience learning approach by analysing the evolution of carbon footprint (CF) and net carbon footprint (NCF) and investigating the impact factors in representative LCP provinces. The results demonstrated that the CF of nine LCP provinces showed an upward trend from 2006 to 2015, and the NCF of eight provinces was larger than 0 except for Yunnan province, with a negative NCF. The implementation of the LCP program is effective since the average annual growth rates of CF and NCF in pilot provinces were significantly lower after they were selected as LCP provinces. Based on the identified four impact factors of CF (i.e., population, GDP per capita, industrial structure, and technology), the low-carbon experience with regional characteristics can be summarised and shared with other regions throughout the country. Accordingly, targeted guidelines are put forward from the perspectives of policy, industry structure, population, and carbon uptake. This study not only develops a new experience learning approach incorporating the regional characteristics but also provides effective pathways towards carbon neutrality."

"Trends in bioaccumulation and metabolite profiles in Mediterranean mussels with sub lethal exposure to mixtures of trace metals Zinc Transporter; Znaf-2; Neuron Trace metals are major environmental contaminants, and the accumulation of trace metals could cause changes to the metabolism of marine organisms. In order to understand trends in bioaccumulation and changes in metabolic pathways in marine mussels during short-term and long-term exposure to trace metal mixtures, wild Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were exposed to natural seawater spiked with two sub lethal concentrations of a mixture of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and lead (Pb) for 30 days. Mussels were collected every 5 days and trace metal levels in the whole bodies were measured. The gills of mussels collected on day 5 and day 30 were sampled separately. Trace metal levels in whole bodies of these samples were measured and metabolites in the gill tissue extracted, profiled, identified, and compared between groups with different exposure time and trace metal levels. The results showed continuous increase in body burdens of Cu and Pb in mussels throughout the exposure period, while Zn accumulation reached a plateau after day 10 in the whole body and gills. The metabolomics analysis demonstrated that multiple metabolites were down-regulated and multiple metabolic pathways possibly interrupted by exposure to the mixture of trace metals. This study provides extensive knowledge that the effects of Cu, Zn, and Pb exposure on the metabolic pathways have the potential to result in reduced fitness of Mediterranean mussels and demonstrates potential of GC-MS based untargeted metabolomics to be used as a part of trace metal pollution evaluation and ecosystem health monitoring."
"Hearing loss prevalence and years lived with disability, 1990-2019: Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 Hearing Aids; Very Elderly; Auditory Training Background: Hearing loss affects access to spoken language, which can affect cognition and development, and can negatively affect social wellbeing. We present updated estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study on the prevalence of hearing loss in 2019, as well as the condition's associated disability. Methods: We did systematic reviews of population-representative surveys on hearing loss prevalence from 1990 to 2019. We fitted nested meta-regression models for severity-specific prevalence, accounting for hearing aid coverage, cause, and the presence of tinnitus. We also forecasted the prevalence of hearing loss until 2050. Findings: An estimated 1Â·57 billion (95% uncertainty interval 1Â·51â€“1Â·64) people globally had hearing loss in 2019, accounting for one in five people (20Â·3% [19Â·5â€“21Â·1]). Of these, 403Â·3 million (357Â·3â€“449Â·5) people had hearing loss that was moderate or higher in severity after adjusting for hearing aid use, and 430Â·4 million (381Â·7â€“479Â·6) without adjustment. The largest number of people with moderate-to-complete hearing loss resided in the Western Pacific region (127Â·1 million people [112Â·3â€“142Â·6]). Of all people with a hearing impairment, 62Â·1% (60Â·2â€“63Â·9) were older than 50 years. The Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index explained 65Â·8% of the variation in national age-standardised rates of years lived with disability, because countries with a low HAQ Index had higher rates of years lived with disability. By 2050, a projected 2Â·45 billion (2Â·35â€“2Â·56) people will have hearing loss, a 56Â·1% (47Â·3â€“65Â·2) increase from 2019, despite stable age-standardised prevalence. Interpretation: As populations age, the number of people with hearing loss will increase. Interventions such as childhood screening, hearing aids, effective management of otitis media and meningitis, and cochlear implants have the potential to ameliorate this burden. Because the burden of moderate-to-complete hearing loss is concentrated in countries with low health-care quality and access, stronger health-care provision mechanisms are needed to reduce the burden of unaddressed hearing loss in these settings.

"Digitalizing agriculture extension service in Ethiopia: A design-reality gap analysis Cell Phone Use; Market Information; Agriculture Recent research shows that information systems (IS) developed to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and their farming practices have experienced mixed levels of success. As such, an evaluation of contextual factors and the socio-technical requirements of agricultural IS is needed to fully understand the challenges of digitalizing agriculture extension information service (AEIS) in developing countries. We examine the socio-technical design and reality features of an AEIS that was intended to digitalize AEIS in Ethiopia. Conceptually, we use Bass and Heeks's (2011) design-reality framework to unravel the changing socio-technical design requirements and, empirically we draw from a qualitative case study of an existing AEIS. The findings show gaps between the designed artefact and the lived experiences of stakeholders' activities, and the need to shift from a simplistic approach that focuses on providing access to digital content and devices to a balanced approach that addresses socio-technical requirements while digitalizing the public AEIS."

"Producing fit-for-purpose water and recovering resources from various sources: An overview Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production Natural resources, except wind power and solar energy, are depleting, and therefore it is essential to develop and implement best management practices wherever possible. With respect to water, integrated water management is essential to preserve the fresh water for many generations to come. Producing fit-for-purpose water from various sources such as rainwater, wastewater, seawater/brackish water, and stormwater will contribute greatly to conserve the fresh water. By looking at a few wastewater streams, such as domestic wastewater and wastewaters from industries such as textile, aquaculture, mining, meat processing, carwash, and agriculture, generated all over the world informs us that quantifying them and characterizing their qualities are important to understand many aspects. The increase or decrease in consumption and technologies implemented (or need to be implemented) for water and energy savings, recovery of energy and resources from concentrates and other wastes (such as wastewater sludge, agricultural and food wastes) to reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover materials and energy will give clear direction that should be taken in research and development and implementation of technologies for sustainable living."

"Renewable energy in Bangladesh: current situation and future prospect Energy; Energy Poverty; Fuelwood Energy insufficiency is obstructing the socio-economic and industrial improvement of Bangladesh. Renewable energy contributes about 560 Megawatt (MW) of the total electricity production of 20,430 MW, which can be a sustainable solution to the demand-supply crisis. This paper, summarises the current energy situation of Bangladesh and examines the available renewable energy resources and their future prospect. It has been revealed that Bangladesh is heavily (62%) relying on natural gas although government has already taken steps to generate electricity from renewable energy sources. Current policies and legislations related to generation of renewable energy in Bangladesh have been discussed explicitly. Finally, some suggestions have been made to tackle the ongoing energy crisis in the country, in addition to the renewable energy.Abbreviations: GDP: Gross domestic product; RNPP: Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant; Tcf: Trillion cubic feet; IDCOL: Infrastructure development company limited; BPDB: Bangladesh Power Development Board: GS: Grameen Shakti; BWDB: Bangladesh Water Development Board: USD: United States Dollar; IPP: Independent power producer: BCAS: Bangladesh center for advanced studies; NWPGCL: North West Power Generation Company Limited: BCSIR: Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research; EGCB: Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh: WRA: Wind Resource Assessment; REB: Rural Electrification Board: BRAC: Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee; kW: Kilowatt: PJ: Petajoules; MW: Megawatt: IFRAD: Institute for fuel research and Development; GWh: Gigawatt hours: ICS: Improved Cooking Stoves; MWh: Megawatt hours: DoE: Department of Environment; TWh: Trillion-watt hour: DLS: Department of Livestock Services; RPCL: Rural Power Company Limited: mmcfd: million cubic feet per day; APSCL: Ashugang Power Station Company Limited: BSCIC: Bangladesh Small & Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC); GOB: Government of Bangladesh: BADC: Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation; SREDA: Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority: DIDA: Danish International Development Agency; LGED: Local Government Engineering Directorate: BAU: Bangladesh Agricultural University; NGO: Non-Governmental Organization: HBRI: Housing & Building Research Institute; IRENA: International Renewable energy Agency: : BARD: Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development; ETP: Electronic Traffic Pricing: BCCD: Bangladesh Commission for Christian Development; PV: Photovoltaic: BRRI: Bangladesh Rice Research Institute; SHS: Solar Home Systems: NDBMP: National Domestic Biogas and Manure Program; TOE: Tonne of oil equivalent: K/km: Kelvin/kilometer; LEAP: Long range Energy Alternative Planning."

"Fire frequency analysis for different climatic stations in Victoria, Australia Flood Frequency; L-Moment; Catchment Area (Hydrology) Frequent occurrence of fire events will have severe impact on Victoriaâ€™s water supply catchments. Hence, it is important to perform fire frequency analysis to obtain fire frequency curves (FFC) on fire intensity using Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) at different parts of Victoria. FFDI is a measure of fire initiation, spreading speed and containment difficulty. FFC will guide water harvesting by providing information with regard to future fire events and the subsequent impact on catchment yield. Five probability distributions, namely normal, Log Pearson Type III (LPIII), gamma, log-normal and Weibull distributions were used for the development of FFCs at ten selected meteorological stations spread all over Victoria. LPIII distribution was identified as the best fit distribution for Victoria and subsequently applied for an additional 30 more stations to show spatial variability for the entire Victoria."

"A proton flow reactor system for large-scale electrical energy storage and bulk export of hydrogenated carbon based material In this project we are developing an integrated system for medium and grid-scale storage of renewable energy and exporting it as hydrogen within hydrogenated carbon-based media. A novel `proton flow reactor? system for producing hydrogenated carbon(C)-based powder for bulk export will be developed. The reactor employs electricity from renewables to charge a flowing `slurry electrode? of C-particles with hydrogen. Hydrogen, as protons, is obtained by water splitting. Solid hydrogenated C-powder for storage and transport is generated by removing the liquid. At the destination, this C-powder is reconverted into a slurry and passed through a similar reactor operating in `fuel-cell? mode to re-generate electricity. This system will be a scaled-up form of RMIT?s novel proton battery ? a reversible PEM fuel cell that reversibly stores protons in its solid electrode without forming hydrogen gas. The technical feasibility of a proton battery with an activated carbon electrode has recently been proven by the RMIT team. Importantly the system may open up an alternative market for Australian coal that has no adverse greenhouse gas impact. The efficiency and levelised cost of delivered energy will be assessed, and a roadmap for scale-up and commercialisation developed."
"A study of sustainable practices in the sustainability leadership of international contractors Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative With an increasing global need for sustainable development, numerous world-leading construction corporations have devoted significant efforts to implementing sustainable practices. However, few previous studies have shared these valuable experiences in a systematic and quantitative way. RobecoSAM has published The Sustainability Yearbook annually since 2004, which lists the sustainability leaders in various industries, including the construction industry. Learning from those sustainability leaders in the construction industry can provide useful references for construction-related companies when developing their sustainable development strategies. Based on a comprehensive literature review, this paper identified 51 methods used for improving sustainability performance and 34 outcomes achieved via these methods. These methods and outcomes are used for coding the sustainable practices of sustainability leaders in the construction sector. Using the coding system, 133 annual sustainability reports issued by 22 sustainability leaders (The Sustainability Yearbook, RobecoSAM 2010â€“2016) in the construction sector were analyzed using content analysis. Social network analysis was then employed to identify the key adopted methods and achieved outcomes (KAMAO) of these leaders. The dynamic trend and regional analysis of KAMAO are also presented. These KAMAO findings provide valuable guidance for international contractors to develop a better understanding of the primary sustainable methods adopted by sustainability leaders in the construction sector and the top outcomes achieved by these leaders. The findings also provide a useful reference for international contractors to evaluate their current sustainability-related strategies and make improvements."
"Entrepreneurial drivers, barriers and enablers of computing students: gendered perspectives from an Australian and UK university Entrepreneurial Intention; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship This paper investigates computing studentsâ€™ entrepreneurial intentions, motivations, recognisable barriers and encouragements towards entrepreneurship, with a focus on gender. Two universities, one in Australia and one in the UK (n = 247), were used as locations for the research to consider two distinct contexts. In each university there were similarly high levels of interest in entrepreneurship among computing students, however some significant differences in responses were found, especially between male and female participants. Job flexibility was a strong motivation for the UK-based female participants; while female participants at the Australian university identified internal barriers (such as lack of confidence and experience). Enablers to entrepreneurial activity were identified, including access to incubators and academic support. Directing such support towards computing students, while recognising gender differences, could increase interest in, and take-up of, entrepreneurship. Recommendations are made regarding how universities can best support would-be entrepreneurs and encourage inclusive entrepreneurship into the future."

"Performance evaluation of weak subgrade soil under increased surcharge weight Saudi Arabia; Indian Ocean; Halite This research investigated the effect of surcharge weights on California bearing ratio (CBR), resilient modulus (MR), and swell potential of subgrade soils (A-4 and A-2-4), commonly used by the road construction industry. Nine different surcharge weights ranging from 2.27 kg to 20.75 kg were applied on both soil samples. The swelling was determined after soaking for 96 h, and the ultrasonic pulse velocity technique was used to determine the MR. CBR values for A-4 and A-2-4 soil increased from 3.5-23% to 18.5%-43.6%, respectively with increasing surcharge weight from 2.27 to 20.75 kg. A-4 soil showed decrease in swelling from 1.30% to 0.14% by increasing surcharge weight from 2.27 to 20.75 kg. The MR values of for A-4 and A-2-4 soil also increased from 35 to 135 MPa and 299â€“525 MPa, respectively with increasing surcharge weight from 2.27 to 20.75 kg. The MR values obtained through the ultrasonic pulse velocity technique, when compared with the CBR values, showed that the general equation of CBR-MR relationship developed by Garber and Hoel in 2015 overestimates the MR values of A-4 soil and underestimates the MR values of A-2-4 soil; Moreover, same CBR -MR equation cannot be used for all types of subgrade soils."
"Effect of nano-silica addition into high volume fly ash–hydrated lime blended concrete Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali This study investigates strength development, reactivity and environmental/economic benefits of blended High Volume Fly Ash (HVFA) concrete mixes utilizing 65% and 80% cement replacement utilizing a combination of fly ash and hydrated lime, with and without nano-silica. The carbon and non-carbon emissions are considered as environmental impacts while life cycle costs from cradle-to-gate, which is from material extraction to production, are considered for comparison of the economic benefits. The compressive strength of the HVFA mixes increased with the addition of nano-silica. The HVFAâ€“65 and HVFAâ€“80, without nano-silica, achieved 25.0 MPa and 14.5 MPa at 7 days, respectively, and 42.7 MPa and 29.5 MPa at 28 days. With the addition of nano-silica the HVFAâ€“65 ns and HVFAâ€“80 ns concrete had compressive strengths of 37.5 MPa and 28.8 MPa at 7 days and increased to 47.1 MPa and 40.1 MPa at 28 days. Incorporating 3% nano-silica into HVFA concrete increased the early age hydration reaction. This is attributed to the reaction of the C3A and C4AF phases and the formation of monosulfoaluminate, which contributed to the early age strength gain. The majority of Ca2+ ions were consumed during the initial hydration, with few Ca2+ ions remaining for the subsequent hydration reaction with the C3S phase. The HVFA concrete mixes displayed between 51 and 60 % carbon savings and a reduced Global Warming Impact. The non-Greenhouse Gas emissions, i.e. SO2 and NOx, reflects minor savings in the Acidification Impact (AI) and Photochemical Oxidant Formation Impact (POFI) environmental impact indicators. Further, HVFA concrete incorporated with hydrated lime shows a 10% cost reduction compared with Portland Cement concrete."
"How does traditional knowledge of Cassiae semen shed light on weight management? – A classical and modern literature review Senna Obtusifolia; Anthraquinone; Rubrofusarin Ethnopharmacological relevance: The seed of Senna obtusifolia (L.) H. S. Irwin & Barneby (Cassiae semen, CS) also known as Jue ming zi in China, has been traditionally used for weight management by purging the liver and improving the liver functions to support digestion. In the past decades, it has been used for hepatoprotection and treatment of overweight and other metabolic disorders such as hyperlipidaemia and diabetes. Aim of the review: This review aimed at providing comprehensive information on the traditional usages, pharmacology, phytochemistry and toxicology of CS and critically exploring its potential usage for clinical weight management from both traditional and modern application perspectives. Materials and methods: In order to fully understand the properties, actions and indications of CS, two sets of Chinese classical texts were searched, namely: Zhong Hua Yi Dian (Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine) and Zhong Guo Ben Cao Quan Shu (Complete Collection of Traditional Texts on Chinese Materia Medica). The purpose of studying these classical texts was to determine the traditional use of CS in weight management. Comprehensive searches were also performed on seven databases for publications on original randomised clinical trials (RCT), in vivo, in vitro or in silico studies related to pharmacological effects of CS. Detailed information about the phytochemistry of CS was collected from books, encyclopedia, online databases and journal literature. Findings: In classical literature review, 89 classic texts provided information of properties, actions and indications of CS. In modern literature review, 44 studies were included for analysis, including 5 RCTs, 7 in vivo studies, 14 in vitro studies, 2 in silico studies and 16 studies of mixed types. Chinese classic literature has provided traditional evidence of the usage of CS for weight management. Contemporary studies have revealed that CS has weight loss effects and possesses some other pharmacological activities supporting weight management. Some chemical compounds of CS have been hypothesised to have a direct or indirect contribution to weight control. Conclusions: The relationships between chemical compounds and the corresponding weight-loss target proteins are not fully understood. Therefore, CS constituents should be further explored for the development of novel therapeutic or preventive agents for the treatment of overweight and obesity."

"Achieving the promise of integration in social-ecological research: A review and prospectus Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework An integrated understanding of both social and ecological aspects of environmental issues is essential to address pressing sustainability challenges. An integrated social-ecological systems perspective is purported to provide a better understanding of the complex relationships between humans and nature. Despite a threefold increase in the amount of social-ecological research published between 2010 and 2015, it is unclear whether these approaches have been truly integrative. We conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the conceptual, methodological, disciplinary, and functional aspects of social-ecological integration. In general, we found that overall integration is still lacking in social-ecological research. Some social variables deemed important for addressing sustainability challenges are underrepresented in social-ecological studies, e.g., culture, politics, and power. Disciplines such as ecology, urban studies, and geography are better integrated than others, e.g., sociology, biology, and public administration. In addition to ecology and urban studies, biodiversity conservation plays a key brokerage role in integrating other disciplines into social-ecological research. Studies founded on systems theory have the highest rates of integration. Highly integrative studies combine different types of tools, involve stakeholders at appropriate stages, and tend to deliver practical recommendations. Better social-ecological integration must underpin sustainability science. To achieve this potential, future social-ecological research will require greater attention to the following: the interdisciplinary composition of project teams, strategic stakeholder involvement, application of multiple tools, incorporation of both social and ecological variables, consideration of bidirectional relationships between variables, and identification of implications and articulation of clear policy recommendations."

"Mapping Scientific Concepts through Nature Play in Early Childhood Education:
Achieving Excellence in STEM through Evidence-Based Pedagogies.                     (Administered by Southern Cross) This project aims to determine how young children's (4-5 years) learning of scientific concepts can be supported through nature play. The increase of children attending kindergarten/preschool continues to rise markedly with 33g,243 Australian children enrolled. Coupled with this increase, is also the rapid surge of nature play pedagogies in kindergartens. The effectiveness though of nature play is untested,
making this the first study in the world to explicitly research nature play in early childhood education. This is significant because nature play is a core feature and tradition of early childhood education practice and pedagogy. This project will forge new knowledge about nature play pedagogies and how they can support children's scientific learning in early childhood education. Such research supports both the OLD Department of Education STEM Strategy (2016) and the National STEM Education Strategy (2016-2026) where ""it recognises the importance of a focus on STEM in the early years"" (p.5)."

"A Novel Acoustomicrofluidic Nebulization Technique Yielding New Crystallization Morphologies Supercritical Fluids; Nanocrystal; Povidone A novel acoustic microfluidic nebulization platform is demonstrated, which, due to its unique ability to access intermediate evaporation rate regimesâ€”significantly faster than that in slow solvent evaporation but considerably below that achieved in spray drying, is capable of producing novel crystal morphologies that have yet to be reported in both model inorganic and organic systems. In addition, the potential for simultaneously encapsulating single crystals within a biodegradable polymeric coating in a single simultaneous step together with the crystallization process as the solvent evaporates during nebulization is briefly shown. The platform not only has the potential to be highly scalable by employing a large number of these low-cost miniature devices in parallel to achieve industrially relevant particle production rates, but could also be advantageous over conventional spray drying in terms of energy utilization, given the tremendous efficiency associated with the high-frequency ultrasonic microdevice as well as its ambient temperature operation."

"Principals as socio-religious curators: progressive and conservative approaches in Islamic schools Psychological Practice; School Improvement; Professional Learning Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate how socio-religious dynamics influence (and are influenced by) principals in Islamic schools. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative case study took place in Semarang, Indonesia. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews with school leaders along with school site observations. To frame the study, we drew from both Indonesian and international scholarship to understand extant perspectives on the context and on the ways that principals influence socio-religious thinking and practices in schools. Findings: Findings suggested that principals' personal experiences and beliefs are central to the ways that socio-religious thinking and practices are manifest in their school. Principals practice more progressive or conservative leadership by influencing the degree to which the school is (a) an open or closed system, (b) inclusive or exclusive in their practices and (c) plural or unitary in their teaching. In making decisions along each of these continua, principals in Islamic schools â€œcurateâ€ a socio-religious educational environment. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature on principals and socio-religious dynamics in schools by discovering specific continua of practice that collectively suggest a more conservative or progressive interpretation of Islam. As this area is understudied in educational leadership, the study makes a foundational empirical contribution, suggests theoretical constructs heretofore unexplored, and advances the notion of principal as curator of educational practice."

"Determinants of AIDS knowledge among construction workers AIDS/HIV; Child Mortality; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Accurate knowledge about AIDS transmission is pivotal to combating the spread of HIV infection and the risks of re-infection. Using multiple linear regression, the determinants of AIDS knowledge were investigated in a survey of 512 site-based construction workers in the Western Cape. Over a third of survey participants indicated poor levels of AIDS knowledge. Ethnicity, level of education, employment status and acquaintance with an HIV+ person were significant in predicting AIDS knowledge. Gender, age, multiple sex partners in the preceding 3 months and condom use at last sex were not found to be significant determinants of AIDS knowledge. Workplace interventions by employers, whilst focusing on all employees, should concentrate their efforts on identifying and targeting those demographic sub-populations that are at greatest risk of having poorer levels of AIDS knowledge."
"Graphene, electrospun membranes and granular activated carbon for eliminating heavy metals, pesticides and bacteria in water and wastewater treatment processes Electrospinning; Nanofibers; Fiber Access to safe water has a significant impact on all parts of society, its growth and sustainability, both politically and socioeconomically. Consequently, the preservation of water and wastewater treatment have become a global challenge. A major contributor to water pollution is improperly or untreated industrial emissions; water resources can be contaminated with harmful pollutants, toxins or pathogenic microorganisms. Carbon's unique chemistry and its evolution due to recent advances in carbon-based technologies such as nanomaterials, offer significant potential for a variety of water purification strategies. This work details the application of carbon materials in combination with nanotechnology in the form of graphene, graphene composites, electrospun membranes and improved activated carbon in a myriad of water treatment systems with an emphasis on the removal of heavy metals, pesticides and harmful bacteria."
"Microbiological quality assessment of milk at different stages of the dairy value chain in a developing country setting Animals; Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome; Serotypes The main objective of the study was to assess the microbiological quality of milk at different stages of the dairy value chain from farm to the factory in Bangladesh. A total of 438 raw milk samples (387 from primary producers, 32 from collectors, 15 from chilling plants, 4 from local restaurants) and 95 commercially processed milk samples were collected from northern part of Bangladesh. Almost 72% (n = 280) of samples at producer level and 100% from both collectors (n = 32) and chilling plants (n = 15) were contaminated with coliforms while 57% (n = 220) of samples from producers, 91% (n = 29) of samples from collectors and 100% (n = 15) from chilling plants were contaminated with fecal coliforms. Around 31% (n = 119) of samples from producers were positive for E. coli whereas >60% (n = 20) and 100% (n = 15) samples from collectors and chilling plants, respectively were positive for E. coli. One quarter of samples from collectors were positive for B. cereus and coagulase positive staphylococci and 33% (n = 5) of samples from chilling plants were positive for both of these microorganisms. In case of commercially processed milk, 77% (n = 46) and 37% (n = 22) of pasteurized milk samples had a high aerobic plate count (APC) (104 CFU/ml) and coliform count (>10 CFU/ml), respectively. None of the samples was positive for Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter spp. Among 158 E. coli positive raw milk samples, 9% (n = 14) contained pathogenic E. coli, and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) were found to be the predominant pathotypes. Of the 23 pathogenic E. coli identified from 14 samples based on their gene contents, >95% (n = 22) were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 13% (n = 3) of isolates were resistant to â‰¥3 classes of antibiotics. Several factors including the time of milking, hygiene practices of the producers, cow breed and amount of milk produced by the cow were found to be significantly associated with high APC of milk samples. In conclusion, both raw and commercially pasteurized milk are highly contaminated with fecal organisms.

"Key steps to aid the recovery of the endangered karak (red-tailed black cockatoo) and buloke (bull oak) in south-eastern Australia The long-term aims of this project in the Wimmera region in south-eastern Australia are:
1. To support efforts to provide food for the nationally endangered karak (Red-tailed black cockatoo) (Calyptorhynchus banksiigraptogyne) in south-eastern Australia. Karak have a declining population of only 660 breeding individuals and occur only in a contiguous area of 18,000 ha in south-eastern Australia. Its food supply is seasonal seed of two stringybarks (9 months) and buloke (3 months) in a 2-4 year cycle.

2. To support efforts to augment buloke (Allocasuarina luehmannii) of the nationally endangered. `Buloke Woodlands ??.. Bioregions?. Buloke woodlands have declined by 97% due to land-clearing for agriculture and most buloke trees are now scattered in paddocks and roadsides. Seed is produced only by female trees. Karak prefer to forage in high cone-producing trees >100 years old. Food supply is a major limitation on karak populations. Unless more buloke is planted in private farms, the karak food supply will decline as older trees die."

"A Microfluidic approach to study the mechanobiology of ageing blood vessel Arterial stiffening occurring with ageing imposes increased load on the heart and is associated with the progression of cardiovascular diseases and dementia. Increased vessel stiffening has microscale effects on endothelial cells that is not understood yet. We utilise a unique microfluidic-based model of vessel with tuneable wall stiffness values to study the mechanobiology of endothelial cells under various flow dynamics and pulsatile frequencies. Using a combination of cutting-edge cellular and molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques, we will explore the signalling pathways that control endothelial responses to arterial stiffening and identify the role of
associated mechanosensitive receptors as a novel drug target."

"Emergency workers: Working with violence Workplace Violence; Nurses; Aggression This chapter discusses violence against healthcare workers, focusing on emergency department workers and paramedics. Workplace violence is becoming a major public health concern, with increased media coverage of violence against healthcare workers. Emergency department workers include nurses, doctors, porters and administrative staff. Research has shown that emergency department workers are at high risk from verbal and physical violence from patients, patient family members and visitors. Workplace violence prevention training is often designed to protect staff, patients and visitors from violent behaviour. Patient assaults are commonly attributed to alcohol and drug use, psychiatric conditions or stress induced by a crisis situation. Care for such patients can be complex and involve a number of emergency department workers treating the patient simultaneously, all increasing patient stress levels and possibly triggering a violent outburst. Emergency medical staff intention to leave may be affected by patient violence."

"Assessing the effectiveness for achieving policy objectives of land consolidation in china: Evidence from project practices in jiangsu province from 2001 to 2017 Land Consolidation; Agriculture; Cadastres Land consolidation (LC) is an important measure taken to increase the quantity and productivity of farmland while reducing land fragmentation and ensuring food security. However, long-term land consolidation project (LCP) practices are rarely analyzed to assess the effectiveness for achieving current policy objectives of LC in China. Taking the practices of LCPs in Jiangsu Province from 2001 to 2017 as a case study, we used the spatial self-related analysis, the consistency analysis, and the redundant analysis (RDA), and found that the construction scale and the investment amount of LC in Jiangsu Province displayed varying trends, and that the newly increased farmland rate is clearly divided into three stages and gradually decreases. The newly increased farmland area, the investment funds, and reserved land resources for farmlands are not spatially synchronized in Jiangsu Province. Only the positive relationship between the LC rate and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) growth rate continue to rise. The earlier stage of land consolidation projects (LCPs)â€™s practices is mainly affected by natural and social factors, and the late stage is mainly affected by economic and strategic factors. Finally, a new implementation scheme framework of LC planning has been proposed. This framework provides reference for top-level design, planning, and management of LC policies at the national level in China and other developing countries."

"Prevalence and intensity of cardicola spp. Infection in ranched southern bluefin tuna and a comparison of diagnostic methods Opecoelidae; Digenea (Trematoda); Animals The parasitic blood flukes Cardicola forsteri and C. orientalis are an ongoing health concern for Southern Bluefin Tuna Thunnus maccoyii (SBT) ranched in Australia. In this study we compared the effect of treatment, company, and ranching year on blood fluke infections in ranched SBT. SBT were sampled during the 2018 and 2019 ranching seasons from praziquantel (PZQ) treated pontoons and untreated pontoons managed by two companies. Severity of infection was diagnosed by several criteria including adult fluke counts from hearts, egg counts from gill filaments and the use of specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for detection of C. forsteri and C. orientalis ITS-2 DNA in SBT hearts and gills. PZQ treatment remains highly effective against C. forsteri infection. Prevalence and intensity of Cardicola spp. infection was lower in 2019 than 2018 for Company A in treated pontoons at week 12 and week 17 of ranching, and lower for Company A than Company B in untreated pontoons at month 5 of ranching. Results indicate re-infection may be less likely in the environment near Company A pontoons, and consistent years of treatment may have lowered the parasite load in the environment. qPCR demonstrated higher sensitivity when comparing diagnostic methods for C. forsteri in heart, and higher specificity when comparing diagnostic methods for Cardicola spp. in gills. Continuing to monitor blood fluke infections in ranched SBT can help to detect changes in drug efficacy over time and help industry to develop a best practice for treatment."

"News media representations of people receiving income support and the production of stigma power: An empirical analysis of reporting on two Australian welfare payments Stigma; Mental Patient; Stereotyping People receiving working-age income support payments are often stigmatised as morally and/or behaviourally deficient. We consider the role of the media, as a potential source of structural stigma, in perpetuating negative characterisations of people in receipt of either the Disability Support Pension (DSP) or unemployment benefits (Newstart) during a major period of welfare reform in Australia. Newspaper articles (N = 8290) that appeared in Australiaâ€™s five largest newspapers between 2001 and 2016, and referenced either payment were analysed. We found an increased use of fraud language associated with the DSP, which coincides with increased political and policy focus on this payment. We conclude that in a period of increasing political concern with welfare reform, media coverage of welfare recipients is a form of stigma power, acting discursively as symbolic violence."

"Pie in the sky: exploring food practices amongst those living in apartments within Melbourne, Australia Housing Supply; Suburban Area; Brisbane A major change is occurring in the way Australians live, as high-rise apartments are increasingly replacing low-density detached housing in Australian cities. In this piece we discuss recent pilot work undertaken that explores the links between apartment living and food practices in Melbourne, Australia. Detailed analysis is planned on this data, but we maintain the value of presenting this preliminary work as a praxis to promote the potential importance of this topic. Clarifying the relationship and unpacking the connections between apartment size, kitchen design, neighbourhood character, and food practices, will allow a set of recommendations to facilitate healthy eating which can be used by different levels of government and those concerned with public health, as well as those involved in apartment design and development and neighbourhood planning."
"Recycling cigarette butts in ceramic tiles Tobacco; Smoking; Leachates Cigarettes are one of the favoured commodities on our planet. However, the annual consumption of 5.7 trillion cigarettes and 75% littering rate results in cigarette butts (CBs) being one of the most critical environmental issues. The leachate of heavy metals and toxic chemicals is polluting our ecosystem and threatening the wildlife species. Therefore, it is crucial to find effective and efficient recycling methods to solve the growing CB waste issue. In this study, unglazed fired ceramic tiles were manufactured with 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% shredded CBs by dry mass to investigate the feasibility of the proposed sustainable recycling method. The chemical and mineralogical characterisation, density, shrinkage, bulk density, breaking strength, water absorption, and modulus of rupture were investigated and compared with the Australian Standards for ceramic tiles (AS 4459). The results revealed that tiles incorporating 0.5% CBs by mass demonstrated the greatest performance compared to the other mixtures. The water absorption for all tileâ€“CB mixtures was found to be greater than 10%, with a positive growth tendency. The addition of 0.5% CBs by mass slightly improved flexural strength from 15.56 MPa for control samples to 16.63 MPa. Tiles containing 0.5% CBs by mass satisfied the modulus of rupture and water absorption limits for group III class according to the Australian Standards (AS 13006), and they may be suitable to be used as wall tiles. The result of a simulation equation predicts that an energy savings of up to 7.79% is achievable during the firing process for ceramic tiles incorporating 1% CBs by mass."

"Increasing Use of Human-Dominated Habitats as CO2 Emissions Warm and Acidify Oceans Biodiversity; Patellogastropoda; Intertidal Community Urban and artificial structures are increasingly added to the worldâ€™s coasts during a time in which changing climate is forecast to drive shifts in naturally occurring habitats. We ask whether the role of artificial structures as marine habitats will increase in importance relative to their natural counterparts, particularly as natural habitats are negatively affected by ocean warming and acidification. To evaluate this model, we contrasted use of natural (kelp forest and turfing algae) and artificial habitat (plastic pier-piling) by a nest-building amphipod (Cymadusa pemptos) under current and future climate conditions of CO2 and temperature. Under future conditions, amphipod populations in mesocosms increased, but this did not lead to greater proportional colonization of kelp and turf. Instead, colonization doubled in artificial habitats, and there was increasing production and occupation of nests on artificial habitats relative to natural habitats. In an age when human modification of natural substrata is increasingly cited as an agent of wildlife decline, understanding the future role of artificial habitats as replacement dwellings for natural habitats is critical. We pioneer an understanding of the future role of natural and artificial habitats, identifying the possibility that the role of urban structures as marine habitats may only increase."

"The knock-on effects of green buildings: high-rise construction design implications Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Purpose: The aims and objectives of this research are to establish whether or not the transition into green building in high-rise construction is practical. This is after considering several perspectives including financial, economic, environmental, and social. This subsequently leads to an evaluation on whether or not the continuation with a standard conventional build of high-rise buildings remains to be the most feasible option. Such objectives, therefore, aim to allow for validation of how and why high-rise construction designs are impacted through green buildings effects. Design/methodology/approach: Through six defined steps, the methodology commences with an introductory section of what it means to build green. This section is further broken down to evaluate what factors are involved in constructing a green building. Furthermore, the life cycle energy (LCE) is used as a framework to evaluate the knock-on effects of green buildings and subsequent high-rise construction design implications. Findings: Through defining the ongoing relationship of green materials and sustainable design, various implications for high-rise constructions were discovered. First and foremost, it was determined that the LCE is the central consideration for any high-rise building design. In evaluating the LCE, and overall operating energy of the 50-year cycle of a building was carried out. As the results showed, the operating energy represents around 85% of the total energy that is consumed at the end of the 50 years cycle of the building. Precise LCE calculation can lead to a more efficient design for high-rise buildings. As a result, an increased understanding of the current status of green buildings within the construction industry is paramount. This understanding leads to a better insight into the contributing factors to green building in high-rise construction and the construction industry in general. Originality/value: The potential contribution that can be gained from this research is the awareness that is raised in the research and development of green buildings in high-rise construction. This can be achieved by using certain materials such as new energy-efficient building materials, recycled materials and so on. This research will contribute to defining a new way of sustainable buildings, particularly for high-rise construction. The outcome of the research will be beneficial for practitioners such as design engineers and other related professions."

"Leveraging endogenous climate resilience: urban adaptation in Pacific Small Island Developing States Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Pacific Small Island Developing States are often referred to as the â€œfrontlineâ€ of climate change, facing an array of worsening climate-related shocks and stressors. However, despite their underlying exposure to climate change impacts, the role of Pacific Island cities as both an avenue for adaptation and sites of climate vulnerability is often overlooked. This paper reflects on two ongoing participatory action research projects conducted by UN-Habitat and research partners from Australian universities in Honiara, Solomon Islands, and Port Vila, Vanuatu. Findings from community consultations across 16 communities in these settings demonstrate the critical role of endogenous modes of resilience, as well as the strong correlation between these spaces and sub-city climate vulnerability. Cross-scale integration with climate resilience planning processes is then used to examine points of conflict between stakeholder interpretations of core functions within socioecological systems, demonstrating the importance of considering values and conflict within urban climate adaptation."
"Envelope glycoprotein determinants of HIV-1 subtype C tropism and pathogenicity Nearly all HIV studies have been conducted on subtype B HIV. However, the overwhelming majority of individuals with HIV are infected with subtype C virus (C-HIV), and reside in Southern Africa and Central Asia. Despite this we know very little about C-HIV, although we do know that its pathogenesis is distinct from other HIV subtypes and likely involves unique genetic, structural and functional alterations in the viral envelope glycoproteins (Env). Our study will elucidate the Env-receptor interactions that evolve over time in subjects infected with C-HIV that dictate tropism alterations for macrophages and CD4+ T-cell subsets. We will show that these interactions are unique to C-HIV and important for C-HIV disease progression."

Tensile properties of multifunctional composites embedded with lithium-ion polymer batteries Carbon Fibers; Electrochemical Capacitors; Battery Multifunctional composites that combine high mechanical properties with electrical energy storage capacity are being explored for use in hybrid and electric powered vehicles. This paper evaluates the effect of embedding lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) batteries on the tensile properties and energy storage density of carbon fibre laminate and sandwich composite. The tensile modulus and failure stress of the laminate is reduced significantly by the batteries. The reduction in tensile strength is similar for one or multiple embedded batteries whereas the reduction in tensile modulus increases with the number of batteries. LiPo batteries embedded in the foam core to sandwich composite do not adversely affect the tensile properties. These findings are validated numerically with finite element (FE) modelling of the laminate and sandwich composite. The energy storage capacity and electrical properties of the LiPo battery was not changed when the composites were subjected to increasing tensile loads up to final failure.

Even though scholars have acknowledged the possibility that both competitive and non-competitive partners participate in such projects, we still lack a holistic perspective on their complex interactions. This paper builds on open innovation and coopetition literature to explore the influence of research partners and clusters on the relationships between competing companies in different project phases of RandD projects. The study is based on insights from five coopetitive RandD projects in mature industries. Findings revealed the need for simultaneous involvement of research partners and clusters when establishing the collaboration in the pre-project phase, while research partners have dominant roles in balancing coopetition in both the pre-project and project implementation phases. Propositions are offered to inform future studies and managerial implications are discussed."

"Tropical cyclone early warnings for the regions of the Southern Hemisphere: strengthening resilience to tropical cyclones in small island developing states and least developed countries El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Wind Shear; Cyclogenesis Tropical cyclones (TCs) affect countries in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) tropics every year causing significant humanitarian impacts and much damage to the natural environment. To reduce TC impacts on societies, early warning systems (EWS) are used to communicate the risk to the public. In 1999, the Climate Change and Southern Hemisphere Tropical Cyclones International Initiative (CCSHTCII) was established to enhance EWS for TCs in SH countries, with particular focus on support for small island developing states and least developed countries to provide effective public early warnings of TC risk. In this paper, recent activities of the CCSHTCII to strengthen TC EWS are presented. Using TC best track data from the SH TC historical data archive, the impact of the El NiÃ±oâ€“Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on inter-annual and spatial variability of TC activity is examined. TC-ENSO relationships in the SH are analysed and used as a scientific basis for the production of TC season outlooks. Communication of TC early warnings through TC season outlooks is described, and recommendations for improving outlooks are provided."

Kumar has developed a non-invasive imaging technology which is based on hyperspectral imaging and this can identify regions of poor blood supply. Indus Instruments Inc is a research oriented company that focuses on technology to monitor blood-flow and manufacture Doppler devices. This project will validate the use of hyperspectral imaging (HySI) technology developed by Kumar for identifying ischemic regions and regions with poor perfusion by laboratory based comparison of HySI and Doppler measurements. This will lead to a non-intrusive, easy to use, point-of-care device for detecting regions of poor perfusion in conditions such as diabetic foot ulcers, which if not diagnosed in time can lead to amputation. It will identify low perfusion areas in at risk of ulceration which can be addressed by offloading, revascularisation or other wound management strategies. Another potential application of this device would be to detect ischemic conditions due to pressure which is a major cause of chronic wounds among the elderly or people in long-term bed-rest.

"Case-based reasoning approach for supporting building green retrofit decisions Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation Building green retrofit is considered as an effective means of energy saving and achieving sustainable development goals. The success of a building retrofit is highly dependent on the retrofit strategies used. However, it remains challenging to select appropriate retrofit strategies for a specific retrofit building. There are numerous cases of building retrofit around the world, which can be collected, stored, and analysed. The knowledge gained from these cases could provide a useful reference for making decisions on new retrofitting projects. This study presents a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach to support building green retrofit decisions. A total of 71 retrofit cases in China were collected. The attributes of the retrofitting buildings were identified, including the general building information, component information, and energy and cost information. A synthetic optimisation weighting method was adopted based on both expert opinion and the attribute characteristics. A real retrofit case located in Shanghai was used as a case study to demonstrate the application of the CBR approach. The results indicate that the CBR approach can aid in identifying similar cases from the case database, and extracting valuable information from these. The experience and lessons learned from past cases can guide decision makers in making improved decisions on new green retrofit projects."

"Conventional Treatment for Multiple Myeloma Drives Premature Aging Phenotypes and Metabolic Dysfunction in T Cells Daratumumab; Elotuzumab; Monoclonal Antibodies New diagnoses of multiple myeloma (MM) tend to occur after the age of 60, by which time thymic output is severely reduced. As a consequence, lymphocyte recovery after lymphopenia-inducing anti-MM therapies relies on homeostatic proliferation of peripheral T cells rather than replenishment by new thymic emigrants. To assess lymphocyte recovery and phenotype in patients with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) and relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM), we tracked CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations at serial time points throughout treatment and compared them to age-matched healthy donors (HD). Anti-MM therapies and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) caused a permanent reduction in the CD4:8 ratio, a decrease in naÃ¯ve CD4+ T cells, and an increase in effector memory T cells and PD1-expressing CD4+ T cells. Transcriptional profiling highlighted that genes associated with fatty acid Î²-oxidation were upregulated in T cells in RRMM, suggesting increased reliance on mitochondrial respiration. High mitochondrial mass was seen in all T cell subsets in RRMM but with relatively suppressed reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings highlight that anti-MM and ASCT therapies perturb the composition of the T cell compartment and drive substantial metabolic remodeling, which may affect the fitness of T cells for immunotherapies. This is particularly pertinent to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy, which might be more efficacious if T cells were stored prior to ASCT rather than at relapse."

"The Acute Toxicity of Salinity in Onshore Unconventional Gas Waters to Freshwater Invertebrates in Receiving Environments: A Systematic Review Hydraulic Fracturing; Natural Gas; Produced Water Industries such as unconventional natural gas have seen increased global expansion to meet the increasing energy needs of our increasing global population. Unconventional gas uses hydraulic fracturing that produces significant volumes of produced waters, which can be highly saline and pose a toxic threat to freshwater invertebrates if exposure via discharges, spills, leaks, or runoff were to occur. The primary aim of the present review was to determine the sodium (Na+) and chloride (Clâˆ’) content of these waters as an approximate measure of salinity and how these values compare to the NaCl or synthetic marine salt acute toxicity values of freshwater invertebrate taxa. Shale gas produced waters are much more saline with 78 900 Â± 10 200 NaCl mg/L and total dissolved solids (TDS) of 83 200 Â± 12 200 mg/L compared to coal bed methane (CBM) produced waters with 4300 Â± 1100 NaCl mg/L and TDS of 5900 Â± 1300 mg/L and pose a far greater toxicity risk from NaCl to freshwater invertebrates. In addition, the toxicity of other major ions (Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, (Formula presented.), HCO3âˆ’, and (Formula presented.)) and their influence on the toxicity of Na+ and Clâˆ’ were evaluated. Exposure of untreated and undiluted shale gas produced waters to freshwater invertebrates is likely to result in significant or complete mortality.

"When institutional logics meet information and communication technologies: Examining hybrid information practices in Ghana’s agriculture Institutional Work; Illegitimacy; Microfoundations In this paper, we describe how changes in the availability of information artifactsâ€” in particular, information and communication technologies (ICTs)â€”among smallholder farmers in Ghana, led to a process of hybridization of information practices, and how this process could be linked to underlying institutional change. We use the notions of institutional carriers and activity systems to study the evolution of the prevailing â€œsmallholderâ€ institutional logic of Ghanaian agriculture toward an incoming â€œvalue-chainâ€ institutional logic concerned with linking farmers to output markets, improving the knowledge base in agriculture, and increasing its information intensity. We draw on a mixed-methods approach, including in-depth qualitative interviews, focus groups, observations, and detailed secondary quantitative data. We cultivate activity theory as a practice-based lens for structuring inquiry into institutional change. We find that information artifacts served to link the activities of farmers that were embedded in the smallholder logic with those of agricultural-development actors that promoted the value-chain logic. Hybridization occurred through the use of artifacts with different interaction modalities. In terms of conceptualizing change, our findings suggest that hybridization of the two logics may be an intermediary point in the long transition from the smallholder toward the value-chain logic."
"Tropical forest canopies and their relationships with climate and disturbance: results from a global dataset of consistent field-based measurements Leaf Area Index; Canopies; Canopy Reflectance Background: Canopy structure, defined by leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FCover) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), regulates a wide range of forest functions and ecosystem services. Spatially consistent field-measurements of canopy structure are however lacking, particularly for the tropics. Methods: Here, we introduce the Global LAI database: a global dataset of field-based canopy structure measurements spanning tropical forests in four continents (Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas). We use these measurements to test for climate dependencies within and across continents, and to test for the potential of anthropogenic disturbance and forest protection to modulate those dependences. Results: Using data collected from 887 tropical forest plots, we show that maximum water deficit, defined across the most arid months of the year, is an important predictor of canopy structure, with all three canopy attributes declining significantly with increasing water deficit. Canopy attributes also increase with minimum temperature, and with the protection of forests according to both active (within protected areas) and passive measures (through topography). Once protection and continent effects are accounted for, other anthropogenic measures (e.g. human population) do not improve the model. Conclusions: We conclude that canopy structure in the tropics is primarily a consequence of forest adaptation to the maximum water deficits historically experienced within a given region. Climate change, and in particular changes in drought regimes may thus affect forest structure and function, but forest protection may offer some resilience against this effect."
"An Investigation into the Relationship between Logistics Managers’ Competencies and Performance in the Nexus of Training and Industry Requirements: The Case of Vietnam (Administered by University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City) The skilled and competent workforce in logistics and supply chain management contributes greatly to the success of the sector and subsequently the national economy especially in developing countries like Vietnam. As business environments continue to change, the sector faces many challenges, of which the need for well trained and skilled logistics professionals is unquestionably essential. This research project aims to investigate how the level of competencies would affect the extent of individual performance of logistics managers in Vietnam. It will also examine whether these competencies are in line with the current industry requirements and need for the future, especially in the context of Industrial Revolution 4.0, and whether they are addressed by existing education and training programs in the country. The multi-phased approach is employed as follows. "
"Reciprocal relationships between daily sleep and mood: A systematic review of naturalistic prospective studies Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Insomnia; Sleep Hygiene An intimate relationship exists between sleep and affective states. Disturbances in sleep are common across a spectrum of psychopathologies, and are recognised as precipitating or prodromal factors for mood disorders. Conversely, affective states can impact sleep quality and ability to fall asleep. However, one of the main limitations of this literature is that studies have typically assessed sleep and mood at one time point and studies are often laboratory-based, where measurement of both sleep and mood has dubious ecological validity. The aim of the current review was to systematically examine the evidence for associations between day-to-day fluctuations in sleep and mood in naturalistic studies using ambulatory diary techniques. Electronic databases (EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SCOPUS) were searched for studies using experience sampling methodology to investigate daily associations between sleep and mood in naturalistic environments in healthy and clinical samples. Findings of the included studies supported the notion of a reciprocal relationship between subjective sleep variables (sleep quality, sleep duration and sleep latency) and daytime affective states over the short term, and highlight the potential clinical importance of daily sleep disturbance in the prediction and prevention of the development of psychopathology in the future."
"Foreign aid and development goals: Revisiting the evidence Aid; Official Development Assistance; International Cooperation In this chapter, the authors examine the impact of foreign aid on eight development targets capturing poverty, education, extreme hunger, gender equality, child mortality, maternal mortality, prevalence of HIV and access to portable water. Findings show that an increase in net Official Development Assistance (ODA) is associated with a decline in the prevalence of HIV and child mortality. The authors further examine the role of sectoral aid in the development process and show that targeted aid is likely to be more beneficial for development."
"Recent advances in novel graphene: new horizons in renewable energy storage technologies Sodium-ion Batteries; Electrode; Ion Storage With the rising need for energy resources, considerable work has done for building novel energy storage technologies. Supercapacitors (SCs) and batteries are a highly competitive choice for electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs) due to their ultrahigh power density, improved rate capability, long-term cyclability, and remarkable safety. Because of their novel properties such as high mechanical flexibility, large specific surface area (SSA), chemical stability, and superior electric and thermal conductivities, graphene-based nanomaterials (NMs) have attracted considerable attention as alternative electrode materials for EESDs. Graphene is gaining a lot of interest since it has amazing qualities including 230 000 cm2 V-1 s-1 charge mobility, 3000 W m-1 K-1 thermal conductivity, 2.3% visible light absorption, 130 GPa mechanical strength, and 2600 m2 g-1 specific surface area (SSA). Mechanical exfoliation, reduction of graphene-oxide, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and epitaxial growth of graphene-NMs are some of the synthetic procedures that can change these characteristics. Despite much effort, the detailed screening of high-performance electrode materials, such as graphene-based NMs, is still necessary. We covered the recent advancements in graphene-based NM research and development for high-performance batteries and SCs for specific applications in the next generation and smart electronics in this study. First, we discuss rechargeable batteries, a new-concept based on graphene with high energy density, longer life, improved safety, and shape-diversity capabilities in order to meet the needs of future electronics. Second, we discuss SCs for the present advanced nanotechnologies that outperform batteries with respect to power density, cyclability, quick charging/discharging rates capability, straightforward principles, high activity of the charge circulation, and low maintenance expenditure, including electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors (PCs). Finally, graphene-based electrodes used in ESDs with their prospects and problems are briefly reviewed."

"Systematic review on sono-assisted CO2 stripping, solvent recovery and energy demand aspects in solvent-based post-combustion carbon dioxide capture process Amine; 2-Amino-2-Methyl-1-Propanol; Reboilers Post-combustion carbon dioxide capture (PCCC) based on chemical absorption is a mature technology, commercially feasible, easily installed and retrofitted to existing industrial plants. The limitations at stripper conditions are solvent regeneration energy, solvent loss, degradation, and solvent make-up cost. Research efforts have been conducted to improve solvent's absorption capacity, reduce pressure, reduce undesired product/contaminants formation with an optimal design process to operate at maximum efficiency. Nevertheless, energy loss during solvent regeneration remains a persistent problem. This systematic review focuses on the application of low and high-frequency ultrasonics for carbon-rich solvent regeneration in PCCC to address the issues associated with energy demand, CO2 stripping, solvent recovery. The study shows the potential for reducing carbon capture energy demand and improved operating conditions. In terms of mass transfer enhancement, size, cost, compact design, solvent degradation, low/high viscosity operation which has an advantage over conventional solvent regeneration techniques and is a potential alternative. Bath-type sonication provides uniform distribution of sonication effect over large volume has the scaling-up potential to bench, pilot and industrial-scale. Furthermore, a process flow diagram of CCS with integration of sono-assisted carbon-rich solvent regeneration in place of conventional solvent regeneration is discussed."

"The role of strategic interactions in risk-taking behavior: A study from asset growth perspective Bank Efficiency; Banking Industry; Banking This study uses panel data on Vietnamese commercial banks from 2008 to 2018 in order to investigate the role of strategic interactions in determining bank risk-taking behavior by considering bank asset growth. The results suggest that aggressive competition is less favorable for banks striving for stability and that a high value of competitive strategy measure (as a proxy for strategic interactions) encourages risk-taking incentives. We also find that the distributional effects of strategic interaction on bank risk-taking because of asset growth reveal that the uncertainty in strategic-interaction-driven profits diminishes in banks with higher growth. This finding is consistent with the idea that when competition becomes more aggressive, bank restructuring should focus on increasing total assets by merging and acquiring small- and medium-sized banks to stabilize the banking sector. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that banks with low leverage or under regulatory pressure engage in more risk-taking. Therefore, policymakers may not implement a tighter capital requirement that contributes to a heightened level of risk. The results are robust to alternative measures of risk-taking and monetary policy stance as well as different econometric specifications."

"A comparative modeling study on nonclimatic and climatic risk assessment on Asian Tiger Mosquito (Aedes albopictus) Aedes Albopictus; Culicidae; Aedes Aedes albopictus, the Asian Tiger Mosquito, vector of Chikungunya, Dengue Fever and Zika viruses, has proven its hardy adaptability in expansion from its natural Asian, forest edge, tree hole habitat on the back of international trade transportation, re-establishing in temperate urban surrounds, in a range of water receptacles and semi-enclosures of organic matter. Conventional aerial spray mosquito vector controls focus on wetland and stagnant water expanses, proven to miss the protected hollows and crevices favoured by Ae. albopictus. New control or eradication strategies are thus essential, particular in light of potential expansions in the southeastern and eastern USA. Successful regional vector control strategies require risk level analysis. Should strategies prioritize regions with non-climatic or climatic suitability parameters for Ae. albopictus? Our study used current Ae. albopictus distribution data to develop two independent models: (i) regions with suitable non-climatic factors, and (ii) regions with suitable climate for Ae. albopictus in southeastern USA. Non-climatic model processing used Evidential Belief Function (EBF), together with six geographical conditioning factors (raster data layers), to establish the probability index. Validation of the analysis results was estimated with area under the curve (AUC) using Ae. albopictus presence data. Climatic modeling was based on two General Circulation Models (GCMs), Miroc3.2 and CSIRO-MK30 running the RCP 8.5 scenario in MaxEnt software. EBF non- climatic model results achieved a 0.70 prediction rate and 0.73 success rate, confirming suitability of the study site regions for Ae. albopictus establishment. The climatic model results showed the best-fit model comprised Coldest Quarter Mean Temp, Precipitation of Wettest Quarter and Driest Quarter Precipitation factors with mean AUC value of 0.86. Both GCMs showed that the whole study site is highly suitable and will remain suitable climatically, according to the prediction for 2055, for Ae. albopictus expansion."
"Development of on-site poster to influence pedestrian jaywalking behavior Crash Injuries; Crash; Random Parameters Jaywalking and distracted walking behaviors are traffic violations that contribute significantly to road traffic crashes, including crashes at intersections. Jaywalking blitzes by police after pedestrian crashes may not address many of the issues that cause the vast majority of these crashes. One common approach adopted to strengthen enforcement methods is a publicity and awareness campaign. Despite the prevalence of communication campaigns and road safety signage, relatively few studies have been conducted to examine their efficacies, with few messages having been designed using behavioral change theories, especially for pedestrian safety. This study aims to design an intersection safety poster to influence jay walking behavior. The design applied several theoretical constructs from well-established behavioral change models. A questionnaire survey of the perceived efficacy of the poster was administered to a sample of 754 respondents in Melbourne. Preliminary results show that the poster had a positive effect on respondentsâ€™ adaptive intentions. The results demonstrate the importance of using a well-established conceptual framework in the development and testing of road safety messages. In future, an evaluation study will be conducted to test effectiveness of the poster."

"Adherence to CONSORT items in randomized controlled trials of integrative medicine for colorectal cancer published in Chinese journals Consort; Meta-Analysis; Reporting Background: The majority of studies of integrative treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) have been published in Chinese journals. These studies indicate potential benefits, but concerns have been raised over the quality of trials published in Chinese journals. The CONSORT statement provides a guide for study reporting that has been endorsed by more than 400 international journals. Previous studies have used the CONSORT checklist to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Objectives: This study focused on RCTs of integrative and traditional medicine for CRC published in Chinese journals and assessed: (1) the overall quality of reporting with a focus on methodological aspects; (2) change over time; and (3) the influence of study funding, level of institution conducting the trial, rank of the journal, and the length of the article. Design: Searches of seven databases identified RCTs. Quality was assessed using CONSORT 2010 with adaptations to facilitate scoring. Additional codes were added for publication year, hospital rank, report length, and status of the journal. Scores of each checklist item, total scores, and scores for eight items associated with RCT methodology were calculated. Results: Eighty-one studies were included in the main analyses. The RCT methodology subgroup scores were significantly higher in studies: with public funding, conducted by authors from university hospitals, published in higher ranked journals, and in longer articles. Conclusions: Few Chinese journals mention CONSORT in their author guidelines. In these RCTs on CRC better reporting of RCT methodology was associated with ranking of the journal as ""core,"" public funding of the RCT, and first or correspondent author from a university hospital but the quality of reporting had not significantly improved in 15 years. As the volume of scientific information produced in China grows, it is imperative that there is growth in the quality of this information."
"A Dual Protection System for Heterostructured 3D CNT/CoSe2/C as High Areal Capacity Anode for Sodium Storage Sodium-ion Batteries; Electrode; Ion Storage 3D electrode design is normally opted for multiple advantages, however, instability/detachment of active material causes the pulverization and degradation of the structure, and ultimately poor cyclic stability. Here, a dually protected, highly compressible, and freestanding anode is presented for sodium-ion batteries, where 3D carbon nanotube (CNT) sponge is decorated with homogeneously dispersed CoSe2 nanoparticles (NPs) which are protected under carbon overcoat (CNT/CoSe2/C). The 3D CNT sponge delivers enough space for high mass loading while providing high mechanical strength and faster conduction pathway among the NPs. The outer amorphous carbon overcoat controls the formation of solid electrolyte interphase film by avoiding direct contact of CoSe2 with electrolyte, accommodates large volume changes, and ultimately enhances the overall conductivity of cell and assists in transmitting electron to an external circuit. Moreover, the hybrid can be densified up to 11-fold without affecting its microstructure that results in ultrahigh areal mass loading of 17.4 mg cmâˆ’2 and an areal capacity of 7.03 mAh cmâˆ’2 along with a high gravimetric capacity of 531 mAh gâˆ’1 at 100 mA gâˆ’1. Thus, compact and smart devices can be realized by this new electrode design for heavy-duty commercial applications."
"Comprehensive Structural and Molecular Comparison of Spike Proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and Their Interactions with ACE2 Nasopharyngeal Swabs; Serologic Tests; COVID-19 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged in China and caused a disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus quickly spread around the world, causing a sustained global outbreak. Although SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) are highly similar genetically and at the protein production level, there are significant differences between them. Research has shown that the structural spike (S) protein plays an important role in the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. So far, studies have shown that various genes encoding primarily for elements of S protein undergo frequent mutation. We have performed an in-depth review of the literature covering the structural and mutational aspects of S protein in the context of SARS-CoV-2, and compared them with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Our analytical approach consisted in an initial genome and transcriptome analysis, followed by primary, secondary and tertiary protein structure analysis. Additionally, we investigated the potential effects of these differences on the S protein binding and interactions to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and we established, after extensive analysis of previous research articles, that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use different ends/regions in S protein receptor-binding motif (RBM) and different types of interactions for their chief binding with ACE2. These differences may have significant implications on pathogenesis, entry and ability to infect intermediate hosts for these coronaviruses. This review comprehensively addresses in detail the variations in S protein, its receptor-binding characteristics and detailed structural interactions, the process of cleavage involved in priming, as well as other differences between coronaviruses."
"The Balance Between Safety and Productivity and its Relationship with Human Factors and Safety Awareness and Communication in Aircraft Manufacturing Safety Climate; Accident; Health Management Background: This paper presents the findings of a pilot research survey which assessed the degree of balance between safety and productivity, and its relationship with awareness and communication of human factors and safety rules in the aircraft manufacturing environment. Methods: The study was carried out at two Australian aircraft manufacturing facilities where a Likert-scale questionnaire was administered to a representative sample. The research instrument included topics relevant to the safety and human factors training provided to the target workforce. The answers were processed in overall, and against demographic characteristics of the sample population. Results: The workers were sufficiently aware of how human factors and safety rules influence their performance and acknowledged that supervisors had adequately communicated such topics. Safety and productivity seemed equally balanced across the sample. A preference for the former over the latter was associated with a higher awareness about human factors and safety rules, but not linked with safety communication. The size of the facility and the length and type of employment were occasionally correlated with responses to some communication and human factors topics and the equilibrium between productivity and safety. Conclusion: Although human factors training had been provided and sufficient bidirectional communication was present across the sample, it seems that quality and complexity factors might have influenced the effects of those safety related practices on the safetyâ€“productivity balance for specific parts of the population studied. Customization of safety training and communication to specific characteristics of employees may be necessary to achieve the desired outcomes."

"Improving equity of Hepatitis B treatment access and outcomes by informing spatial targeting of resources (Project 4.410) The burden of chronic hepatitis B infection in Australia is disproportionately borne by migrants and Indigenous peoples, groups with distinctive spatial settlement and migration characteristics. Along with high infection risk, these populations experience well-documented challenges in accessing health services. Currently funded projects are focussed on (i) mapping hepatitis burden, interventions and outcomes (http://www.ashm.org.au/HBVmapping/) and (ii) using models to predict future disease and treatment requirements at national level. The present proposal depends critically on these projects, and will extend them by developing
innovative integrated spatial statistical and mechanistic models of hepatitis B in Australia. We will use demographic modelling approaches to augment existing data enabling more
accurate spatial assessment of disease burden and differential case detection. Models of the clinical disease pathway, including treatment, will be used to integrate spatially referenced
data sources on interventions and outcomes, including the influence of mobility and treatment access on effective care delivery. This process will identify barriers to case detection and service provision that limit current application of the National Hepatitis B Strategy, and inform prediction of future disease burden and treatment needs. Lessons learned will improve ongoing strategic rollout of effective therapies through this program to reduce health inequalities experienced by priority populations."

"Biological Control of the Noxious Weed Angled Onion (Allium triquetrum) Thwarted by Endophytic Bacteria in Victoria, Australia Quorum Sensing; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa; N-Octanoylhomoserine Lactone The noxious weed Allium triquetrum (Alliaceae) has invaded widespread areas in southern Australia, forming dense monocultures that threaten indigenous ground flora. Two soilborne biocontrol agents, the fungus Stromatinia cepivora and the bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Pcc) have previously been reported as killing A. triquetrum in gnotobiotic controlled conditions. This study aimed to find why glasshouse pot trials in complex potting media and field trials showed no effect of inoculation with either agent. Bacteria were consistently isolated from inside surface-sterilised bases and bulbs of A. triquetrum. Most bacteria from actively growing plants were closely related to Bacillus but one from dormant bulbs (RPTAtOch1) belonged to Ochrobactrum. Most bacteria reduced soft rot caused by Pcc in vitro by up to 100% when inoculated the day before Pcc. Co-cultivation with Pcc reduced its extracellular pectin lyase and polygalacturonase, which target plant cell walls. RPTAtOch1 was identified as O. quorumnocens by traditional physiological, biochemical and molecular tests, whole genome sequencing and Average Nucleotide Identity comparisons. Its draft genome consisted of 76 contigs, 70% of which were closest to isolate A44 of O. quorumnocens, which antagonises soft rotting of potato by Pcc by destroying its quorum-sensing lactones but, like RPTAtOch1, does not inhibit growth of Pcc. Also, endophytic bacteria inhibited germination of S. cepivora sclerotia and so prevented white rot. Thus, the failure in biocontrol of A. triquetrum by both S. cepivora and Pcc may be due, ironically, to biocontrol of the intended pathogens by endophytic bacteria inside the target weed."

"The New Century for Nickel Resources, Reserves, and Mining: Reassessing the Sustainability of the Devil’s Metal Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals Nickel (Ni) is fundamentally important to the modern world for stainless steel, specialty alloys, electroplating, batteries, and other uses. Global Ni demand is expected to soar as the world transitions to a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions economy based on electric vehicles and energy storage batteries linked to renewable energy systems. This means that understanding the current Ni sector, especially known Ni resources, reserves, and mining (i.e., current and likely future sources of this metal), is crucial to enabling this energy transition, including the likely environmental, social, and governmental challenges that may prevent the development or may hinder the continuation of future and current Ni mining operations. This paper achieves this by presenting a comprehensive global assessment of reported Ni deposits and projects for the year 2018. All of these are classified by mineral deposit type to understand the relative importance of the different mineral systems that are mined for Ni and allocate each site a primary and secondary mineral deposit type. We also compare our results for 2018 with the results of a previous study focused on 2011 data to understand how deposits and projects have evolved over time and coincident with production. The majority of Ni has been and will continue to be sourced from laterites and magmatic sulfide systems; other deposits have produced only minor amounts of Ni. Our database indicates that globally some 627 Ni deposits remain with in-ground resources and/or reserves, including 148 and 86 laterite, 248 and 93 magmatic sulfide, 33 and 14 hydrothermal, and three and two tailings Ni-containing code- and noncode-compliant resources, respectively. Projects with reserve estimates include 38 laterite reserves, 70 magmatic sulfide, and three hydrothermal Ni-containing reserves. These data yield 350.2 million metric tonnes (Mt) of contained Ni in resources distributed as 190.2, 124.1, and 35.4 Mt Ni in laterite, magmatic sulfide, and hydrothermal resources, respectively. Reserves contain 47.12 Mt of Ni split into 25.97, 20.14, and 1.01 Mt Ni in laterite, magmatic sulfide, and hydrothermal reserves, respectively. Comparison of these data to 2011 data indicates that sulfide deposits are effectively keeping pace with depletion by mining, whereas laterite resources are lower than in 2011, perhaps reflecting the fact that the latter can be more comprehensively assessed during the early stage of laterite resource and reserve estimation. This suggests that although current resources are sufficient to enable current production to be sustained, the expected increase in demand for Ni may act to constrain supply. This may also be exacerbated by the increasing environmental, social, and governmental challenges facing the minerals industry globally, with a number of projects that have faced delays or problems associated with these challenges also outlined in this study. Our study also highlights the variable level of sustainability reporting undertaken by different companies involved in Ni mining and exploration. One potential approach to more effective environmental and social engagement would be improvements in this area, allowing more transparent engagement with social and environmental stakeholders. Overall, known Ni resources and reserves are sufficient to continue current levels of production for several decades to come (assuming all of this material can be mined); however, the Ni mining sector faces a number of challenges that may change this, including increased demand from electric vehicles and batteries and potential supply restrictions relating to increased environmental, social, and governmental challenges to the mining industry globally."

"Beyond the tools: supporting adaptation when organisational resources and capacities are in short supply Decision Making; Foresight; Alternative Futures Climate change adaptation is increasingly concerned with how organisations develop capacity to adapt to uncertain futures. A participatory action research project conducted in Victoria, Australia, examined how health and social service organisations developed their organisational adaptive capacity through the use of adaptation decision-support tools. It can be challenging for any organisation to select and apply a decision-support tool, but this is particularly the case where resources and capacities are limited. For most organisations, climate change is only one of a complex set of dynamic stressors they must consider in meeting organisational goals. This paper shows that while decision-support tools can help co-generate knowledge and facilitate customised organisational adaptation processes, for them to be practically helpful for organisations with limited resources and capacities, intensive collaborative and discursive processes are needed to adjust such tools to fit specific organisational contexts and needs. Facilitators and participatory approaches that enable co-inquiry can play a critical role in supplementing scarce resources and initiating adaptation processes that go well beyond the scope and purpose of the decision-support tool used. Organisations working effectively with decision-support tools to adapt to climate change will need to feel ownership of them and have confidence in modifying them to suit their particular adaptation needs and organisational goals."

"Individual tree canopy parameters estimation using uav-based photogrammetric and lidar point clouds in an urban park Lidar; Tree Crown; Canopy Height Estimation of urban tree canopy parameters plays a crucial role in urban forest management. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely used for many applications particularly forestry mapping. UAV-derived images, captured by an onboard camera, provide a means to produce 3D point clouds using photogrammetric mapping. Similarly, small UAV mounted light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can also provide very dense 3D point clouds. While point clouds derived from both photogrammetric and LiDAR sensors can allow the accurate estimation of critical tree canopy parameters, so far a comparison of both techniques is missing. Point clouds derived from these sources vary according to differences in data collection and processing, a detailed comparison of point clouds in terms of accuracy and completeness, in relation to tree canopy parameters using point clouds is necessary. In this research, point clouds produced by UAV-photogrammetry and-LiDAR over an urban park along with the estimated tree canopy parameters are compared, and results are presented. The results show that UAV-photogrammetry and-LiDAR point clouds are highly correlated with R2 of 99.54% and the estimated tree canopy parameters are correlated with R2 of higher than 95%."
"Site mapping and small molecule blind docking reveal a possible target site on the SARS-CoV-2 main protease dimer interface Pharmacotherapy; Prolongation; COVID-19 The SARS-CoV-2 virus is causing COVID-19 resulting in an ongoing pandemic with serious health, social, and economic implications. Much research is focused in repurposing or identifying new small molecules which may interact with viral or host-cell molecular targets. An important SARS-CoV-2 target is the main protease (Mpro), and the peptidomimetic Î±-ketoamides represent prototypical experimental inhibitors. The protease is characterised by the dimerization of two monomers each which contains the catalytic dyad defined by Cys145 and His41 residues (active site). Dimerization yields the functional homodimer. Here, our aim was to investigate small molecules, including lopinavir and ritonavir, Î±-ketoamide 13b, and ebselen, for their ability to interact with the Mpro. The sirtuin 1 agonist SRT1720 was also used in our analyses. Blind docking to each monomer individually indicated preferential binding of the ligands in the active site. Site-mapping of the dimeric protease indicated a highly reactive pocket in the dimerization region at the domain III apex. Blind docking consistently indicated a strong preference of ligand binding in domain III, away from the active site. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that ligands docked both to the active site and in the dimerization region at the apex, formed relatively stable interactions. Overall, our findings do not obviate the superior potency with respect to inhibition of protease activity of covalently-linked inhibitors such as Î±-ketoamide 13b in the Mpro active site. Nevertheless, along with those from others, our findings highlight the importance of further characterisation of the Mpro active site and any potential allosteric sites."

"Unlocking the potential of magnetic 2D materials with quantum microscopy This project aims to create a universal, high-throughput platform to characterise magnetic 2D materials, by
exploiting recently developed quantum diamond microscopy. It will enable the measurement of hitherto
inaccessible magnetic properties of individual 2D microsheets, the imaging of device-relevant phenomena such as
domain wall dynamics and skyrmionics, and the systematic screening of newly synthesised materials. Anticipated
outcomes include crucial new insights into 2D magnetism and the discovery of magnetic 2D materials compatible
with real-world conditions. This should accelerate the development of future energy-efficient and flexible
electronics and memory technologies, where magnetic 2D materials are expected to play a key role."

"Novel, host-directed, and selective anti-HIV agents Although drugs are currently available for HIV, the virus’ ability to mutate rapidly allows it to acquire resistance to existing drugs that directly target HIV’s own proteins. Rising drug-resistance threatens the long-term effectiveness of current anti-HIV drugs, making the search for new antivirals for HIV a compelling need. A way to overcome drug resistance is to develop antivirals targeting host proteins, such as DDX3X (DEAD-Box Helicase 3, XLinked) that HIV subverts to ‘assist’ the viral life cycle. Current DDX3X inhibitors can limit the
replication of HIV [1, 2], including drug-resistant HIV [3], and are patented (PCT/IB2010/054475; PCT/EP2016/052990), validating DDX3X as an anti-HIV target. The problem with these inhibitors is that they target the highly conserved active site of DDX3X, which is common to all 42 DDX family members; these inhibitors are therefore likely to target multiple human DEAD-Box helicases (DDXs),
with long-term use almost certainly leading to deleterious side-effects/toxicity."

"Overcoming the social stigma of consuming food waste by dining at the Open Table Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems Stigma is often encountered by recipients who receive food donations from charities, while the consumption of wasted food, also traditionally considered to be a stigmatized practice, has recently become part of a popular food rescue movement that seeks to reduce environmental impacts. These two stigmasâ€”charitable donation and the consumption of wasteâ€”are brought together at the Open Table, a community group in Melbourne, Australia, that serves community meals cooked from surplus food. This paper examines how Open Table de-stigmatizes food donations through food waste discourse to enable greater social inclusion. I draw on the experiences of donors, cooks, volunteers and eaters gathered from diverse Open Table sites. Taking a â€˜follow-the-thingâ€™ approach, I analyze how food â€˜wasteâ€™ becomes re-valued by embracing goals of environmental justice enacted through local processes of care and conviviality. Relying on networks of volunteers and not-for-profit agencies, Open Table provides a simple, effective and adaptable model for possible replication for overcoming drawbacks of traditional charity practices. Critically though, as hunger in society continues to grow, this approach is increasingly threatened by the need to â€˜single outâ€™ disadvantaged recipients to justify continued supply. This paper contributes to food poverty, waste, and Alternative Food Network literature in two important ways: first, by analyzing the outcomes of community food redistribution approaches with regards to stigma and inclusion; and secondly, by arguing that such holistic approaches need to be acknowledged, valued and supported to shift current discourses and practice."
"Talaromyces pinophilus strain M13: a portrayal of novel groundbreaking fungal strain for phytointensification Trichoderma Reesei; Enzymes; Penicillium Oxalicum The aim of current research was to explore different fungi as plant growth promoting fungi (PGPF). Strains of Trichoderma are well explored till now. But there are few other fungal strains that are better than Trichoderma strains. The study involves the isolation of different fungi from the rhizosphere of various agriculture farms. After isolation, 18S rRNA identification was carried out. Isolated fungi belonged to genus Penicillium, Talaromyces, Trichoderma, and Aspergillus. Isolate M13 belonging to genus Talaromyces was screened for its plant growth promoting (PGP) activity as it is a novel strain and still to be explored. Isolate M13 was identified as Talaromyces pinophilus (MG011365). Indole acetic acid (IAA) estimation was carried out using Salkowski reagent. Isolate was allowed to grow in cultivation media (Potato Dextrose Broth, PDB) in which one was supplemented with tryptophan (TRP) and one was without TRP. Phosphate solubilization was assessed using Pikovskayaâ€™s media and latter estimated using stannous chloride method, showing decent solubilization of phosphate. Siderophore production was assessed using CAS assay that indicated decent extent of siderophore production. Further for biocontrol, enzymatic assay for Î²-glucanase and chitinase was carried out. For Î²-glucanase enzyme production 1% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and for chitinase enzyme production 10% v/v colloidal chitin (as a sole carbon source) supplemented in solid minimal-medium-9 (MM9) were used. Antagonism effect of isolate M13 was carried out against Aspergillus niger by dual cultural method. As the strain M13 showed several PGP traits, liquid bioformulation was prepared to perform seed germination assay and pot trials on chickpea, followed by field trial on banana plant. All the experimental data of biochemical assessment with pot and field trials suggest T. pinophilus M13 as a novel fungus that can be used as biointensifier."

"Does ESG certification add firm value? Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy This paper examines the impact of environmental, social and governance (ESG) certification on Malaysian firms. The analysis shows that ESG certification lowers a firm's cost of capital, while Tobin's Q increases significantly. These findings, while consistent with existing studies in developed economies, demonstrate the value enhancement from corporate social responsibility disclosure by firms in emerging and developing nations. Overall, the study confirms the benefits to stakeholders from firms pursuing an ESG agenda."

"Modelling the large-scale yellow fever outbreak in Luanda, Angola, and the impact of vaccination Yellow Fever Virus; Brazil; Flaviviridae Background: Yellow fever (YF), transmitted via bites of infected mosquitoes, is a life-threatening viral disease endemic to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and South America. YF has largely been controlled by widespread national vaccination campaigns. Nevertheless, between December 2015 and August 2016, YF resurged in Angola, quickly spread and becoming the largest YF outbreak for the last 30 years. Recently, YF resurged again in Brazil (December 2016). Thus, there is an urgent need to gain better understanding of the transmission pattern of YF. Model: The present study provides a refined mathematical model, combined with modern likelihood-based statistical inference techniques, to assess and reconstruct important epidemiological processes underlying Angolaâ€™s YF outbreak. This includes the outbreakâ€™s attack rate, the reproduction number (R0), the role of the mosquito vector, the influence of climatic factors and the unusual but noticeable appearance of two-waves in the YF outbreak. The model explores actual and hypothetical vaccination strategies, and the impacts of possible human reactive behaviors (e.g., response to media precautions). Findings: While there were 73 deaths reported over the study period, the model indicates that the vaccination campaign saved 5.1-fold more people from death and saved from illness 5.6-fold of the observed 941 cases. Delaying the availability of the vaccines further would have greatly worsened the epidemic in terms of increased case numbers and mortality. The analysis estimated a mean R0 ÍŒ 2:6-3:4 and an estimated YF attack rate of 0.09-0.15% (proportion of population infected by YFV) over the whole period from December 2015 to August 2016. Our estimated lower and upper bounds of R0 are in line with previous studies. Unusually, R0 oscillated in a manner that was â€œdelayedâ€ with the reported deaths. High recent number of deaths were associated (followed) with periods of relatively low disease transmission and low R0, and vice-versa. The time-series of Luandaâ€™s YF cases suggest the outbreak occurred in two waves, a feature that would have become far more prominent had there been no mass vaccination. The waves could possibly be due to protective reactive behavioral changes of the population affecting the mosquito population. The second wave could well be an outcome of the March-April rainfall patterns in the 2016 El NiÃ±o year by creating ideal conditions for the breeding of the mosquito vectors. The modelling framework is a powerful tool for studying future YF epidemic outbreaks, and provides a basis for future vaccination campaign evaluations."
"C4NET Demand Response Initiative – Industrial and Commercial Demand Flexing to Increase Overall Benefit (“INFLEXION”) (Administered by Federation University) Electrical power grids are the largest man-made complex networks globally, where the continuous balancing of the generation and demand is critical for securing reliable system operation. With the increased penetration of renewable generation into the electricity grids, the control from the generation-side is decreasing. That’s why increased flexibility is required from the demand-side to facilitate secure, efficient, and economical operation – which is driving the renewed interest in demand response.
More than 65% of Australia’s electricity is consumed by commercial and industrial (C&I) customers.
Therefore, the large C&I customers have higher potential to facilitate demand response operations and are able to commit and deliver a significant part of the network demand. Subsequently, they incur a large percentage of their operating cost as electricity bills. As the price of electricity is varying over time, the non-optimal scheduling and operation of the load may increase the energy bills and emission
footprint for the C&I customers. Also, the rising electricity costs tend to increase the operational cost of the C&I customers.
In this perspective, the proposed project, INFLEXION (INdustrial and commercial demand FLEXing to Increase Overall beNefit) will focus on the demand response potential and opportunities of the water industry, which is one of the fastest-growing C&I customers, and have a diverse range of presence in the network."

"Data61 PhD scholarship - Data-driven approach to explore pathogen ecology, and transmission paths using signal-processing  and machine-learning methodology (PhD student: Gal Almogy The basic approach to analytically describe the dynamics of disease spread was formulated nearly a century ago by Kermack and McKendrick (1927). In the basic model the population is divided into three categories, Susceptible, Infected and Recovered individuals (SIR model), where the populations are assumed to exhibit 'perfect mixing', allowing for straightforward analytical treatment. Numerous variations on the basic SIR model have been proposed, such as the SIRS models, where immunity is transient (i.e. R 7 S as immunity wanes), SEIR models, accounting for an non-infective 'incubation period' (E = Exposed) etc.
While these SIR models provide a powerful framework for epidemic analysis, it is clear that in most all cases human population is not perfectly mixed; in fact, it has been shown that human societies tend to form characteristic network structures, often corresponding to the analytic definition of a 'small-world network'. Consequently, many recent epidemiological modeling works have taken into account the underlying network structure that forms the 'ecological niche' of communicable diseases, leading to more realistic descriptions of disease spread, some even taking into account real human connectivity data, e.g. air travel data and aggregated cellular location data.
The research hypothesis is that due to the particulars of social interactions, the spatial spread patterns of specific pathogens are often highly heterogeneous even when examined at the city-level. If true, the basic epidemiological units of pathogen transmission are not a 'region' or a 'city', but rather highly localized spatial elements defined by context-specific social interaction dynamics."
"Informal Networks, Informal Institutions, and Social Exclusion in the Workplace: Insights from Subsidiaries of Multinational Corporations in Korea Guanxi; China; Managerial Ties Drawing on interviews with decision makers in multinational corporations (MNCs) in South Korea, we examine the role of informal networks in the social exclusion of women in the workforce. Although legislation in the country is in favor of gender equality, we found that informal barriers in the workplace remain difficult to overcome. Informal networks in Korea, yongo, present an ethical issue in the workplace, as they tend to socially exclude women, limiting possibilities for their participation and career progression. We found that informal networks are pervasive and strong because of the informal institutions in which they are embedded and that there is a complex interplay between informal networks and informal institutions that socially excludes women. Due to difficulties accessing yongo, women appear to build inmaek, a network type that is more open and accessible. We also found that MNCs in Korea can compensate for the lack of local informal networks for their female employees. However, despite providing a more supportive environment for women at work, gender equality policies in MNCs are not yet as effective as they could be due to the dynamics of the workplace and the fact that the policies are not tailored to the local context. We have seen evidence in recent years that MNCs can serve as role models for implementing gender equality policies by creating a more inclusive work environment and demonstrating leadership commitment and support."

"Effect of community road infrastructure, socio-demographic and street pattern in promoting walking as sustainable transportation mode Built Environment; Mode Choice; Urban Form Background: Traffic demand is growing worldwide and the increased carbon emission from transport and travel activities is contributing to greenhouse gas emission and climate change. As the oil and gas capital of Canada, the city of Calgary has a very high carbon footprint per population and the reduction of automobile use is an important policy goal for the city. Walking, a part of active transportation promotes sustainable transportation initiative by reducing greenhouse gas emission. To encourage walking, favorable walking environment should be ensured which largely depends on street pattern and connectivity. However, the effect of street pattern on walking at community level was not explored much in previous studies, particularly at rapidly expanding city such as Calgaryâ€™s context. Aims and Objectives: The study identifies the effects of different neighborhood design and planning factors associated with the share of walking in work trips while controlling for differences in social economic characteristics of the neighborhood. Methods: A linear regression model was developed using community-level data from the 2011 census and the road infrastructure data of Calgary. Results: Our study finds that different street patterns and types of land use, length of train tracks, number of train stations and number of schools have significant effect on walking. Conclusion: Thus, different neighbourhood street patterns and land uses should be considered in the development of new communities for promoting active and sustainable transportation."
"Short-term effects of a sewage sludge biochar amendment on total and available heavy metal content of a tropical soil Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon The production of biochar is a technological alternative to transform sewage sludge (SS) into a useful product for agro-environmental purposes. Despite an increased knowledge on the role of sewage sludge biochar (SSB) for improving soil quality and crop productivity, some concerns remain regarding the accumulation of total and available heavy metals (HM) in soils amended with SSB. Particularly, there is a dearth of studies under field conditions and in tropical latitudes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of applying SS biochars, prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures, on the accumulation and availability of heavy metals (HM). To do so, 15 Mg ha âˆ’1 of SS biochar produced at 300 Â°C (BC300) and 500 Â°C (BC500) were applied to a soil cultivated with corn. Total and available levels of HM in SS, biochars and post-harvest soil were determined. Pyrolysis concentrated total HM in the biochars in relation to the SS. However, HM availability was reduced with increasing pyrolysis temperature due to an increase in pH, pore volume, specific surface area, P and K content, and reduction of the H/C ratio. Biochar did not alter the total HM contents, with the exception of Mn. Available levels of all HM in the soil were <1.2% of the total contents. In addition, the available levels of Zn and Mn, when evaluated as micronutrients, were considered low. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that biochar produced from SS of a sewage treatment plant processing predominantly domestic sewage can be used in agriculture, without risk of soil contamination by HM. Moreover, in some tropical soils, with a low value of micronutrients, biochar can provide a source of these elements."

"A new generation of energy storage electrode materials constructed from carbon dots Electrode; Cobaltous Sulfide; Electrode Materials Carbon dots (CDs), an emerging class of carbon materials, hold a promising future in a broad variety of engineering fields owing to their high diversity in structure, composition and properties. Recently, their potential applications have spanned from bio-imaging, fluorescent probing and catalysis, to energy storage fields, in particular as materials in the key components of electrochemical energy storage devices. The state-of-the-art research work has revealed that CD-based or modified electrodes exhibit profound improvement in all key functions, such as coulombic efficiency, cycling life, enlarging capacity, etc., in comparison to traditional electrodes. The improvement in all these properties can be realized by introducing a small quantity of CDs to the traditional electrode systems. A comparative optimization in this regard, however, requires incorporation of more carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene or other carbon-based materials, indicating that CD-incorporated electrode materials would maintain their energy density more efficiently. This review will summarize the progress to date in the design and preparation of CD-incorporated energy storage devices, including supercapacitors, Li/Na/K-ion batteries, Li-S batteries, metal-air batteries and flow batteries, and elaborate on the influence of these unique structures and rich properties of CDs on the electrochemical performance of the resulting electrodes and devices. Consequently, the specific functions and the novel working mechanisms of CD-modified electrodes for energy storage units will be discussed, aiming at providing new insights for guidance for design and manufacturing of the next generation of electrode materials for high-performance energy storage."

"Infrastructure Financing for Climate Change Adaptation in Australia: Practitioners’ Perspectives Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience With increased climate-related risks and natural disasters, impacts on infrastructure assets are intensifying. As the need for adaptation actions increase, how finance is used to enable adaptation plays a vital role in the resilience of infrastructure. This research aims to understand how infrastructure adaptation measures are carried out, focusing on how financing is used to aid such efforts. Exploratory interviews with infrastructure and finance practitioners from a broad range of organisations were conducted to understand the dynamics of how infrastructure adaptation occurs. The findings reveal that infrastructure agencies conduct adaptation activities to maintain the serviceability of assets under climate change risks, with most climate financing targeting mitigation rather than adaptation. Most actions are taken at individual asset or agency level with little collaboration across agencies and sectors. The results illustrate a need for a more holistic, systems-level approach to adaptation across the infrastructure sector in Australia."
"Fame, What's your name? quasi and statistical gender discrimination in an art valuation experimentc Ethnic Discrimination; Job Applications; Field Experiment We conduct five experimental studies to examine whether and what kind of gender discrimination explains deep and persistent gender gaps in the art market. 1112 participants chose between male and female-originated artworks with and without artist information. Gender-specific artist names did not affect personal preferences or preference norms. They did however cause significant swings towards male artworks when participants were incentivised to guess the more pedigreed or more expensive artwork. When artist name information was controlled, manipulating artist fame information shifted preference norms towards artworks of males, who are more famous on average. Overall we find no taste-based but significant statistical gender discrimination. We also find quasi gender discrimination, in which discrimination based on a particular characteristic (fame) may be falsely attributed to a highly-correlated one (gender)."

"Improving drought resilience in Northern Murray-Darling Basin farming communities: Is forecast-based financing suitable? Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China A trend towards drier conditions during the April to October â€˜coolâ€™ season across southern Australia has been observed in the past few decades. Frequent and prolonged droughts have a significant impact on the financial stability of affected farming communities. Forecast-based Financing (FbF) is a novel proactive aid approach that provides support measures to increase resilience during the window between drought early warnings, and the actual onset and intensification of drought. Using the Northern Murray-Darling Basin as a case study, we investigated whether FbF combined with a user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought has the potential to increase the drought resilience of Australian farming communities. This study shows that farming businesses most impacted by drought have three common factors: (i) lower levels of business management skills, (ii) lower levels of pre-drought preparedness during non-drought periods, and (iii) slower responses when the intensity of drought increases. The results suggest that FbF in its current form is not recommended for a market economy such as Australia, as forms of direct assistance may have adverse long-term effects through disrupting the market itself and may not encourage farm operators to regularly assess and adapt their drought management strategies. Results also suggest that providing farmers, service providers, and all levels of government with tools that incorporate a user-centred I-EWS for drought can improve overall decision-making before, during, and even after drought. This change from a reactive to a proactive approach to managing drought impacts can be a highly effective form of increasing the drought resilience of farming communities."
"‘Care’ as camouflaging capitalism and obscuring harm: The user-generated pornography market and women's inequality Erotica; Porn; Sexual Behavior With the pornography industry's shift to platforms and a business model that heavily relies on user-generated content, there is a need to better understand how this industry sells itself to women as self-producing â€œcontent creatorsâ€, especially considering the sexualised violence involved in marketing content to consumers. As one way to unpack some of the strategic underpinnings and market dynamics of this newer production model, we introduce an institutional logics approach to analyse materials from five pornography platform websites. We find the dominant integration of a theme of â€œcareâ€ is being sold to women; which both works to camouflage this market and its capitalist norms, while also functioning to obfuscate this market's harm. Our study is significant in mapping some of the more disguised, blurred and paradoxical practices of this user-generated market while also revealing the newer ways women's harm and inequality is being (re)produced in the selling of self-production."

"Direct conversion of CO2to solid carbon by Ga-based liquid metals Carbon Dioxide; Electrocatalysts; Chemical Reduction The direct conversion of CO2 to carbon is a highly providential route; however, conventional thermal and catalytic approaches are hindered by high energy demands and are limited by coking. Here, we report a robust and highly selective method for the direct conversion of CO2 to solid carbon over EGaIn liquid metal (LM) alloy. We utilized the low-melting point of this alloy to facilitate the reduction of CO2 at low temperatures, producing 319 Î¼mol h-1 of carbon at 200 Â°C, and remarkably enabling CO2 activation and carbon production even at room temperature, without the use of a supplementary reductant such as hydrogen. The deployed LM showed no signs of deactivation by coking and the generated carbon is shown to naturally accumulate at the top of the LM where it can be easily collected. In situ XPS measurements indicate an increase of 9.6% in the carbon-carbon bond content and an equivalent decrease in the Ga metal content, upon exposure of the LM to CO2 for 30 mins at 200 Â°C and 1 bar. This led to the conclusion that solid carbon and gallium oxide are the final reaction products of this process. Density functional theory calculations shed further light on the adsorption and dissociation of CO2 over Ga and EGaIn. The presented method creates a pathway to transforming CO2 to perpetually stored solid carbon and can therefore set a trajectory for making a measurable impact on carbon intensive industries."
"Understanding and measuring the socio-ecological benefits of greening actions Ecological surveys
A first key step will be to inventory the plant species occurring at each site ? before and after the greening actions take place. We then implement the following three types of surveys: (i) direct observation of plant-insect pollinator interactions, (ii) direct observation of plant-bird behavioural interactions, and (iii) sweep-netting of insect species on above-ground vegetation. Surveys will be temporally replicated
at least three times during each year of the study, which will allow us to generate the necessary replication data to account for the imperfect detection of species/interactions.
Qualitative social surveys
We will build on an established interdisciplinary framework that identifies the broad range of health, wellbeing and psycho-social outcomes associated with urban greenspace. We will use a longitudinal mixed-method qualitative design to compare baseline and short-term outcomes the greening actions that will transform Sheils Reserve into a formal parkland broadly accessible by the public and local residents. Using a pre- and post- design we will evaluate the relationships between a range of site and social factors that may influence the outcomes of the greening actions. We will use qualitative interviews with residents pre- and post- greening actions to understand the impacts and use of Sheils Reserve and how the new, more biodiverse greenspace impacts use, connection with place or nature, and health and wellbeing outcomes."

"Discussion forums: A misnomer? Examining lurkers, engagement and academic achievement Distance Education; Social Presence; Online Discussion Discussion forums are often touted as maximising student participation and learning but concerns around engagement counter any perceived benefits. Often participation is the measure of engagement, and students who do not post are deemed unengaged. To further examine engagement and forums as learning communities, we used analytic data from 270 students enrolled in two online psychology subjects using social network analysis and interviewed 22 students. Both subjectsâ€™ forums had greater egalitarian triads, indicative of reciprocal relationships. Furthermore, both active posters and lurkers had a mix of grade bands indicating that some lurkers still achieved academically. Lurking was a key qualitative theme along with checking for assessment information and intimidation. For both subjects, students were engaged with the forums, and differences in connectivity were consistent with the different subject content. However, forum activity indicated that these forums were more like subscription services than communities of practice. We propose that forums can be transformed into dynamic teaching spaces through understanding the multidimensionality of engagement, setting the expectation and tone of the forum as a safe place, and enhancing the platforms so visible indicators show that posts have been read or consumed. We further propose that students who engage but do not post be called quiet participants. Implications for practice or policy: â€¢ Educators and researchers can improve the understanding of engagement with discussion forums by acknowledging the distinction between participation and engagement. â€¢ Online providers can assist in transforming these online platforms into dynamic teaching tools through enhancements that indicate a post has been read. â€¢ Educators can increase engagement by setting the tone and expectations for the forum. â€¢ Replacing the negative term lurker with quiet participants better reflects the activity of these students."

"Review on research on concrete beam reinforced with HB-FRP Strengthening; Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics; Debonding To summarize the research results of hybrid bonding fibre reinforced plastic (HB-FRP) reinforcement method and promote its broader application in the field of concrete beam repair and reinforcement, the research status of HB-FRP reinforcement method was investigated. The debonding problem of external bonding FRP under external loads and environmental erosion was revealed. The working mechanism of HB-FRP reinforcement in inhibiting debonding after FRP reinforcement was explained. The structural characteristics of HB-FRP reinforcement system and its influence on the interface bonding performance were analyzed. Existing bonding-slip and debonding load models were summarized. The flexural and shear performance of reinforced beam was studied. The shortcomings of existing studies were analyzed, and future research directions and ideas were prospected. Analysis result shows that both external loads and environmental erosion may induce the debonding of FRP. HB-FRP reinforcement combines the chemical bonding, friction and dowel effect to inhibit the FRP debonding effectively. The main difference among several current HB-FRP bond-slip relationships is whether a stable FRP slip occurs when the interfacial bonding strength is reached. The limit debonding load of the bonding interface depends on its bond-slip relationship. HB-FRP reinforcement can be used for the flexural resistance of normal section and the shear resistance of oblique section, and the bearing capacity and reinforcement efficiency of reinforced beam improve significantly. Increasing the FRP amount and the number of steel fasteners can effectively improve the flexural resistance of reinforced beam. The influence of steel fastener spacing on the bearing capacity of reinforced beam and the reinforcement design criteria are still unclear. The crack and external load have significant effects on the debonding load, material utilization rate, and failure mode of reinforced beam. The increase in the shear strength of reinforced beam mainly generated by the shear forces provided by the FRP and concrete, whereas the influence of stirrup is minimal. The increase in the FRP reinforcement amount and the decrease in the strip spacing can significantly improve the shear capacity of reinforced beam. Follow-up studies on the HB-FRP reinforcement design theory should be continued to propose calculation models for bonding characteristics considering the material and structural characteristics and develop a design method for HB-FRP steel fastener spacing based on the interfacial shear force. Furthermore, the optimized flexure and shear resistance design methods and design formulas for HB-FRP reinforced concrete beams should be developed. 2 tabs, 9 figs, 68 refs."
"University buildings: The push and pull for sustainability Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Universities are a key stakeholder in our built environment with buildings in many major cities around Australia and the world. Due to their primarily urban locations, size and number of staff and students, universities and their activities are a significant contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. Increasingly universities both in Australia and globally are looking for ways to improve their sustainability outcomes. This recognizes that higher education institutions can do more to help in the transition to a low-carbon future, but also that by adopting sustainability initiatives, universities help reduce operating costs and facilitate healthier and more productive staff and students. This chapter explores the role of universities and their sustainability initiatives including their challenges of servicing complex stakeholders in a transition to a low-carbon future. After discussing relevant policies and rating tools, five key examples that go significantly beyond minimum performance requirements from prominent Australian universities are presented. Evident from the examples is that there continues to be no one-size-fits-all approach for universities to become more sustainable. It will require complex considerations of the requirements of the university anticipated future needs as well as a wide-ranging evaluation of the most appropriate pathways forward. Ultimately, it is encouraging to see key universities engaging more seriously with improving sustainability outcomes, not only in Australia but also globally. Universities have the opportunity to not just improve sustainability of their facilities, but to also demonstrate to their hundreds of thousands of students and staff how the built environment can be designed to benefit both the environment and the occupants."

"The boy in a dress: A spectre for our times Young; Sex Education; Sexuality This article draws upon theories of gender, nation and haunting in order to examine what we term the spectre of the boy in a dress within two international contexts, Sweden and Australia. These two contexts have been chosen because, on the surface, they appear to be very different and yet as our analysis will reveal there are striking similarities around gender conformity discourse and nation, although they play out differently. We illustrate how the notion of the boy in a dress is drawn upon as a problematic figure within these two different socio-political contexts, and argue that this figure represents a â€˜tipping pointâ€™ between the tolerance and intolerance of gender diversity within public and educational spaces. Two key moments will be analysed. In Australia, the recent (2017) postal survey on Marriage Equality saw a campaign run from a conservative right group, the Coalition for Marriage, that included a television commercial featuring a concerned mother stating that, â€˜School told my son he could wear a dress to school if he likesâ€™. In Sweden, in 2016, the department store Ã…hlÃ©ns chose an image of a child of African heritage and indeterminate gender to be the face of their annual Lucia marketing. This caused significant controversy and sparked a â€˜Jag Ã¤r Luciaâ€™ (I am Lucia) campaign featuring notable Swedish celebrities dressed as Lucia, including footballer Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ‡. These critical incidents act as illustration of how the power of cisgender normativity intersects with notions about the nation, within educational spaces and public consciousness."

"Flexible employment policies, temporal control and health promoting practices: A qualitative study in two Australian worksites Work-Family Conflict; Work-Life Balance; Personnel For four decades, theories of job demand-control have proposed that higher occupational status groups have lower health risks due to the stress accompanying jobs featuring high demands but high control. This research examines whether Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) can improve the health prospects of a range of workers by giving greater control over work time arrangements. Our setting is Australia, where FWAs were introduced in 2009. In line with these early studies alongside studies of work-life balance, we expected to observe that workers with access to control over daily work times could better control the activities outside of work that influence chronic disease. Using a practice sociology approach, we compared the accounts of twenty-eight workers in blue and white collar industries with differing degrees of work time flexibility. The findings do not contradict early theories describing occupational differences of job demand-control dynamics and their relationship to health risks. However, this study suggests that a) time demands and strains have increased for a broad sweep of workers since the 1980s, b) the greater control of higher occupational status groups has been eroded by the high performance movement, which has attracted less scrutiny than FWAs, and c) more workers are forced to adapt their daily lives, including their approach to health, to accommodate their job demands. Job insecurity further impedes preventative health practices adoption. What might appear to be worker-controlled flexibility can-under the pressures of job insecurity and performance expectations without time limits-transform into health-eroding unpredictability. The answer however is not greater flexibility in the absence of limits on the well-documented precursors of work stress: long hours, job insecurity and intensity-related exhaustion. While there have been welcome developments in job demand-control-health conceptualizations, they typically ignore the out-of-work temporal demands that workers face and which compound on-the-job demands. Redesign of the temporalities of working life within worksites need to be accompanied by society-level policies which address caring responsibilities, gender equality as well as broad labour market conditions."

"Trace-Level Fluorination of Mesoporous TiO2Improves Photocatalytic and Pb(II) Adsorbent Performances Photocatalytic Activity; Facet; Titanium Dioxide Fluorination is an effective way of tuning the physicochemical property and activity of TiO2 nanocrystallites, which usually requires a considerable amount of hydrofluoric acid (or NH4F) for a typical F/Ti molar ratio, RF, of 0.5-69.0 during synthesis. This has consequential environmental issues due to the high toxicity and hazard of the reactants. In the present work, an environmentally benign fluorination approach is demonstrated that uses only a trace amount of sodium fluoride with an RF of 10-6 during synthesis. While it maintained the desirable high surface area (102.4 m2/g), the trace-level fluorination enabled significant enhancements on photocatalytic activities (e.g., a 56% increase on hydrogen evolution rate) and heavy metal Pb(II) removal (31%) of the mesoporous TiO2. This can be attributed to enriched Ti3+ and localized spatial charge separation due to fluorination as proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and density functional theory (DFT) analyses."

"Australian graduates’ work readiness – deficiencies, causes and potential solutions Employability; Competency; Soft Skills Purpose: It is widely reported that there is a competence deficit between graduating from Australian higher education (HE) and becoming work ready and that the deficit is becoming more pronounced. The purpose of this paper is to examine the work readiness competencies of Australian HE and vocational education (VE) graduates. The reported competence deficits, the causes of these deficits and the potential strategies to overcome these deficits are discussed. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative, inductive research design was used to examine Australian graduatesâ€™ work readiness competence, potential deficits, their causes and possible solutions to gain some preliminary insights and help shape future research. A multiple case design was used comprising key stakeholdersâ€™ in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. In-depth semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were conducted to gain insights from the key stakeholders. Findings: The stakeholders reported that the Australian VE and HE sectors do not sufficiently prepare graduates in terms of their work readiness skills. Self-management skills, communication (written and expression), team-work skills, cognitive skills, system thinking and innovation and creativity were the main work readiness competency deficits reported by the stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: The research has its limitations in terms of the limited sample and time frame, and the absence of input from graduates. The results of the study indicate the deteriorating state of the Australian graduate labour market and emphasise that an integrated approach is urgently required from all stakeholders to facilitate the transition and reduce the time taken from graduation to employment. Originality/value: The focus of the study is located in the Australian labour market in terms of the competencies that reportedly are present upon graduation and the competencies that employers are looking for on recruitment. The requisite competency list and the deficits are examined through the lens of four stakeholder groups; government representatives, industry representatives and VE and HE representatives."

"Global Resource Assessments of Primary Metals: An Optimistic Reality Check Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals The mining of primary metals is critical for a range of modern infrastructure and goods and the continuing growth in global population and consumption means that these primary metals are expected to remain in high demand. However, metallic deposits are, in essence, finite and non-renewableâ€”leading to some concern that we may run out of a given metal in the future. Here, we address this concern by presenting a brief review of the reporting of mineral resource estimates, compiling detailed datasets for national and global trends in mineral resources for numerous metals, and present detailed case studies of major mining projects or fields. The evidence clearly shows strong growth in known mineral resources and cumulative production over time rather than any evidence of gradual resource depletion. In addition, the key factors that already govern existing mining projects and mineral resources are certainly social, environmental and economic in nature rather than geological or related to physical resource depletion. Overall, there is great room for optimism in terms of humankindâ€™s ability to supply future generations with the metals they will require."

"Water desalination using graphene nanopores: Influence of the water models used in simulations Water Desalination; Nanopores; Water Molecular dynamics simulations are widely employed to analyze water and ion permeation through nanoporous membranes for reverse osmosis applications. In such simulations, water models play an important role in accurately reproducing the properties of water. We investigated the water and ion transport across a hydroxyl (OH) functionalized graphene nanopore using six water models: SPC, SPC/E, SPC/Fw, TIP3P, TIP4P, and TIP4P/2005. The water flux thus obtained varied up to 84% between the models. The water and ion flux showed a correlation with the bulk transport properties of the models such as the diffusion coefficient and shear viscosity. We found that the hydrogen-bond lifetime, resulting from the partial charges of the model, influenced the flux. Our results are useful in the selection of a water model for computer simulations of desalination using nanomembranes. Our findings also suggest that lowering the hydrogen-bond lifetime and enhancing the rate of diffusion of water would lead to enhanced water/ion flux."

"A unique permeate gap membrane distillation system for combined fresh water and power production Distillation; Direct Contact; Membrane The low-energy consumption process appears as one of the most dominant priority for sustainable fresh water production in recent years. Membrane distillation (MD) can be adapted effectively for water desalination due to lower operating temperature and ability to integrate to low grade waste heat. In this work, the feasibility of combined water and power production (CWP) is investigated by a unique permeate gap (PGMD) module. The permeate gap hydraulic pressure is controlled by connecting the permeate outlet to a sealed pressurized tank. Furthermore, the effect of permeate hydraulic pressure on the permeate flux and power density are explored experimentally. The maximum hydraulic pressure within this setup by polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane was around 2 bar. It is demonstrated that under 80 Â°C and 15 Â°C of the fluid bulk temperatures in the inlet of hot and cold sides, respectively an optimum permeates hydraulic pressure of 1.1 bar, 12.5 kg/m2 h of permeate flux, 0.4 W/m2 of power density and 0.03 kWh/m3 of specific energy production (SEP) are achievable. This capacity of power generation has been accompanied by around 50% permeate flux reduction. The achieved results propose the system potential to produce higher SEP rate, via implementation of the advanced hydrophobic membranes with the higher-pressure resistance feature."

"Thermal sensor performance and fire characterisation during short duration engulfment tests Protective Clothing; Firefighting Gear; Fire Fighters A small-scale reproduction of the ISO 13506-1 thermal manikin was constructed to enable the assessment of manikin sensor performance, the partitioning of energy, and the variability of the fire generated during short duration heat and flame engulfment tests. The cylindrical test apparatus simultaneously housed four total heat flux (THF) sensors, one radiant heat flux sensor, and three manikin sensors. Calibrated manikin sensors were provided by nine laboratories and were categorised as buried thermocouple, copper-based, or surface-mounted thermocouple sensors. The test apparatus was exposed to fire generated by four propane torches for three exposure durations. All sensors presented similar profiles in net heat flux over time, which could be divided into four distinct phases: transient increase, pseudo-steady state, transient decrease, and post-exposure. Over pseudo-steady state, the mean THF over all exposure durations was 88 Â± 8 kW/m2, and the ratio of convective to radiant energy was approximately 50:50, but highly variable. For a 4-second exposure, manikin sensors from five laboratories had a bias in heat flux greater than Â± 5% during pseudo-steady state when compared with the THF sensors. This bias can primarily be attributed to the sensitivity of the manikin sensors to convective heat or heat loss due to sensor design."

"Governance and planning in a ‘perfect storm’: Securitising climate change, migration and Covid-19 in Sweden Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience The article describes and reflects upon how multi-level governance and planning in Sweden have been affected by and reacted upon three pending major challenges confronting humanity, namely climate change, migration and the Covid-19 pandemic. These â€˜crisesâ€™ are broadly considered â€˜existential threatsâ€™ in need of â€˜securitisationâ€™. Causes and adequate reactions are contested, and there are no given solutions how to securitise the perceived threats, neither one by one, no less together. Government securitisation strategies are challenged by counter-securitisation demands, and plaguing vulnerable groups in society by in-securitising predicaments. Taking Sweden as an example the article applies an analytical approach drawing upon strands of securitisation, governance and planning theory. Targeting policy responses to the three perceived crises the intricate relations between government levels, responsibilities, capacities, and actions are scrutinized, including a focus upon the role of planning. Overriding research questions are: How has the governance and planning system â€“ central, regional and local governments - in Sweden responded to the challenges of climate change, migration and Covid-19? What threats were identified? What solutions were proposed? What consequences could be traced? What prospects wait around the corner? Comparing crucial aspects of the crisesâ€™ anatomies the article adds to the understanding of the way multilevel, cross-sectional, hybrid governance and planning respond to concurrent crises, thereby also offering clues for action in other geopolitical contexts. The article mainly draws upon recent and ongoing research on manifestations of three cases in the Swedish context. Applying a pragmatic, methodological approach combining elements of securitisation, governance and planning theories with Carol Lee Bacchi's â€˜What is the problem represented to beâ€™ and a touch of interpretive/narrative theory, the study reveals distinct differences between the anatomies of the three crises and their handling. Urgency, extension, state of knowledge/epistemology, governance and planning make different imprints on crises management. Sweden's long-term climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies imply slow, micro-steps forward based on a combination of social-liberal, â€˜circularâ€™ and a touch of â€˜green growthâ€™ economies. Migration policy displays a Janus face, on the one hand largely respecting the UN refugee quota system on the other hand applying a detailed regulatory framework causing severe insecurity especially for minor refugees wanting to stay and make their living in Sweden. The Covid-19 outbreak revealed a lack of foresight and eroded/fragmented responsibility causing huge stress upon personnel in elderly and health care and appalling death rates among elderly patients, although governance and planning slowly adapted through securitising policies, leading to potential de-securitisation of the issue. The three crises have caused a security wake-up among governments at all levels and the public in general, and the article concludes by discussing whether this â€˜perfect stormâ€™ of crises will result in a farewell to neoliberalism â€“ towards a neo-regulatory state facing further challenges and crises for governance, planning and the role of planners. The tentative prospect rather indicates a mixture of context-dependent â€˜hybrid governanceâ€™, thus also underlining the crucial role of plannersâ€™ role as â€˜chameleonsâ€™ in complicated governance processes of politics, policy and planning."

"Rapid adsorption of PFAS: Application of Moringa oleifera seed powder encapsulated in alginate beads Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Adsorption processes are increasingly used for removing perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from aqueous systems. However, issues including slow adsorption kinetics, competition with other organics such as humic substances, and the fact that many commercial adsorbents are sourced from non-renewable materials can hinder their application. Calcium alginate beads with integrated Moringa oleifera (MO) seed powder were investigated as an alternative adsorbent for addressing these issues. The beads fabricated under different formulation conditions were evaluated as a proof of concept for their adsorption performance of two PFAS compounds (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS)) that are frequently found in PFAS-contaminated water. The beads exhibited fast kinetics with equilibrium reached in 30 min and a high adsorption capacity (up to 941.7 Î¼g gâˆ’1) for PFOS. The presence of humic acid (HA) did not greatly affect PFOS adsorption, demonstrating the potential of the beads as a promising adsorbent for long-chain PFAS removal from aqueous streams. The results of adsorption experiments and adsorbent characterization indicated that PFAS adsorption was dominated by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The adsorption efficiency appeared to be related to Câ€“F chain length as the removal efficiency of the short-chain PFAS compound (PFBS) was found to be lower than 10%."

"Urban Food Infrastructures: The Role of Inner-City Universities Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems Urban food infrastructures are oft-forgotten as crucial for sustainability transitions. This ethnographic case study explores the eating spaces of an inner-city university to assess its sustainability outcomes. By considering knowledge as embedded in and through social practices as â€œgeneral understandingsâ€, the paper argues that the neo-liberal organisation of eating spaces understands campus spaces as assets, conceives students as individualistic consumers, and outsources sustainability initiatives. The paper contends that these understandings have established a dominant pathway for retail prioritised, gentrified and uni-functional eating spaces, marginalising some existing hybrid and convivial food infrastructures that may be pathways for sustainable and just outcomes. æ‘˜è¦: åŸŽå¸‚é£Ÿå“åŸºç¡€è®¾æ–½ï¼Œå¦‚åŸŽå¸‚å†…çš„å¤§å­¦é¥®é£Ÿç©ºé—´ï¼Œå¾€å¾€è¢«è®¤ä¸ºæ˜¯å‘å¯æŒç»­ç¤¾ä¼šè¿‡æ¸¡çš„å…³é”®ã€‚è¿™ä¸ªå¯¹å¢¨å°”æœ¬å¸‚å†…ä¸€æ‰€å¤§å­¦çš„äººç§å­¦æ¡ˆä¾‹ç ”ç©¶ï¼ŒæŽ¢è®¨äº†å¤§å­¦çš„é¥®é£Ÿç©ºé—´å’Œç©ºé—´ç®¡ç†ï¼Œä»¥è¯„ä¼°å¯æŒç»­æ€§çš„ç»“æžœã€‚é€šè¿‡å°†çŸ¥è¯†åµŒå…¥å¹¶é€šè¿‡ç¤¾ä¼šå®žè·µä½œä¸º â€œä¸€èˆ¬ç†è§£â€ï¼Œæœ¬æ–‡è®¤ä¸ºï¼Œå¤§å­¦é¥®é£Ÿç©ºé—´çš„æ–°è‡ªç”±ä¸»ä¹‰ç»„ç»‡å°†æ˜‚è´µçš„æ ¡å›­ç©ºé—´ç†è§£ä¸ºä¸€ç§èµ„äº§ï¼Œå°†å­¦ç”Ÿè§†ä¸ºä¸ªäººä¸»ä¹‰çš„æ¶ˆè´¹è€…ï¼Œå¹¶å°†å¯æŒç»­æ€§å€¡è®®å¤–åŒ…ã€‚è¿™äº›ç†è§£ä¸ºé›¶å”®ä¸šçš„ä¼˜å…ˆåŒ–ã€ç»…å£«åŒ–å’Œå•ä¸€åŠŸèƒ½çš„é¥®é£Ÿç©ºé—´å»ºç«‹äº†ä¸€æ¡ä¸»è¦çš„é€”å¾„ã€‚å¦å¤–ï¼Œæœ¬æ–‡æå‡ºï¼Œä¸€äº›è¢«è¾¹ç¼˜åŒ–çš„æ··åˆåž‹å’Œä¼‘é—²åž‹é£Ÿå“åŸºç¡€è®¾æ–½å¯èƒ½ä¸ºå¯æŒç»­çš„å’Œå…¬æ­£çš„ç»“æžœæä¾›æ›¿ä»£é€”å¾„ã€‚."

"‘I wanted to see if you are one of us’: The role of identity in the migration experience, a case study of Latin Americans in Australia Economics; Dutch Disease; Emigration and Immigration The literature on transnational migrations tells us that new migrants often look for points of similarity and familiarity with people in destination countries. Whether they intend to settle permanently or if they are transient and tempo-rary, new migrants whatever their histories (e.g., as forced, lifestyle, economic, worker and study migrants) look to create connections with people in destination countries. These connections allow migrants to feel a sense of belonging through established or new community networks that anchor them in their adopted/host country. Moreover, these connections provide practical benefit in terms of allowing migrants to access sources of support (e.g., emotional) and information that are useful in navigating everyday life in the new country. Often, the connections that migrants make are with fellow migrants who are from the same country of origin or migrants from elsewhere primarily because of their shared migration experi-ence. This shared migration experience though is subject to variables such as socio-economic class, education levels, religious affiliation and gender, or a combination of these, just to name a few. For migrants, connecting with people who they iden-tify and recognize as fellow migrant actors, in other words, is a common, if not, instinctual occurrence for migrant belonging-making. While this article acknowl-edges the significance of the identity-migrant nexus by referring to two separate research projects conducted in Australia involving Latin American participants as a case study, it observes that migrants may also seek out those who they perceive to be fellow co-national/co-ethnic migrants through conventional or perceived visual and cultural markers."

"A temporal assessment of microplastics distribution on the beaches of three remote islands of the Yasawa archipelago, Fiji Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter This is the first study that investigated the presence, distribution, and composition of microplastics, MPs (1-5 mm) on beaches in the Yasawa Islands, Fiji. A temporal assessment over three years on six beaches was undertaken to investigate different beach traits on MP abundance. Average MP concentration was 4.5 Â± 11.1 MPsÂ·mâˆ’2 with significantly higher concentrations were found on east-facing beaches than west (p < 0.001), and higher on the storm line compared to the high tide line (p < 0.001). No difference was found between tourist and local beaches (p = 0.21). These results demonstrate the role of current-driven ocean transport of plastic pollution in this part of The South Pacific. ATR FT-IR analysis showed that across all sites 34 % of MPs were polypropylene (PP), 33 % polystyrene (PS), 25 % polyethylene (PE), and 8 % other polymer types. Further studies are needed to assess the potential impacts of MPs on Fiji's coral reefs and marine life."

"Sustainable development carbon pricing initiative and voluntary environmental disclosures quality Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Although corporate environmental disclosures have been researched extensively, empirical evidence regarding the indirect impact of carbon pricing on firms' voluntary disclosures is scarce. The objective of this study is to identify the indirect impact of carbon pricing initiatives on the voluntary environmental disclosures (VEDs) of electricity generating companies, analyzed through the lens of institutional theory. This study adds to the growing literature on the determinants of VED, investigating the impact of adoption of the Global Reporting Initiative and ISO 14001 on VED. Secondary data were collected from 2015 annual reports and/or standalone sustainability reports of electricity generating companies from 53 countries around the world. Content analysis approach was adopted for measuring the extent of the quality of VED. Findings of multiple regression analysis suggest that there is an indirect institutional impact of carbon pricing on the quality of VED. This study also finds that, as the form of nongovernment guidance, the Global Reporting Initiative adoption and ISO 14001 certification also have an institutional influence on the VED. VED is also affected by company size although this study reveals no significant relationship of leverage with VED."

"Local urban climate governance in Nepal: The interplay between national governments and aid agencies Aid; Official Development Assistance; International Cooperation Multi-lateral aid come from various Bilateral-aid agencies that play a crucial role in supporting developing nations around the world to address climate change issues. Despite significant effort from aid agencies, it is not clear how aid is received and distributed at local level in recipient countries. This paper highlights some of the challenges associated with funding obtained and utilised particularly to address climate change adaptation via case study of Kathmandu, Nepal. This empirical research is funded by the Government of Australia. This research draws on PhD research including a review of the literature and in-depth interviews with governing actors such as local planners in Kathmandu, climate experts, academics, and community members. The study focused on understanding the impacts of international and aid agency investment in climate action at the local urban scale. Key findings reveal that over the past decade significant resources were spent in capacity building programs nationally, but with limited contribution at the level of local adaptation in the urban regions. Local governing agencies and authorities have little capacity to address urban scale needs. Results of the study suggest that the process of distributing aid funding and evaluation of its impact is not transparent. This raised a number of questions around the legitimacy of governing climate change adaptation programs from the top down."

"Spatial Distribution of Novel and Legacy Brominated Flame Retardants in Soils Surrounding Two Australian Electronic Waste Recycling Facilities Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Hexabromocyclododecane; Bromine Informal recycling of electronic waste (e-waste) has been shown to cause significant brominated flame retardant (BFR) contamination of surrounding soils in a number of Asian and West African countries. However, to the authors' knowledge, there have been no published studies demonstrating polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) and novel brominated flame retardant (NBFR) soil contamination from regulated ""formal"" e-waste processing facilities in developed countries. This study reports on PBDEs (-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -154, -183, and -209) and NBFRs (PBT, PBEB, HBB, EH-TBB, BTBPE and DBDPE) in 36 soil samples surrounding two Australian e-waste recycling plants and a further eight reference soils. Overall Î£PBDE concentrations ranged 0.10-98 000 ng/g dw (median; 92 ng/g dw) and Î£NBFRs ranged ND-37 000 ng/g dw (median 2.0 ng/g dw). Concentrations in soils were found to be significantly negatively associated with distance from one of the e-waste facilities for Î£penta-BDEs, BDE-183, BDE-209, and Î£NBFR compound groups. ANOVA tests further illustrated the potential for e-waste recycling to significantly elevate concentrations of some BFRs in soils over distances up to 900 m compared to references sites. This study provides the first evidence of soil contamination with PBDEs and NBFRs originating from formal e-waste recycling facilities in Australia, which may have implications for e-waste recycling practices throughout the world."
"Being ""Red"" on the internet: The craft of popularity on Chinese social media platforms Karl Marx; Economics; Capitalism While in common English-language parlance speaking of ""online celebrities"" encourages the conflation of new forms of famousness with existing discourses on mass media stardom and fandom, the Mandarin Chinese term wanghong, a shorthand term for wangluo hongren (literally ""person popular on the internet""), frames the enticing shores of online celebrity through the peculiar lexical domain of a grassroots popularity. The figure of the wanghong has in recent years accompanied the development of social media platforms in China, becoming a profitable profession, an inspirational role model, a morally condemnable by-product of internet economies, and in general a widely debated social phenomenon among local users. Drawing on interviews with more and less successful local online celebrities and discussions with their audiences, this chapter offers an up-to-date portrayal of the various forms of wanghong currently vying for attention on Chinese social media platforms, illustrating how popularity is crafted along with narratives of professionalism and economic aspirations intimately connected to the sociotechnical contexts of contemporary China."
"Regulatory mapping for future fuels Australia's gas infrastructure is subject to a range of regulations that are all designed for facilities that use natural gas. With the advent of future fuels, this infrastructure will be used with other fuels and so various regulatory changes will be required in order to ensure that future fuels can be used appropriately, and regulation remains consistent with public policy objectives, in particular the National H2 Strategy and the work recently completed by the COAG kickstart project investigating the technical and regu latory barriers for a 10% blend of hydrogen in the natural gas distribution network."

"Are Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers Associated with Reductions in Poverty and Improvements in Well-being? Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations Should Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) be the tool for implementing the new Sustainable Development Goals, as they were for the Millennium Development Goals? Surprisingly, despite the controversies around them, there has never been a quantitative evaluation of PRSPs. This paper estimates the impact of having a PRSP on various targets of the Millennium Development Goals. Results suggest that countries under PRSP treatment achieve much greater reductions than control countries, in head count poverty and infant mortality, while also achieving greater improvements in primary school enrolments and gender parity."

"Human rights from a social accounting perspective in a post-conflict environment: The case of Sri Lanka Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative This paper examines how three decades of civil conflict in Sri Lanka has impacted the perceptions of the accounting practitioners with regard to human rights (both during and post-conflict). Using the legitimacy lens in social accounting and the role of the state-supported accountancy body-Institute of Chartered Accountants Sr Lanka (CASL) human rights case is investigated. Specifically, the studyâ€™s scope is on rights and the degree of legitimacy formation for which accounting associations are accountable for human rights disclosure in a post-conflict environment in an emerging economy. The study interprets documentary evidence and a survey data that was administered among the members of the CASL. The findings reveal that the civil conflict had not hindered the accountants being in parallel with the legitimacy of social accounting notions adopted by the Western world in the disclosure of human rights. At the individual response level, they perceive that the accounting discipline as agents to promote human rights disclosure in business entities. Despite the fact, that this study has a low response rate, what is generalisable is an understanding of the processes and mechanisms which relate to the way the accountants perceived human rights by themselves. The practical implication indicates that urgent measures need to be undertaken to mainstream the legitimate human rights obligations of business entities since there is no one-size-fits-all strategy in a post-conflict environment. The social implication is that awareness of human rights issues, especially among the next generation of accountants is vital since this transformation would enable them not only to be technically competent but also to be ethical in a post-conflict environment. The study contributes to the literature on perceptions of human rights in a post-conflict environment from a social accounting perspective in an emerging economy."

"On the regulation of the intersection between religion and the provision of financial services: Conversations with market actors within the global Islamic financial services sector Islamic Banking; Islamic Financial Institutions; Malaysia Islamic finance finds itself in a unique position given its robust performance over the recent financial crisis suggesting its resilience as a financial system to exogenous shocks. Existing studies attribute this strong performance to its institutional and systemic regulatory framework, however, much of the extant literature is descriptive and lacks a holistic consideration for Islamic financial regulation. Our study differs from the extant literature by approaching this area of study as a nexus of institutional and systemic regulatory factors thus providing a richer view of Islamic financial regulation. We generate this richer understanding through discourse with market actors on these stylized debates thus allowing us to gain further insight to delineate and disentangle key concepts thus providing a more integrated framework of Islamic financial regulation. Our findings extend the academic literature in indicating that issues of institutional governance are nested within broader systemic regulation, that the need for regulatory harmonization persists, and that there are continual calls for the creation of a central monetary authority for the global Islamic financial sector. Our results enhance the extent of understanding of the focuses on developing sustainable regulation within the Islamic financial system."

"Carbon sequestration value of biosolids applied to soil: A global meta-analysis Soil Organic Carbon; China; Carbon Sinks Biosolids produced at wastewater treatment facilities are extensively used in agricultural land and degraded mine sites to improve soil health and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Many studies have reported increases in SOC due to application of biosolids to such sites. However, lack of a comprehensive quantification on overall trends and changes of magnitude in SOC remains. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to identify drivers with a relationship with SOC stocks. A meta-regression of 297 treatments found four variables with a relationship with SOC stocks: cumulative biosolids carbon (C) input rate, time after application, soil depth and type of biosolids. The cumulative biosolids C input rate was the most influencing driver. The highest mean difference for SOC% of 3.3 was observed at 0â€“15 cm soil depth for a cumulative C input of 100 Mg haâˆ’1 at one year after biosolids application. Although years after biosolids application demonstrated a negative relationship with SOC stocks, mineralization of C in biosolids-applied soils is slow, as indicated with the SOC% decrease from 4.6 to 2.8 at 0â€“15 cm soil depth over five years of 100 Mg haâˆ’1 biosolids C input. Soil depth illustrated a strong negative effect with SOC stocks decreasing by 2.7% at 0â€“15 cm soil depth at a cumulative biosolids C input of 100 Mg haâˆ’1 over a year. Overall, our model estimated an effect of 2.8 SOC% change, indicating the application of biosolids as a viable strategy for soil C sequestration on a global scale."
"Bioaugmentation of seafood processing wastewater enhances the removal of inorganic nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand Activated Sludge; Batch Reactors; Salinity Global fish consumption is expected to reach 194 million tonnes by 2026 (FAO, 2017). As a result, careful consideration must be given to the environmental impacts of aquaculture expansion, including potential pollution of receiving waters with effluent from the growth and processing of fish products. The main aim of this study was to improve fish processing wastewater treatment by reducing the dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration and chemical oxygen demand using bioaugmentation, through the application of newly isolated halotolerant, protease-producing bacteria. Five halotolerant bacteria strains were isolated and identified as Marinirhabdus sp., Vibrio sp., Alteromonas sp., Alteromonas macleodii, and Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus based on 16S rRNA sequence phylogenetic analysis. Marinirhabdus sp. and Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus showed significantly higher efficiencies of COD and nitrate, nitrite and ammonium removal compared with the non-bioaugmented control. The COD and nitrogen concentration in fish wastewater treated with Marinirhabdus sp. and Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus were 93 mg Lâˆ’1, 95 mg Lâˆ’1, and 66.7 mg Lâˆ’1, 53.3 mg Lâˆ’1, respectively, with a decrease in total nitrogen synchronous with the degradation of nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium. This work demonstrated that wastewater bioaugmentation represents an effective treatment for saline, fish processing wastewater, and could be used as a robust method for the removal of organic matter and nitrogen in saline fish wastewater."

"Generation of NiTi nanoparticles via high voltage spark discharge in inert gas Electric Sparks; Aerosols; Nanocrystal Spark discharge method in inert gas, due to simplicity, no need for complex equipment and raw materials, ability to produce high-purity nanoparticles and mix metallic nanoparticles, is considered a susceptible method for the synthesis of nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. This method is capable to produce nanoparticles of electrical conductor materials and semiconductors. Also, with small changes in spark discharge system, this method can be capable to deposit thin layers of nanoparticles. Now, this method has been used for producing carbon, metal, alloy and metal oxide nanoparticles. Primary objective of this study was to construct a high voltage electrical discharge system. Next step was the synthesis of NiTi alloy nanoparticles in argon atmosphere, using the same Ni-50at%Ti alloy as electrodes. Characterization of NiTi nanoparticles by FESEM, EDX, DLS and HRTEM helps to determine the NiTi nanoparticles size distribution, morphology and composition. The results demonstrated primary nanoparticles ranging from 10 nm to 20 nm in size with a composition close to that of the electrodes."

"An application of the dual identity model and active categorization to increase intercultural closeness Team Diversity; Personnel; Task Conflict The enhancement of social inclusion is a key to maintaining cohesion in society and to foster the benefits of cultural diversity. Using insights from the Dual Identity Model (DIM) with a special focus on active categorization, we develop an intervention to increase social inclusion. Our intervention encourages the participants to (re-)categorize on a superordinate level (i.e., a human identity) while being exposed to their own culture. Across a set of experiments, we test the efficacy of our intervention against control conditions on the effect of social inclusion, measured by perceived social distance. Results show an increase in cultural closeness and provide preliminary support for the use of a DIM-based intervention to increase intercultural inclusion"

"Colour, culture and difference in Australian teacher education: voices from the edge Critical Race Theory; Testimonio; Education Purpose: Although much has been written about international students in higher education in Australia, there is a paucity of research and discussion about international academics especially non-whites and their lived experience in the workplace. This paper represents the voices of two academics working in metropolitan universities in Melbourne. The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness of how in spite of all the goodwill and highbrow research, the â€œcorridors of academiaâ€ need to be examined in considering the politics of inclusion and internationalisation as the authors still need to address issues of colour as they exist in the academy. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use narrative inquiry and reflection to tell the story as both phenomenon and method where the phenomenon is the story and inquiry is the narrative. Findings: The findings suggest student and staff perceptions of difference are mostly theorised but not practiced within the academy. Research limitations/implications: The paper includes two voices, a limitation in itself, thus generalisations cannot be made to other academics or institutions. The authors recommend more professional development for staff and students alike to embrace issues of colour, culture and difference. Practical implications: The authors draw attention to the need for academics to reflect on their behaviour within their own academic communities and be more aware of minority groups in academia. Social implications: By including and listening to issues facing minority groups (academics and students) can only improve the social cohesion of university worksites. Originality/value: This is an original work carried out by both authors. It raises concerns that may also be experienced international staff and or students."

"Austropuccinia psidii on the move: survey based insights to its geographical distribution, host species, impacts and management in Australia Puccinia Psidii; Myrtus; Rust Disease Austropuccinia psidii is a plant fungus native to South and Central America which causes myrtle rust disease, affecting the growth and reproduction of species in the Myrtaceae family. Austropuccinia psidii was first detected in Australia 8 years ago in New South Wales. Since then it has spread rapidly along the east coast, and to date is known to infect more than 375 native Myrtaceae species in Australia. Despite this, its rapid spread is not well documented and the potential threat to additional Myrtaceae species remains unknown, with no systematic surveillance or monitoring program in Australia. In order to better understand the extent of A. psidii geographic distribution and impacts on Australian landscapes, a survey was sent to national park, botanical garden, local council, nursery and forestry agency employees in all states and territories where the disease is known to be present. More than 500 surveys were sent, and 254 responses were received. The survey confirms that A. psidii is widespread in New South Wales and Queensland urban environments as well as in native vegetation communities. Four new host species were confirmed, as well as four new local government areas in two different states reporting A. psidii infection. The disease severity was classified as medium to high for most host species, with especially negative impacts for Rhodamnia rubescens and Rhodomyrtus psidioides. These survey results provide up-to-date information on the geographical distribution, host species and impacts of A. psidii, which will assist in making management decisions relating to this pathogen across Australia."

"Police prosecution and access to justice for people with disabilities Decision Making; Disability Committee; UN Convention This chapter evaluates the access to justice debates concerning people with disabilities in the criminal justice system from the perspective of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (â€œCRPDâ€). It focuses the human rights issues associated with the prosecution of people with cognitive impairment involved with low-level offences. The chapter argues that the hidden nature of disability limits the efficacy of current prosecution arrangements, pointing to the CRPD as a way forward. It examines the prosecutorial discretion of police in Victoria, Australia. In Victoria, the decision to prosecution low-level offences rests with the police. The prosecutorial arrangements for people with cognitive impairment who commit low-level offences vary across Australian jurisdictions. The disincentive to identify cognitive impairment is amplified by the â€œhiddenâ€ nature of disability. Cognitive impairment is commonly undetected, confused with personality traits or interpreted as mental illness or aggression."

"Recycling industrial slags in production of fired clay bricks for sustainable manufacturing Clay Brick; Brick; Husk Ash Due to the production of industrial slags in massive amounts, there is a high demand for recycling these slags and avoiding their dumping in landfills. This article aims to recycle industrial slags in brick manufacturing and investigates the performance of fired clay bricks incorporating different kinds of industrial slags such as granulated blast furnace slag (GBS), ferrochromium slag (FCS), and steel slag (STS). For this purpose, two different dosages of slags (i.e., 10 and 20 wt % of clay) and two different firing temperatures (i.e., 1000 and 1100 oC) were considered. Various physical, mechanical, and durability tests were performed to evaluate the properties of bricks incorporating industrial slags. Results show that the compressive strength of the bricks incorporating industrial slags are well above the minimum compressive strength limits of bricks as per different building standards. The bricks incorporating industrial slag can be classified as load-bearing bricks for structural applications in accordance with the ASTM C469 standard. An increase in the porosity of bricks is observed with the addition of STS. However, reduced porosity is observed for bricks incorporating FCS and GBS than traditional bricks. Based on the water absorption and efflorescence test results, bricks incorporating industrial slags can be used as severe weather resistant bricks following ASTM C62 standard and slight efflorescence bricks per ASTM C67 standard. The amounts of heavy metals in the leachates of bricks are observed below the specified limits of the Environment Protection Authority. SEM images and EDS analysis of bricks are also supporting the results of this study. Based on the results, utilizing industrial slags in brick manufacturing can help recycle the abundant industrial wastes and develop the fired clay bricks with desired properties."

"Wage theft, underpayment and unpaid work in marketised social care Personnel; Enterprise Bargaining; Employer Association Marketised models of social care provision in Australia are placing pressures on service providers and driving changes in work organisation and employer practices, with potential to degrade social care jobs. While international experience of marketised social care has demonstrated the vulnerability of social care workers to wage theft and other violations of employment laws, Australiaâ€™s relatively strong industrial relations safety net might be expected to be better able to protect these low-paid workers. Nevertheless, there is emerging evidence of negative impacts on the pay and entitlements of frontline workers in the expanding community support and homecare workforce. This study investigates the paid and unpaid work time of disability support workers under Australiaâ€™s new National Disability Insurance Scheme. The research takes a novel approach combining analysis of working day diaries and qualitative interviews with employees to expose how jobs are being fragmented and work is being organised into periods of paid and unpaid time, leaving employees paid below their minimum entitlement. The article highlights the role of social care policy along with inadequate employment regulation. JEL Codes: J390, J81, J88."

"Initial sizing methodology for hybrid-electric general aviation aircraft Helicopter; Air Mobility; Propellers Electric and hybrid-electric propulsion offer unique possibilities to improve aircraft efficiency and performance. The potential advantages are fuel savings, lower emissions, and reduced noise. Because hybrid-electric aircraft generally apply multiple power sources, they can be designed to sustain flight if certain parts of the propulsion system fail. However, their additional degrees of freedom increase the complexity of the design process. This paper describes a methodology of an initial sizing algorithm that considers aircraft with hybrid-electric propulsion systems. A central element is a modified constraint diagram, which matches the power-to-weight ratio, wing loading, and the hybridization of power HP . It is coupled with a mission performance analysis that is capable of dealing with multiple energy sources and defines the mass and size of all relevant aircraft components. The modified constraint diagram also allows a visual assessment of the sizing results, and thereby greater insight into the design space."
"Determining the potential role of the waste sector in decoupling of phosphorus: A comprehensive review of national scale substance flow analyses Struvite; Waste Water; Phosphorus This study, the first of its kind, presents a comprehensive assessment of national scale phosphorus (P) flow in the waste sector with particular focus on P recovery. The largest inflow of P in waste stream is seen in China (8124 kt), with the next largest inflow, the USA, being significantly less at 431 kt. Countries through east Asia and western Europe tend to show moderate inflows, e.g. Japan (131.66 kt), France (115.70 kt), UK (76 kt) and South Korea (65.40 kt), while northern European nations have low P inflows, Denmark (10 kt), Sweden (10 kt) and Norway (6.70 kt). The most efficient recovery rate of P from the waste sector is seen to be in Finland (67.50%). Denmark (53.70%), France (47.80%) and UK (47.40%), all have commendable recovery tracks. Even though USA has the second largest inflow of P, their recovery track is one of the lowest (2 kt), making its recycling efficiency minute (0.50%), while with a recovery of 3148 kt P, this is 39% for China. This study has also calculated the substitutability of each country's recycled P waste in minimizing extraction of virgin P resource/importing P, as found to be the highest in China (49.40). The UK and Sweden have the second and third highest substitutability of 26.10 and 19.80 respectively, while the Netherlands (1.40) and USA (0.05) have the lowest. This study can be used as a guideline for future research on P recovery from waste because it provides a comprehensive blueprint of P flow in this sector and prescribes a general framework for better recovery."

"Resetting the Compass: Principles for Responsible Urban Built Environment Education (PRUE) Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Several international frameworks supporting sustainable development have come into existence since the Rio Conference in 1992. While recent frameworks developed have included education as a key component of sustainability, these frameworks do not offer a clear direction for university educators to embrace sustainability in their curriculum, and wider engagement with co academic and non academic colleagues, student, campus and wider community to work collaboratively. The principal aim of the paper is to develop and support a collaborative networked platform for university educators, particularly in the Asia Pacific to support and enhance their capacities to develop and promote sustainability education. Despite a number of international treaties to support and accelerate global trends towards sustainable development, we are still a long way from living in a low carbon world. Secondary literature review is undertaken to understand the gaps in current treaties to support a way forward to move towards sustainable futures from an educational perspective. The literature demonstrates there are gaps between intent and action. However, there is a long road to be traversed to translate ideas into reality and even more to mainstream industry knowledge, curricula and capacities to support sustainability outcomes in the built environment. There is still a gap between action and intent with regard to achieving sustainability outcomes in the built environment. These gaps are in real danger of becoming even more wider and deeper, and more urgent and critical as we fail to meet our international targets with regard to low carbon futures. PRME: Principles for Responsible Management Education translated to the built environment as PRUE: Principles for Responsible Urban built environment Education offers an opportunity for supporting sustainability into built environment programs in universities."

"Dynamic Learner-Assisted Interactive Learning Tools for Power Systems Engineering Courses Moodle; Learning Management System; Dashboards Contribution: Interactive learning tools with multiple learning support functionalities are nonexistent in power engineering education. An interactive learning tool for supporting student learning in power engineering is shown to improve analytical skills of students. Background: Power network architectures are becoming increasingly complex, requiring the development of educational tools to familiarize students with challenging engineering problems associated with these emerging architectures. Interactive functionalities offered by existing learning tools are inadequate to achieve the learning objectives of the evolving power engineering curriculum. Intended Outcomes: It is expected to improve students' conceptual understanding and analytical skill base by recognizing the correct base-values and actual ratings of power system devices in per-unit calculations, hence students will able to score high marks in exams. Application Design: It is essential to assess the knowledge level of the student for creating effective learning exercises. The proposed interactive learning tools first assess the student's knowledge level, then based on the results create a specific exercise giving a network model, and a unique set of parameters. The tools include solving assistance with three support-levels; in each level more information is provided to assist with solution process enabling students to recognize specific mistakes in their calculations. Once a given exercise is successfully completed, the student is prompted to undertake more challenging exercises, which will assist their progressive cognitive development. Findings: The average mark for the per-unit calculation question in the MST was improved by approx 40 % after implementing the proposed learning tool, demonstrating its effectiveness."

"Role of financial mechanisms for accelerating the rate of water and energy efficiency retrofits in Australian public buildings: Hybrid Bayesian Network and System Dynamics modelling approach Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation In Australia, the government spending on public buildingsâ€™ energy and water consumption is considerable; however the building energy and water retrofit market potential has been diminished by a number of barriers, especially financial. In contrast, in other advanced economies there are several reported financing strategies that have been shown to accelerate retrofit projects implementation. In this study, a coupled Bayesian Network â€“ System Dynamics model was developed with the core aim to assess the likely influence of those novel financing options and procurement procedures on public building retrofit outcomes scenarios in the Australian context. A particular case-study focusing on Australian public hospitals was showcased as an example in this paper. Stakeholder engagement was utilised to estimate likely preferences and to conceptualise causal relationships of model parameters. The scenario modelling showed that a revolving loan fund supporting an energy performance contracting procurement procedure was preferred. Subsequently, the specific features of this preferred framework were optimised to yield the greatest number of viable retrofit projects over the long term. The results indicated that such a financing scheme would lead to substantial abatement of energy and water consumption, as well as carbon emissions. The strategic scenario analysis approach developed herein provides evidence-based support to policy-makers advocating novel financing and procurement models for addressing a government's sustainability agenda in a financially responsible and net-positive manner."

"A short work-flow to effectively source faecal pollution in recreational waters – A case study Bacteroidales; Seashore; Fecal Bacterium Microbial pollution of recreational waters poses a significant public health risk which, unless mitigated, will continue to increase with population growth. Water managers must implement strategies to accurately discriminate and source human from animal faecal contamination in complex urbanised environments. Our case-study used a new combination of chemical (i.e. ammonia) and microbial (i.e. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides spp.) faecal monitoring tools in a targeted multi-tiered approach to quickly identify pollution hot-spots and track high-risk subterranean stormwater drains in real-time. We successfully located three point sources of human faecal pollution (both episodic and constant pollution streams) within 11 catchments in a total monitoring time of four months. Alternative approaches for obtaining such fine-scale accuracy are typically labour intensive and require expensive equipment."

"Quantification of seasonal photo-induced formation of reactive intermediates in a municipal sewage lagoon upon sunlight exposure Dissolved Organic Matter; Photodegradation; Water Photochemically produced reactive oxygen species in wastewater lagoons upon sunlight exposure are important in the attenuation of emerging contaminants (ECs). The production of reactive radicals in wastewater lagoons depends on both environmental factors and the composition of effluent organic matter (EfOM) in the wastewater. Knowing the steady state concentrations of these reactive species produced in a particular lagoon wastewater is critical to the prediction of the persistence and attenuation of ECs in that sunlit wastewater treatment lagoon. This study quantified the formation of four photochemically produced reactive intermediates (PPRIs): hydroxyl radical, carbonate radical, singlet oxygen, and triplet excited state EfOM in 11 samples collected from a municipal wastewater lagoon over a full year. The temporal distribution of these key PPRIs in the lagoon under investigation was determined in relation to sunlight irradiance, wastewater composition and temperature. Greater sunlight intensity led to greater PPRI production over the year. Increasing wastewater temperature from 12 to 25 Â°C led to greater production of singlet oxygen, a moderate decrease in hydroxyl radical and increase in triplet excited state EfOM, and minimal impact on carbonate radical production. The optical properties of the lagoon wastewater of Napierian absorption coefficient (A300) and E2:E3 ratio could be used as indicators of the formation of singlet oxygen (Pearson's r = 0.79) and triplet excited EfOM (Pearson's r = 0.76) produced upon solar irradiation. The concentration of carbonate radical formed was strongly correlated to the nitrate level in the wastewater (Pearson's r = 0.85). The findings could be used for modelling the seasonal sunlight-induced photolysis process of ECs during lagoon-based wastewater treatment, with a view to optimising the treatment process, predicting the efficacy of EC removal, and risk assessment of the treated water."

"Deciding to invest responsibly: Choice architecture and demographics in an incentivised retirement savings experiment Nudges; Behavioral Economics; Paternalism We report results from a framed field experiment with a realistic retirement savings simulation to examine two factors in socially responsible investment (SRI) decisions: characteristics of investors and the investment choice architecture. We find that default options, age and values are significant explanators while infographics, gender, education and income are not. Further, repeated decisions affect SRI negatively through donor fatigue and positively through windfall gains. Our results suggest SRI is significantly limited by the non-ethical default options pension providers commonly set. Conversely there is scope for nudging pension savers towards socially responsible investments using defaults."

"Environmental isotopes as indicators of groundwater recharge, residence times and salinity in a coastal urban redevelopment precinct in Australia Landfill Leachates; Leaching; Municipal Solid Waste Fishermans Bend is an urban redevelopment precinct situated on the Yarra River estuary in Melbourne, Australia. Understanding the hydrogeological system is important for characterising the impacts from legacy contamination and for monitoring the effects of urbanisation on groundwater flow systems and quality. Stable isotopes of water (Î´18O, Î´2H) and carbon (Î´13C), radioisotopes (3H, 14C) and other geochemical indicators were used to assess sources of water and salinity in the shallow groundwater. Groundwater in the upper aquifer was predominantly Ca-HCO3 âˆ’ dominant, with fresh to brackish salinityâ€”189â€“3,680 mg/L total dissolved solids (TDS). Localised areas of Ca-SO4 2âˆ’ and Na-HCO3 âˆ’ dominant groundwater were impacted by industrial activities and legacy landfills, respectively. Stable isotopes (e.g. Î´18O âˆ’5.7 to âˆ’2.9â€°) and tritium activities (1.75â€“2.45 TU) within the aquifer indicate meteoric water recharged by modern rainfall with short residence times. Carbonate dissolution from shell material, and decay of organic waste and methanogenesis in landfill-leachate-impacted bores were shown to enrich Î´13C values up to âˆ’4.2â€°. In contrast, groundwater in the adjacent/lower aquitard was Na-Cl dominant and saline (19,600â€“23,900 mg/L TDS), with molar ratios reflective of ocean water, indicating relict emplaced salts. This is consistent with 14C dating of shell material, indicating deposition in a Holocene marine environment. The presence of tritium above background levels (0.20â€“0.35 TU) in the groundwater, however, suggests a component of modern recharge. Salinity fluctuations within the aquitard at times of peak river level suggest the modern water source is ingress from the adjacent Yarra River."

"Environmental factors affecting the germination and seedling emergence of two populations of an emerging agricultural weed: Wild lettuce (Lactuca serriola) Seed; Germination; Weeds Wild lettuce (Lactuca serriola L.) is a significant emerging agricultural and environmental weed in many countries. This invasive species is now naturalised in Australia and is claimed to cause significant losses within the agricultural industry. Sustainable management of wild lettuce has been hampered by a lack of detailed knowledge of its seed ecology. Laboratory-based studies were performed to examine the potential influence of environmental factors including temperature and light conditions, salinity, pH, moisture availability and burial depth on the germination and emergence of two spatially distant populations of wild lettuce. Results suggested that the germination of wild lettuce seeds occurred across a broad range of temperature conditions (12-h cycle: 30Â°C/20Â°C, 25Â°C/15Â°C and 17Â°C/7Â°C) for both populations. We also found that these seeds are non-photoblastic germination was not affected by darkness, with >80% germination in darkness for both populations at all tested temperature ranges. Germination significantly declined as salinity and osmotic stress increased for both populations, with seeds from the Tempy population were more affected by NaCl >100 mM than seeds from Werribee, but in neither population was there any observed effect of pH on germination (>80% germination in both populations at all tested pH ranges). For both populations, germination significantly decreased as burial depth increased however, the two populations differed with regard to response to burial depth treatment, whereby seeds from the Tempy population had higher emergence than those from Werribee at 0.5 cm burial depth. These results suggest that light-reducing management techniques such as mulching or use of crop residues will be unsuccessful for preventing germination of wild lettuce. By contrast, burial of seeds at a depth of at least 4 cm will significantly reduce their emergence."
"An experimental study to establish a salt gradient solar pond (SGSP) Solar Ponds; Salinity; Exergy This paper describes the experimental method to establish a salinity gradient in a MgCl2 solar pond (SGSP) at Bundoora East campus of Royal Melbourne Information of Technology (RMIT) University, Melbourne, Australia. The pond was instructed in 2001, with a 15 m2 surface area. This experiment involves using saturated brine to establish the lower thermal storage (or convective) zone (LCZ) as well as the middle insulating layer in which the salinity decreases with height. This non-convective zone (NCZ) is proctored from mixings caused by the wind and the destabilizing effects of diurnal variation of the ambient temperature by an upper convicting layer (UCZ). In this top layer (UCZ) both the temperature and salinity are uniform. These properties increase with depth in the (NCZ). Density and temperature usually assume their maximum values at the interface between the NCZ and the lower convective zone (LCZ). Both these properties y are usually constant in the (LCZ).In order to set up the salinity gradient using an injection filling technic introduced by Zangrando technique (1980). In this method, the pond is first filled to half the depth of the planned gradient zone with highly concentrated salt water. Next, fresh water, or salt water of a low concentration, is injected horizontally into the brine through a diffuser. The novelty for this paper is investigation redistribution method experimentally using simple technic to find the required volume of injected fresh water."

"Similarities in metabolic flexibility and hunger hormone ghrelin exist between FTO gene variants in response to an acute dietary challenge Melanocortin 4 Receptor; Body Mass; Adiposity The rs9939609 polymorphism of the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene has been associated with obesity, and studies have also shown that environmental/lifestyle interaction such as dietary intake might mediate this effect. The current study investigates the postprandial hormonal regulators of hunger and indirect markers of substrate utilisation and metabolic flexibility following a dietary challenge to determine if suppression of circulating ghrelin levels and/or reduced metabolic flexibility exist between FTO genotypes. One hundred and forty seven healthy, sedentary males and females (29.0 Â± 0.7 yrs; 70.2 Â± 1.1 kg; 169.1 Â± 0.8 cm; 24.5 Â± 0.3 kg/m2) complete a single experimental session. Anthropometric measures, circulating levels of active ghrelin, insulin and glucose, and substrate oxidation via indirect calorimetry, are measured pre-prandial and/or post-prandial. The FTO rs9939609 variant is genotyped using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolic flexibility (âˆ†RER) is similar between FTO genotypes of the rs9939609 (T > A) polymorphism (p > 0.05). No differences in pre-prandial and/or postprandial substrate oxidation, plasma glucose, serum insulin or ghrelin are observed between genotypes (p > 0.05). These observations are independent of body mass index and gender. Altered postprandial responses in hunger hormones and metabolic flexibility may not be a mechanism by which FTO is associated with higher BMI and obesity in healthy, normal-weighted individuals."
"Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design Urban Biodiversity; Urbanization; Birds Cities are increasingly considered important places for biodiversity conservation because they can harbor threatened species and because conservation in cities represents an opportunity to reconnect people with nature and the range of health and well-being benefits it provides. However, urbanization can be catastrophic for native species, and is a well-known threat to biodiversity worldwide. Urbanization impacts can be mitigated by urban design and development improvements, but take-up of these practices has been slow. There is an urgent need to incorporate existing ecological knowledge into a framework that can be used by planners and developers to ensure that biodiversity conservation is considered in decision-making processes. Here, we distill the urban biodiversity literature into five principles for biodiversity sensitive urban design (BSUD), ranging from creating habitat and promoting dispersal to facilitating community stewardship. We then present a framework for implementing BSUD aimed at delivering onsite benefits to biodiversity, and that is applicable across a range of urban development types and densities. We illustrate the application of the BSUD framework in two case studies focusing on the: (1) protection of an endangered vegetation remnant in a new low-density subdivision; and (2) persistence of an endangered reptile in an established suburban environment."

The project will run for 12 months and include animal studies. Part of the animal studies will be subcontracted to Scolexia (to be finalised and contracted) Ridley applied for a voucher under the DEDJTR Boost your Business Program Food Innovation Vouchers stream with assistance from RMIT. RMIT provided a quote for a work specification which has been accepted. (see attached letter) Under the voucher program, the industry partner is able to obtain funding support from the state govt of 50% of project value up to a maximum of 50k. Given the project value of 80613, that means the company is funding 40307 and the government 40306. The mechanism used for these projects is to bill the company up front for their contribution. At the end of the project, the parties complete a voucher and send certain supporting material to the government and RMIT then bills the government for the balance. There is no formal grant agreement between RMIT and DEDJTR. This mechanism is familiar to RMIT and has existed in the past, the current round is a new manifestation of the same programs (albeit with a higher co-contribution required from the company).

"Energy and Materials Recovery from Paunch Waste Using Novel Hydrothermal and Supercritical Water Gasification Processes - Phase 1 This multiphase project aims to investigate the feasibility of Hydrothermal Carbonisation and Supercritical Water Gasification processes for processing heavily moisture-laden paunch waste.  Paunch waste needs exhaustive pre-treatments before its thermochemical transformation to produce char and gas in a conventional pyrolyser or gasifier system. The processes proposed here completely eliminate this water removal step and generate value-added products such as hydro- or super- char (i.e. char produced from hydrothermal and supercritical conditions) and a high quality syngas enriched in hydrogen. The thermal and solids conversion
efficiencies with these advanced processes can be as high as 90-95%. The superior forms of char obtained can be functionalised for their applications in soil amendment, as adsorbent in waste water treatment or for advanced energy generation. If successful, it will resolve a number of ongoing and future socio-economic and environmental issues associated with waste disposal/treatment in Australian abattoirs.

"Recent advances of Li7La3Zr2O12-based solid-state lithium batteries towards high energy density Electrode; Solid Electrolytes; Garnets To satisfy the demand for high energy density and high safety lithium batteries, garnet-based all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are the research hot spots in recent decades. Within the garnet family, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a promising candidate for solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) that has been extensively investigated due to the high ionic conductivity, chemical stability, electrochemical stability, air stability, thermal stability and safety. Recently, several laboratory-scale works on LLZO-based ASSLBs are achieved. However, although LLZO-based SSEs have made tremendous advancements today, there are still several critical issues in the practical application of ASSLBs with high energy density and low cost. Herein, optimization of LLZO structure, preparation of high-quality LLZO-based SSEs, engineering of the interface between LLZO-based SSEs and realization of LLZO-based ASSLBs with high energy density are systematically analyzed, discussed, and summarized to offer a clearer comprehension of the crucial challenges and future research orientations. It is expected to not only enhance the knowledge of audiences in this field but also facilitate the achievement of practical commercial applications in LLZO-based ASSLBs."

"An ecosystem service perspective on urban nature, physical activity, and health Greenspace; Green Infrastructure; National Parks Nature underpins human well-being in critical ways, especially in health. Nature provides pollination of nutritious crops, purification of drinking water, protection from floods, and climate security, among other well-studied health benefits. A crucial, yet challenging, research frontier is clarifying how nature promotes physical activity for its many mental and physical health benefits, particularly in densely populated cities with scarce and dwindling access to nature. Here we frame this frontier by conceptually developing a spatial decision-support tool that shows where, how, and for whom urban nature promotes physical activity, to inform urban greening efforts and broader health assessments. We synthesize what is known, present a model framework, and detail the model steps and data needs that can yield generalizable spatial models and an effective tool for assessing the urban nature-physical activity relationship. Current knowledge supports an initial model that can distinguish broad trends and enrich urban planning, spatial policy, and public health decisions. New, iterative research and application will reveal the importance of different types of urban nature, the different subpopulations who will benefit from it, and nature's potential contribution to creating more equitable, green, livable cities with active inhabitants."

"Opportunities for using blockchain in distributed solar energy projects Hot Temperature; Phase Change Materials; Photovoltaic System The involvement of many stakeholders from diverse sectors throughout the distributed solar energy (DSE) project lifecycle and their discrete commitments to the project have lessened the stakeholder understanding in each other's contribution. Communication between the stakeholders is not continuous and systematic; thus, the project information is not well-communicated for accurate decision making. Therefore, DSE projects have not yet won the complete stakeholder trust and its adoption in the building industry is not yet fully accepted. This study aims at exploring the opportunities for using blockchain technology to reduce/eliminate the trust issues and communication gaps along the DSE lifecycle. The study conducts 50 semi-structured interviews with building and energy stakeholders to identify the issues/ limitations which (1) reduce the stakeholder trust on DSE technologies and applications and (2) generate communication gaps along the DSE project lifecycle. Findings reveal that most of the issues/ limitations occurred due to the unavailability of a common platform for communication and information sharing, unavailability of information, improper record keeping and limited information security. The unique features of blockchain technology such as (1) distributed ledger technology (DLT), (2) smart contracts, (3) token-based access control, and (4) automated consensus and forking can effectively eliminate the identified issues/ limitations by providing (1) information accuracy and reliability, (2) information security, (3) open access to project information, (4) systematic record keeping and (5) proper governance of the system. The outcome of this study provides a systematic approach to increase the quality of communication in DSE projects design and management."

"Intellectual capital efficiency and organisational performance: In the context of the pharmaceutical industry in Bangladesh Intellectual Capital; Value-Added Intellectual Coefficient; Intangible Assets Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to, the first of its kind, investigate the relationship between the intellectual capital efficiency and organisational performance of the pharmaceutical sector in Bangladesh, an emerging economy that enjoys Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) relaxation. Design/methodology/approach: The study used hand-picked data from annual reports for five years. The relationship between efficient use of intellectual capital and corporate performance was examined through the practical use of human capital, structural capital and capital employed. Multiple regressions were used to assess their impact on financial performance â€“ specifically, return on assets, return on equity, asset turnover and market-to-book value. Findings: Value-added intellectual coefficient components (i.e. human capital, structural capital and capital employed) significantly explained asset turnover and return on assets but failed to predict the return on equity outcome. Additionally, asset turnover was negatively influenced by structural capital and positively influenced by capital employed. The return on assets was mostly affected by variation in human capital. Intellectual capital did not predict market-to-book value or investment decisions. Practical implications: This paper provides useful resources for evaluating the financial performance and value creation of companies in emerging economies that enjoy TRIPS exemptions; this research could also be extended using cross-industry comparisons. The findings have theoretical and practical implications, particularly for the pharmaceutical industry in emerging economy contexts, and for managers globally. Originality/value: This study is among only a few that have reported on the relationship between intellectual capital efficiency and value creation in emerging economy contexts."

This paper introduces a life cycle costing tool, incorporating both an Environmental LCC and Societal LCC to provide decision support to local government. The tool was tested on two case study waste catchments; comparing seven unique food waste management systems. Results indicated that food waste anaerobic digestion or co-digestion, shown to have smaller environmental impacts, can be implemented with marginal increase (1.7% to 11.6%) in overall cost. Moreover, with efficiencies food waste anaerobic digestion systems can demonstrate the same cost as business-as-usual. Composting systems were also revealed to have consistently lower costs per household across case studies than business-as-usual, although environmental impacts were generally higher than digestion systems. Further analysis determined the required rate of policy incentives (i.e. landfill levy, electricity tariffs and carbon credits) to promote various alternative food waste management systems."
"Using measures of efficiency for regionally-targeted smallholder policy intervention: The case of Pakistan's horticulture sector Agriculture; Stochastic Frontier Model; Metafrontier The empirical literature on the sources of production efficiency mostly focuses on technical and scale efficiency, and the relative importance of mix efficiency is often overlooked. This paper estimates input-oriented technical and mix efficiency using a farm-level survey dataset of 730 smallholder horticulture farms in Pakistan. We estimate a Bayesian stochastic production frontier model to draw precise statistical inferences by using finite sample properties. We find that the estimated mean mix inefficiency (0.65) is roughly as large as mean technical inefficiency (0.64). Moreover, we detect large technical and mix efficiency disparities across agro-climatic zones and farm sizes, which we attribute to suboptimal farm practices. We conclude that policy-makers should focus on strategies that target to improve both technical and mix inefficiency."
"Impact of Probabilistic Modelling of Wind Speed on Power System Voltage Profile and Voltage Stability Analysis Monte Carlo Method; Point Estimate; Wind Farms Wind speed characteristics may have a significant impact on the power system operation, stability and dynamics. Hence, appropriate modelling and quantification of wind probability distribution function (PDF) are critical for probabilistic power system analysis. Weibull distribution is the most widely used PDF for power system (particularly power system stability) studies, which might not be a valid PDF for different wind regimes having high, average, and low wind speed data. In this study, twenty different wind speed datasets (each dataset is different based on the location, duration, and resolution) have been collected and analysed with eight PDFs to model the wind speed to replicate different wind speed characteristics. The PDFs include Rayleigh, Weibull, Gamma, Lognormal, Normal, Inverse Gaussian, Generalized Extreme Value, and Exponential distributions. Root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) are applied as the measure of accuracy. The obtained results show that the locations, duration, and resolution have a notable impact on the selection of suitable PDFs. It was found that the Gamma distribution is the best-suited PDF for representing low wind speed data. In comparison, the Weibull distribution represents the best PDF for high wind speed data. Also, the selection of the Gamma PDF for low wind speed data and Weibull distribution for high wind speed data is further validated by presenting voltage profile and voltage stability analysis. Study outcomes would assist power system planners to select the appropriate PDF for power system stability studies based on the characteristics of the available wind speed dataset."
"Early Menopause: Implementation Research using the Experiences and Perspectives of Women and Health Professionals to Translate Evidence into Practice (Administered by Monash University; NHMRC) Early menopause (menopause before age 45 years), occurs spontaneously or secondary to medical treatments, especially after cancer diagnosis, and affects more than 10% of women1, 2. Early menopause (EM) is associated with significant morbidity, increased mortality and negative impact on quality of life1. EM stakeholders involved in this partnership recognise both consumer and health professional knowledge gaps regarding EM and the need for evidence based resources around EM. These knowledge gaps contribute to delayed diagnosis, variation in management, dissatisfaction with care, non-compliance with cancer treatment, poor risk perception and poorer outcomes."
"Modelling and simulation of flux prediction and salinity variation in direct contact membrane distillation for seawater desalination and brine treatment Distillation; Direct Contact; Membrane As one of the state-of-art desalination technologies, membrane distillation (MD) has been widely studied in recent years. In order to better control the performance of the MD, a new model that can predict the membrane surface temperatures, permeate flux as well as salinity variation with the operating time has been proposed in this study. Using the model, impacts of operating parameters such as bulk temperature, flow rate, different membrane materials and feed salinity on the permeate flux as well as the efficiency of driving force were simulated. The results of the simulations indicate that feed temperature, feed flow rate and membrane pore size have the most significant influence on the permeate flux. However, the feed and permeate flow rates have the highest impacts on the temperature polarization coefficient (TPC) which has the highest value of 0.68 under certain conditions. Besides, the simulations predicted that the water recovery from the MD for the seawater and the desalination brine at the saturation point of NaCl to be 86.8 % and 72.1 %, respectively. Finally, the salinity variations with operating time were also simulated and the new model would be vital for the salinity control in desalination processes such as membrane distillation crystallization."
"Estimating the effect of park proximity to the central of Melbourne city on Urban Heat Island (UHI) relative to Land Surface Temperature (LST) Heat Islands; Land Surface Temperature; Land Cover Temperature in cities cores has realized always warmer than the surroundings, which is described as Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. Using of vegetation is one of the effective methods to combat this phenomenon. This study used urban parks (27 parks) located on three distance levels from the Melbourne city centre, which were choose by graduated size. Parks were heavily tested eight measuring time per day (six major and two minor) per month. Handheld measurement device used to measure Land Surface Temperature (LST) used to collect data during all transect points, which extended up 0.295â€“3 km beyond each park's perimeter. Study results presented that average maximums Park Cool Island (PCI) between 3 Â°C and 10 Â°C for all rings, however, parks close to the city centre showed higher PCI than the others during the first part of average maximums of Park Cooling Distance (PCD) up to 1100 m. Closest parks to the city (Ring 1) extended PCD to 3000 m, however, the other parks reached farther than 2000 m. Study concluded that all parks provided cooling benefits to the surrounding urban area. Urbanization was strongly effected on cooling magnitude (PCI) in the first cooling distance, which reached to 746 m. In the other words, parks decreased temperature in the built up areas started from the edge of parks to 746 m (Ring 1 > Ring 2 > Ring 3)."
"Hydrogeological drivers and fate of spring flow in a semi-arid setting (administered by Flinders University) In arid and semi-arid climates, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems often rely on groundwater springs. Spring hydrology depends on complex relationships between underlying aquifers and surface conditions, leading to high uncertainties in the understanding aquifer-spring-wetland hydrology, which is critical for spring ecosystem protection and to inform management of relevant groundwater-affecting activities. This project will apply novel hydrogeophysical and hydrochemical methods, and computer modelling, to investigate the source aquifer of, and fate of discharge from, the Doongmabulla Springs Complex (DSC), located in an area of future development.
Project results will inform spring vulnerability to development pressures and climate effects."

"What next? Expanding our view of city planning and global health, and implementing and monitoring evidence-informed policy Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians This Series on urban design, transport, and health aimed to facilitate development of a global system of health-related policy and spatial indicators to assess achievements and deficiencies in urban and transport policies and features. This final paper in the Series summarises key findings, considers what to do next, and outlines urgent key actions. Our study of 25 cities in 19 countries found that, despite many well intentioned policies, few cities had measurable standards and policy targets to achieve healthy and sustainable cities. Available standards and targets were often insufficient to promote health and wellbeing, and health-supportive urban design and transport features were often inadequate or inequitably distributed. City planning decisions affect human and planetary health and amplify city vulnerabilities, as the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted. Hence, we offer an expanded framework of pathways through which city planning affects health, incorporating 11 integrated urban system policies and 11 integrated urban and transport interventions addressing current and emerging issues. Our call to action recommends widespread uptake and further development of our methods and open-source tools to create upstream policy and spatial indicators to benchmark and track progress; unmask spatial inequities; inform interventions and investments; and accelerate transitions to net zero, healthy, and sustainable cities."

"Cohesion: Our environment—building better and smarter Snow Making; Skiing; Skis The world is rapidly changing. Climate change is recognised as one of the greatest challenges facing the world today, and Australia is not an exception (see Chapter â€œ Urban Climates in the Transformation of Australian Cities â€). Environmental degradation is mainly due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. We are already seeing changes to weather patterns and more extreme and frequent weather events. This impacts on our built environment, our cities and our way of life. For example, hotter weather causes rising electricity demand due to increased requirements for cooling in buildings. A changing climate is also creating significant health and well-being challenges, especially during extreme weather events. The built environment is a significant contributor to rising greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing energy demand over recent decades, mostly from fossil fuel, needs to be addressed if the built environment is to transition to a low carbon and sustainable future. This chapter touches on the key themes emerging from the preceding chapters and discusses what they mean for achieving a sustainable built environment, not only in Australia but globally."
"Correlation of regional deposition dosage for inhaled nanoparticles in human and rat olfactory Nasal Cavity; Rhinomanometry; Computational Fluid Dynamics Background: Nose-to-brain transport of airborne ultrafine particles (UFPs) via the olfactory pathway has been verified as a possible route for particle translocation into the brain. The exact relationship between increased airborne toxicant exposure and neurological deterioration in the human central nervous system, is still unclear. However, the nasal olfactory is undoubtedly a critical junction where the time course and toxicant dose dependency might be inferred. Method: Computational fluid-particle dynamics modeling of inhaled nanoparticles (1 to 100 nm) under low to moderate breathing conditions (5 to 14 L/min - human; and 0.14 to 0.40 L/min - rat) were performed in physiologically realistic human and rat nasal airways. The simulation emphasized olfactory deposition, and variations in airflow and particle flux caused by the inter-species airway geometry differences. Empirical equations were developed to predict regional deposition rates of inhaled nanoparticles on human and rat olfactory mucosa in sedentary breathing. Considering, breathing and geometric differences, quantified correlations between human and the rat olfactory deposition dose against a variety of metrics were proposed. Results: Regional deposition of nanoparticles in human and the rat olfactory was extremely low, with the highest deposition (< 3.5 and 8.1%) occurring for high diffusivity particles of 1.5 nm and 5 nm, respectively. Due to significant filtering of extremely small particles (< 2 nm) by abrupt sharp turns at front of the rat nose, only small fractions of the inhaled nanoparticles (in this range) reached rat olfactory than that in human (1.25 to 45%); however, for larger sizes (> 3 nm), significantly higher percentage of the inhaled nanoparticles reached rat nasal olfactory than that in human (2 to 32 folds). Taking into account the physical and geometric features between human and rat, the total deposition rate (#/min) and deposition rate per unit surface area (#/min/mm 2 ) were comparable for particles> 3 nm. However, when body mass was considered, the normalized deposition rate (#/min/kg) in the rat olfactory region exceeded that in the human. Nanoparticles < 1.5 nm were filtered out by rat anterior nasal cavity, and therefore deposition in human olfactory region exceeded that in the rat model. Conclusion: Regional deposition dose of inhaled nanoparticles in a human and rat olfactory region was governed by particle size and the breathing rate. Interspecies correlation was determined by combining the effect of deposition dosage, physical\geometric features, and genetic differences. Developed empirical equations provided a tool to quantify inhaled nanoparticle dose in human and rat nasal olfactory regions, which lay the ground work for comprehensive interspecies correlation between the two species. Furthermore, this study contributes to the fields in toxicology, i.e., neurotoxicity evaluation and risk assessment of UFPs, in long-term and low-dose inhalation exposure scenarios."
"Spatio-temporal assessment of social resilience to tropical cyclones in coastal Bangladesh Bangladesh; Cyclonic Storms; Disaster Tropical cyclones wreak havoc on the lives of coastal populations, especially in marginalised communities in developing countries where cyclone impacts are disproportionately lethal compared to developed countries. These populations must implement measures that enable them to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyclone impacts. Using empirical evidence, this study presents a spatio-temporally explicit, index-based assessment technique to assess social resilience to tropical cyclones. The key components of social resilience were extracted by Principal Component Analysis; distinct resilience indices were generated and mapped for the three disaster phases. The most influential components were then aggregated into an Effective Social Resilience Index (ESoRI), which was mapped across the study area. The technique was applied in a coastal sub-district of Bangladesh to demonstrate the approach. Basic preparedness training, emergency response, social bonding, and reconstruction and rehabilitation strongly influenced resilience in ways that corresponded closely to the phases of the disaster-management cycle: preparedness, response, and recovery. The spatial pattern of resilience revealed that social resilience varies significantly in time and space within a circumscribed locale. Importantly, areas close to the sea and rivers were found to be more resilient despite their high exposure to cyclones and lack of external support. This study will guide policymakers concerned with resilience building on a priority basis such as those working in resource-scarce conditions of developing countries."

"A triple bottom line approach to optimising odour removal from a residential water supply Waste Water; Life Cycle Assessment; Biosolids Feedwater to Euroa Water Treatment Plant contains increasingly high levels of natural organic matter (NOM) which were determined to cause its strong earthy odour. A multidisciplinary approach was used to evaluate the coagulation process to better remove the taste and odour (T&O) causing organics from water supplied to the local towns. Such high levels of NOM require elevated doses of coagulant for removal, accounting for approximately 60% of the chemical costs. A need arose to reduce these operational costs. However, community expectations regarding T&O, and social and environmental impacts, are not typically considered in this process. The local water corporation, Goulburn Valley Water, undertook a case study involving a comparison of three coagulants to optimise the chemical coagulation process from a multidisciplinary (triple bottom line, TBL) perspective. The financial assessment incorporated operational costs and potential infrastructure requirements. The social assessment investigated the overall impacts on staff operating the water treatment plant and their broader community involvement. The environmental assessment focused on the impact on downstream infrastructure from changes in sludge volumes and wastewater quality, and third-party greenhouse gas emissions from chemical deliveries. From a TBL viewpoint, aluminium chlorohydrate was the most beneficial option."

"Sustainable Power Generation Using Archimedean Screw Turbine: Influence of Blade Number on Flow and Performance Archimedes' Screw; Hydropower; Micro-Hydro Hydropower has been one of the mature renewable energy systems encompassing a major fraction of renewable energy. Archimedean screw turbines are gaining new interest in hydropower generation that are suitable for low head applications. This paper empirically and experimentally studies the flow inside Archimedean screw turbines along with the influence of blade numbers on their performance. The major objective of this work is to investigate performance and conduct design optimization of a screw turbine operating under ultra-low head (<0.2 m) conditions. Experimentally verified empirical results show its reliability in estimating the performance of turbines at low operational speeds. Further, the results show that with the increasing number of blades, the efficiency and power generation capacity can be increased, but the overall performance improvement relative to one blade turbine peaks at around 7 blades. Increasing the power generation capacity can in turn make the turbine compact and could be fabricated at a low-cost."
"Performance of high volume fly ash concrete incorporating additives: A systematic literature review Coal Ash; Silica Fume; Concretes Fly ash is commonly used as a partial cement replacement material, but this is limited to replacement levels of 30% or less, with significant quantities of fly ash still not utilized globally. There has been significant recent research into High Volume Fly Ash (HVFA) concrete to enable the utilization of fly ash and to reduce CO2 emission by reducing cement demand. This comprehensive review summarizes up to date literature on HVFA concrete with more than 50% of cement replacement using ASTM Class F low calcium fly ash. Firstly, the available HVFA literature in which only fly has been used to replace cement, is categorized based on the replacement level and the mechanical and durability property results are summarized. Secondly, the remaining literature is categorized based on the different material additions to modify the HVFA concrete and the results are compared. The summarized results are discussed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the reported results. The effect of each material addition on the HVFA concrete properties are also discussed to identify potentially more suitable additives for future development. Overall, this paper will provide an understanding of the current state of HVFA concrete research and the gaps in research for the development HVFA concrete containing higher replacement levels and achieving the required performance. Hence, summarised knowledge would significantly be beneficial to design prospective research towards a sustainable cement-free concrete using industrial waste."
"Techno-economic Evaluation of a 29-kW Micro-grid Hybrid Photovoltaic System for a Healthcare Center in Bangladesh Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems A micro-grid solar hybrid photovoltaic (PV) system has been designed for powering the remote healthcare center located at Charbhadrashan Upazila, Faridpur district in Bangladesh. Geographically, Bangladesh is a promising country for PV technologies, having an average of 4.5 kWh/m2/d solar insolation. The selected location for the work is an island into the mighty Padma River where the electric connection is not reliable for 24 hours service of a hospital. The considered roof-top PV system is comprised of 350 W solar panels, bi-directional inverter, generator, connecting wires, mounting system, and related accessories. In this assessment, state-of-the-art PV design software, HOMER Powering Health Tool has been utilized for estimating the load requirements, techno-economic and environmental evaluation of the micro-grid system. The load analysis revealed that a 29-kW grid-connected solar PV system is required for the hospital and the estimated net present cost (NPC) is US$29, 846, with a Levelized cost of energy is $0.045. Renewable electricity contributed 98% of this system's power requirement and the grid contributed only 2%. The annual production of this 25-year PV system is 43, 642 kWh/year and per unit, the electricity production cost is $0.058 which is significantly lower than today's average per-unit cost of $0.082 in Bangladesh. Besides, the system reduces 34.9 tons of CO2 emissions per year. Thus, this analysis suggested that the grid-connected PV system is a better configuration among other power sources for providing electricity to the health clinics in the absence of no electricity."

"Coffee farmer preferences for sustainable agricultural practices: Findings from discrete choice experiments in Vietnam Willingness To Pay; Stated Preference; Best-worst Scaling Despite the proven benefits of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs), adoption rates among farmers are still low, especially in developing countries. This paper seeks to assist policymakers devise approaches to encourage adoption by identifying the attributes of SAPs that can motivate Vietnamese coffee farmers to adopt them in production. Vietnam is the world's second largest coffee producer and the sector supports the livelihoods of over half a million people in the country. We conduct two different types of discrete choice experiments with over 300 Vietnamese coffee farmers to identify their SAP preferences. We analyse the data using cluster analysis and generalised multinomial logit models. The results are consistent across our different approaches. They show that these farmers have the strongest preferences for SAPs that can provide higher profits, lower risks (of output loss) and higher environmental benefits. These attributes received mean part-worth utilities of 0.251, 0.250 and 0.239 respectively. Attributes capturing the increase in daily operating efforts and time required to set up such practices are less important considerations. Further, the farmers are willing to pay on average between 26 and 32 million VND per hectare per year for a one level reduction in the risk of output loss and earn 15 million VND per hectare per year less in profits to achieve a one level increase in environmental benefits."

"How information sharing at information grounds helps reconnect a religiously divided society? Cafés, Christians and Muslims in Ambon, Indonesia Information Behaviour; Information Retrieval; Web Search Purpose: Different worldviews have been posed as constraining to information sharing. Religion is one element that constitutes the way people view the world. In many countries, religion has become a source for violent conflicts. This study investigates how Christians and Muslims in Ambon, Indonesia shared information at cafes situated at border areas and it helped the two religious communities reconcile their different worldviews after over a decade of living in conflicts. Design/methodology/approach: Informed by information grounds theory, this study analyzes data collected through a series of observation at three cafes situated at border areas and in-depth interviews with 31 informants. The analysis illuminates the processes that enable Christians and Muslims to exchange their different worldviews. Findings: This study found that, after the conflict, Christian and Muslim communities longed for the interaction they had with the other as it was before the conflict. However, these same communities tended to remain in there religiously homogenous environments as there was a conception that the others' area was unsafe. CafÃ©s at the borders became platforms to fulfill the need to meet with the other, promoting inter-religious interactions. At the cafÃ©s, an array of information was shared to establish mutual interests, from which more meaningful interpersonal relationships such as friendship and collaboration arose. Such relationships allowed regular visitors to exchange worldviews, re-stitching the broken social fabric in post-conflict Ambon. Originality/value: This study expands the applicability of information grounds theory to the context of a religious conflict in Southeast Asia. It demonstrates processes of how continuous interactions at information grounds can gradually facilitate communities with adversarial relationships to exchange their different worldviews."

"Public Sector Accountability to Implement Sustainable Development Goals in Sri Lanka: Influence of Traditional and Non-Traditional Donors Decision Making; Social Impact Assessment; Environmental Impact Statements Implementation of Sustainable development Goals (SDGs) for better environmental sustainability in developing countries in Asia has taken centre stage in response to the major environmental and social degradation created through rapid economic development in the region. Further, lack of clarity in environmental accountability of traditional economic developmental activities and internationally funded infrastructure development projects has resulted in reduced water and air quality and imperilled biodiversity. SDG related research in developing country context is limited and the impact of the funding bodies on public sector governance and accountability is scarce. This paper aims to fill this gap by addressing environmental accountability of public sector entities in internationally funded development projects in Sri Lanka, as a fast-developing country in Asia. The results indicate that environmental degradation is a continuing issue in Sri Lanka despite the efforts of traditional donor agencies monitoring and implementing environmental sustainability guidelines and SDG principles in infrastructure projects. The drastic change in the donor landscape experienced in the country with the rise of non-traditional donors and the deficiencies in public sector governance and accountability structures pose a significant threat to attainment of SDGs, including environmental sustainability in Sri Lanka."
"Achieving the SDGs: Evaluating indicators to be used to benchmark and monitor progress towards creating healthy and sustainable cities Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians In 2016, the World Health Organization declared that â€˜Health is one of the most effective markers of any city's successful sustainable developmentâ€™ (World Health Organisation, 2016). With estimates that around 6.7 billion people will live in cities by 2050, 21st century city planning decisions will play a critical role in achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They will determine the city structure and access to health-enhancing (or health-damaging) urban environments, and ultimately lifestyle choices that impact both individual and planetary health. Benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating city planning policies and interventions is therefore critical to optimise urban outcomes. In 2017, the UN adopted a global SDG indicator framework, calling for complementary national and regional indicators to be collected by member countries. UN Habitat has also developed an indicator action framework specifically for cities. This paper examined the extent to which the UN indicators will help cities evaluate their efforts to deliver sustainability and health outcomes. It identified inconsistencies between the two UN indicator frameworks. Many of the SDG indicators assess outcomes, rather than the comprehensive and integrated â€˜upstreamâ€™ policies and interventions required to deliver outcomes on-the-ground. Conversely, the UN Habitat framework incorporates intervention indicators, but excludes health outcome indicators. A more comprehensive approach to benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating policies designed to achieve healthy and sustainable cities and assessing spatial inequities is proposed."

ARESS ConTech Pty Ltd are seeking to develop technologies to enable improved construction and supply chain
efficiencies by developing standard designs, arrangements and services connections that comply with
Australian/NZ construction standards for modular housing. If a standard can be developed that meets building
standards, any supplier will be able to design modules for individual parts of a home by simply following the standard
The first prototype tested had one house as a module. The house is 4-bed 3-bath 2-car garage double-storey house,
the most popular family size product (not a 1:1 real one, but a simulation model). In this prototype, we adopted all
AS compliant products which satisfy building compliance but had negative results from both building surveyors and
our service engineers.
For a second prototype we split our whole house module into several smaller modules and with assembly of the
house in stages to fulfil building surveyors requests which passed building compliance but did not provide the
desired supply chain and labour efficiencies.
This project involves development and certification of a third prototype to try to overcome the issues with earlier

"Three sound installation prototypes for enhancing the quality of human life in public urban spaces Soundscape; Tranquility; Noise Control The soundscape approach presents a shift from traditional measurement-based approaches, towards perception-based modelling for understanding urban sound qualities. This change in practice amongst acoustics and engineering scholars creates the conditions for an interdisciplinary approach to urban soundscape design. I have previously argued, in a paper for Internoise 2019, that this shift informs a burgeoning 4th phase of soundscape design research that bridges the arts-science divide. The emerging perception-based work of acousticians and engineers opens up a new space of dialogue with the arts where perception has long been a focus of activity. This paper presents three recent sound installation prototypes that combine natural and technological elements, which are designed to create small, restorative urban spaces. Installation prototypes include: Fielding Overlay; Untitled; and, Undercurrent. To determine the impact of these sound installation prototypes on people's quality of life in urban spaces, it is proposed that the emerging qualitative assessment tools of the soundscape approach should be applied to the operative prototypes."

Biomimic neat membranes composed of two different types of phoshpholipid molecules: 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2- dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) were found to exhibit different absorption coefficients under the SNOM. The localization of the lipids could be identified and correlated to the morphology of the membrane domains indicating that SNOM can be an effective and accurate approach for the label-free characterization of the structure-function relationships in cell membranes."
"Techniques of the tactile body: A cultural phenomenology of toddlers and mobile touchscreens Touch Screens; Preschool Children; Toddlers A key dimension of young childrenâ€™s mobile media engagement and play centres on their embodied relations, and how these are shaped with and through the interfaces, materiality and mobility of haptic media. This article explores these embodied dimensions of young childrenâ€™s mobile media use, drawing on research from (1) ethnographic observation of young childrenâ€™s play practices in family homes, (2) analysis of videos of young childrenâ€™s tactile media interaction shared on YouTube and (3) analysis of user interface (UI) and mobile app developer literature, such as the â€˜Event Handling Guide for iOSâ€™, which encodes touchscreen interaction through the design constraints and possibilities of gesture input techniques. Taking as its starting point Marcel Maussâ€™ famous reflection on body techniques, this article draws on past and present research on mobile technologies, tactility and everyday life, to explore what might be involved in developing a â€˜cultural phenomenologyâ€™ of mobile touchscreens. This research and analysis reveals the emergence of what we term a haptic habitus or cultivation of embodied dispositions for touchscreen conduct and competence."

"Editorial 18:3 celebrating women in higher education on international women’s day Century Treatise; Valverde; Quixote We have timed publishing our first standard issue of the year to coincide with International Womanâ€™s Day, 8 March 2021 to celebrate the contribution women have made to higher education. The first woman documented as teaching in a university was more than 800 years ago, and yet it is only the last century that the number of female academics has started to increase (Whaley, 2011). In Australia, the first university was established in 1851, yet it would be another 32 years until Julia Guerin graduated in 1883 from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in 1883 (Women's Museum of Australia, 2020). And another 10 years when Leonora Little graduated from Melbourne University with a Bachelor of Science in 1983. Despite these accomplishments in the late 19th century, it was not until 1959 when the first woman, Dorothy Hill, was awarded a Chair appointment (Chair of Geology) in an Australian university, and nearly a century before Australia has its first female Vice Chancellor, when Dianne Yerbury became the Vice-Chancellor of Macquarie University in 1987, a position she held for twenty years. Australiaâ€™s higher education history tells a clear story of the slow integration of women in higher education, particularly within the STEM fields. For example, Little graduated in 1893 with a Bachelor of Science, but it was 1928 before the first female Lecturer in Mathematics, Ethel Raybould was appointed, and another 36 years before Hanna Neumann became the first female Professor of Pure Mathematics in 1964. It was just over 60 years ago that Margaret Williams-Weir was the first female Indigenous Australian to graduate with a university qualification in 1959. Female Indigenous Australians remain under-represented in the Australian university graduate population. The current situation for Australian higher education still retains a dominance of males within academic roles, such as 30 percent more men in Associate and Full Professor roles than women (Devlin, 2021). And whilst there has been progress in some jurisdictions, such as the majority of Queensland vice chancellors are women in 2021, these continue to be the exception, for example only 28% of vice chancellors in Australia are women. International Womanâ€™s Day is an opportunity to reflect on the significant contribution women make in higher education in Australia and globally. We celebrate through the publication of this issue, with many female authors from across higher education globally."
"Sustainability in fashion and textiles: A survey from developing country Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing The manufacturing of fashion and textiles involves many processes, which has high detrimental impact on the environment. The production of fashion and textile has been found to be one of the widely environmental polluting sectors. Environmental problems such as water and air pollution, generation of large amount of waste, use of a large amount of toxic chemicals and generation of large amount of wastewater are some of the problems associated with the fashion and textile production. Due to the increased global awareness to save the planet earth, many leading fashion brands have focused to reduce the pollution caused by the production of fashion and textiles. This chapter reviews the concepts of sustainability in fashion and textile production starting from fiber to the garment manufacturing, which can reduce pollution and achieve environmental sustainability. Furthermore, among different approaches taken to achieve environmental sustainability in the most impacting step, fabric chemical processing has been illustrated. The findings of a survey based on Vietnamâ€™s fashion and textile industries are also included in this chapter. We found that the large fashion enterprises are adopting fashion sustainability due to global competition, consumer awareness, and management policy, whereas the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are struggling to survive in the global market due to limited access to funding, lack of skilled people, and lack of consumer awareness."

"Life Quality Index–based cost–benefit analysis of equipping life preservers aboard airplanes Risk Assessment; Continuous Form; Multi-Attribute Utility Theory The life preservers aboard airplanes play a critical role in ensuring occupant safety in water-related accidents. However, several airlines off-load life preservers to save fuel and costs. In this study, a costâ€“benefit analysis was performed considering the Life Quality Index to examine the necessity of life preservers aboard aircraft. It was noted that the placement of life preservers aboard airplanes was reasonable and beneficial in the recent 15 years. Although life preservers are primarily required for extended overwater (EOW) operations, the distance from the shoreline for most of the water-related accidents was considerably smaller than that of an EOW operation, and most water-related accidents occurred close to an airport. In other words, air passengers were at risk of water-related accidents, regardless of whether the flight was classified as an EOW flight. Thus, life preservers must be made available for all the occupants on all passenger flights, regardless of the flight path."

"Donald and Tarnagulla Microgrid Feasibility Study – Area Hosting Capacity Assessment (administered by C4NET) This project aims at providing a detailed feasibility study for the proposed microgrid facilities at Donald and Tarnagulla. The project will particularly assess the hosting capacity of the two proposed sites where various hosting scenarios for self-generation will be considered, modelled and analysed. This project will explore different mix of generation technologies including solar, wind, diesel, biomass and gas power as well as storage and demand response to perform the hosting capacity analysis. The project will also consider the consumers’ behaviour by applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques on the available smart meter and network data. This will then be used to build reliable models for load profiling, which is critical for the hosting capacity assessment. Furthermore, the study will explore the feasibility and effects of advanced and innovative control technologies in increasing the hosting capacity of the proposed microgrids. The multi-institution research team of this project will bring a broad range of expertise to realise the project objectives and deliver the expected outcomes."

"The influence of the fortification of red pitaya (Hylocereus polyrhizus) powder on the in vitro digestion, physical parameters, nutritional profile, polyphenols and antioxidant activity in the oat-wheat bread Betalains; Hylocereus Polyrhizus; Antioxidant This study evaluated the physical parameters, polyphenol profile and antioxidant activity before and after the in vitro digestion of red pitaya powder-enriched oat-wheat bread compared to plain wheat bread, oat-wheat bread and red pitaya powder. The enrichment of red pitaya powder significantly increased the polyphenol, mineral contents, insoluble dietary fibre, firmness and moisture content of oat-wheat bread compared to wheat bread, while contributed to a minor reduction in bread volume and dough extensibility due to gluten dilution. The oat-wheat bread was found to have the lowest predicted glycaemic response, but 5%, 10% and 15% red pitaya powder formulated oat-wheat bread showed a significantly lower glycaemic response than plain wheat bread as well as red pitaya powder."
"Techno-economic performances of future concentrating solar power plants in Australia Parabolic; Solar Power Plants; Solar Thermal Energy The prediction of the techno-economic performances of future concentrated solar power (CSP) solar tower (ST) with thermal energy storage (TES) plants is challenging. Nevertheless, this information is fundamental to energy policymakers. This work aims to fill the knowledge gap regarding estimations of costs, amount, and quality of electricity produced by these plants over their lifetime. Every estimate should be based on real-world data of actual costs incurred to build and maintain constructed plants, and their actual electricity production, sampled with high frequency, to be reliable. Here we discuss as the available information is insufficient. There has been so far very limited transparency on the real cost and performance of CSP plants built and operated worldwide, and in the very few cases where data has been made public, for example, Crescent Dunes in the United States, costs have been much higher than expected, while annual average capacity factors have been much less. Important statistical parameters such as the standard deviation of the capacity factor with high-frequency sampling have never been provided. We conclude as the techno-economic performances of these plants are therefore unpredictable with accuracy until a significant number of plants will be built and operated, their costs and operating parameters will be shared, and their delivered techno-economic performances will be compared to the modeled values, finally permitting validation of the techno-economic analysis tools."

"Labour and regional transition: sex-segregation, the absence of gender and the valorisation of masculinised employment in Gippsland, Australia Gender Mainstreaming; Feminism; European Union This paper explores the place of gender in relation to labour and transition in regional development. A â€˜gendered lensâ€™ is applied to planning documents relating to the region of Gippsland, Australia. While previous research highlights the importance of accounting for gender in regional development, gendered analyses outside Europe are scarce. We argue that an apparent gender neutrality in planning documents in effect privileges masculinised elements of the economy. It means that current approaches to regional development, at best, reproduce the gendered status quo and, at worst, further re-entrench gender inequality in the region, with consequences for regional labour policy. Our findings have flow on effects for gender relations, and specifically for women, and economic policy in regions undergoing transition in Gippsland. We conclude that any regional policy that does not account for gendered realities and the lived experiences of women, ultimately fails the region."

"Comparing the environmental impacts of conventional and perpetual flexible pavements based on life cycle assessment Pavements; Road Maintenance; Roads This study conducted a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) between a perpetual flexible pavement and a conventional flexible pavement to quantify the associated energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Although perpetual flexible pavements adopt thicker asphalt layers and may generate greater environmental loads in the initial production and construction phases, they can provide life cycle environmental advantages when considering material consumption for maintenance interventions. The results of the study showed that the analyzed perpetual flexible pavement can save about 14.5% energy consumption and 18.5% CO2 emissions in the life cycle. Reduced maintenance can lead to a remarkable material decrease and is one of the main reasons for the environmental advantages associated with perpetual flexible pavements."
"Environmental impacts and leachate analysis of waste rubber incorporated in construction and road materials: A review Rubber; Tires; Infill In recent years, the recycling of waste tyre rubber in construction and road materials has emerged as a potential innovative solution to the growing waste rubber tyre dilemma. However, to determine the feasibility of any recycling method, it is crucial to assess the potential environmental implications of the proposed method. The environmental conditions waste tyre rubber products are exposed to are often not accurately simulated in leachate studies, leading to incomplete findings. The Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP) (1997) and Australian Bottle Leaching Procedure (ABLP) (1992), which have been used in most leachate studies in the past, have been criticised for inadequate replication of site conditions when applied to assess the leachability of modified materials. The objective of this study is to (1) review standard leachate testing methods and subsequently investigate the adequacy of these methods, (2) review all available major research focusing on the leaching characteristics and environmental and health implications of products recycled with waste tyre rubber, (3) prepare recommendations for the improvement of future leachate studies and testing based on the assessment of existing research. The existing leachate analysis studies that assess the environmental implications of different applications of waste tyre rubber have demonstrated that considerable knowledge gaps exist in the current body of knowledge. It was found leachate studies involving the recently published ABLP (2019) and Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF) (2017) appeared to better replicate local environmental conditions and yield results of higher integrity and precision due to improved testing procedures. This study recommends that the ABLP and LEAF testing methods be applied to assess the leachability of heavy metals and organic materials (on which minimal research has been conducted) of all currently available products incorporated with waste tyre rubber, as well as in future leachate studies of waste tyre rubber."
"In vitro corrosion of magnesium alloy AZ31 — a synergetic influence of glucose and Tris Magnesium Alloys; Biodegradable Implant; Corrosion Biodegradable Mg alloys have generated great interest for biomedical applications. Accurate predictions of in vivo degradation of Mg alloys through cost-effective in vivo evaluations require the latter to be conducted in an environment close to that of physiological scenarios. However, the roles of glucose and buffering agents in regulating the in vivo degradation performance of Mg alloys has not been elucidated. Herein, degradation behavior of AZ31 alloy is investigated by hydrogen evolution measurements, pH monitoring and electrochemical tests. Results indicate that glucose plays a content-dependent role in degradation of AZ31 alloy in buffer-free saline solution. The presence of a low concentration of glucose, i.e. 1.0 g/L, decreases the corrosion rate of Mg alloy AZ31, whereas the presence of 2.0 and 3.0 g/L glucose accelerates the corrosion rate during long term immersion in saline solution. In terms of Tris-buffered saline solution, the addition of glucose increases pH value and promotes pitting corrosion or general corrosion of AZ31 alloy. This study provides a novel perspective to understand the bio-corrosion of Mg alloys in buffering agents and glucose containing solutions."

"Pataphysics of finance: An essay of visual epistemology Accounting History; Double-Entry Bookkeeping; Social Responsibility Since the economic crisis of 2008, numerous observers have called into question the way that financial knowledge deals with economic reality. In this challenging context, the time has come to embark on a reflection about the role of finance (and financial knowledge) in our contemporary society. This article contributes to this reflection by expanding the process of research through a pataphysical parody illustrating the imaginary dimension of financial knowledge and its implications for accounting practices. Although this imaginary aspect of financial knowledge is often forgotten in finance, it is nevertheless very important since, as I will explain, it directly shapes the computerization of financial markets and can eliminate the economic referent of accounting signs. These claims will be discussed through the lens of a visual epistemology based on the science of imaginary solutions (pataphysics) to illustrate this imaginary nature of financial models. Discussion of the paradoxical consequences implied by increasing computerized implementation of an imaginary solution will ensue. More generally, this paper proposes, on one hand, an original (and critical) perspective on financial knowledge, and on the other hand, an invitation to discuss and escape (from) the mainstream paradigm for the purpose of promoting pluralism in finance."

"Monetary policy, corporate profit and house prices Macroeconomic News; Stock Market; Foreign Exchange By using portfolio theory, we explain the highly observed correlation between the seemingly unrelated corporate profit and house prices in the United States. We test the predictions of the underlying model using a vector autoregression representation and find the data to be supportive of the theory. Monetary impulses explain high correlation as both corporate profit and house prices exhibit similar dynamics in response to a monetary impulse. Robustness checks are presented by using the federal funds rate instead of the monetary base as a measure of the stance of monetary policy and by using other model variations. In all cases, the results are robust."
"Competencies or capabilities in the Australian higher education landscape and its implications for the development and delivery of sustainability education Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development The question of how to embed transformative change through the implementation of sustainability principles in our education systems has become increasingly important as complex situations, like pandemics and climate change, challenge societies. Education underpinned by a sustainability paradigm requires students to develop the ability to think critically about the nature of knowledge and about the ways in which knowledge is produced and validated. Educating for these skills will require shifts in educational practice, pedagogy and new approaches to learning and teaching. As the relationship between education and sustainability has matured, there has been increasing debate around whether capability or competence frameworks best underlie the type of education we seek to embed in sustainability professionals. Within an Australian context there is a philosophical difference between these two terms and an understanding of how this relates to different typologies of sustainability and education; Education about Sustainable Development, Education for Sustainable Development or Sustainability as Education (Sustainability Education) and this has yet to be fully explored. This is increasingly important as higher education is under pressure to be efficient producers of work-ready graduates. This paper provides an overview of the context of capability and competencies in the Australian higher education context and the associated implications for education, and sustainability education. It compares a competence approach with that of a capability approach and then situates this debate within the evolution of sustainability and education. Finally, it addresses some key consequences of the contemporary approaches to sustainability and education and emphasises the role of the capability approach."

"Blocking the human common beta subunit of the GM-CSF, IL-5 and IL-3 receptors markedly reduces hyperinflammation in ARDS models Interleukin 6; Rheumatology; COVID-19 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is triggered by various aetiological factors such as trauma, sepsis and respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Immune profiling of severe COVID-19 patients has identified a complex pattern of cytokines including granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-5, which are significant mediators of viral-induced hyperinflammation. This strong response has prompted the development of therapies that block GM-CSF and other cytokines individually to limit inflammation related pathology. The common cytokine binding site of the human common beta (Î²c) receptor signals for three inflammatory cytokines: GM-CSF, IL-5 and IL-3. In this study, Î²c was targeted with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) CSL311 in engineered mice devoid of mouse Î²c and Î²IL-3 and expressing human Î²c (hÎ²cTg mice). Direct pulmonary administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused ARDS-like lung injury, and CSL311 markedly reduced lung inflammation and oedema, resulting in improved oxygen saturation levels in hÎ²cTg mice. In a separate model, influenza (HKx31) lung infection caused viral pneumonia associated with a large influx of myeloid cells into the lungs of hÎ²cTg mice. The therapeutic application of CSL311 potently decreased accumulation of monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils without altering lung viral loads. Furthermore, CSL311 treatment did not limit the viral-induced expansion of NK and NKT cells, or the tissue expression of type I/II/III interferons needed for efficient viral clearance. Simultaneously blocking GM-CSF, IL-5 and IL-3 signalling with CSL311 may represent an improved and clinically applicable strategy to reducing hyperinflammation in the ARDS setting."

"Analysis of production safety in the construction industry of China in 2018 Construction Safety; Occupational Accidents; Accident Construction accidents are a significant hazard to the community, affecting sustainable development. This paper summarizes the safety situation of the construction industry in China over the past ten years. Detailed analysis is performed on fatal accidents that occurred in 2018 to reveal the spatiotemporal distribution pattern and characters of construction safety accidents. The construction failures are mainly attributed to management aspects rather than technical aspects. A case involving a major accident during shield tunnel construction in Foshan, Guangdong, in 2018 is investigated in detail. Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is used to analyze the management issues of the Foshan metro project during planning, geological investigation, design, and implementation of construction works. The SEA result shows that the safety risk was very high with a low total SEA score. Based on the analysis, a guideline for safety construction management for sustainability is proposed."
"Peanut Allergy: Characteristics and Approaches for Mitigation Allergens; Food Allergies; Amandin Peanut allergy has garnered significant attention because of the high sensitization rate, increase in allergy, and severity of the reaction. Sufficiently reliable therapies and efficient mitigating techniques to combat peanut allergy are still lacking. Current management relies on avoiding peanuts and nuts and seeds with homologous proteins, although adverse events mostly occur with accidental ingestion. There is a need for hypoallergenic peanut products to protect sensitized individuals and perhaps serve as immunotherapeutic products. Alongside traditional practices of thermal and chemical treatment, novel processing approaches such as high-pressure processing, pulsed ultraviolet light, high-intensity ultrasound, irradiation, and pulsed electric field have been performed toward reducing the immunoreactivity of peanut. Covalent and noncovalent chemical modifications to proteins also have the tendency to alter peanut allergenicity. Enzymatic hydrolysis seems to be the most advantageous technique in diminishing the allergenic potential of peanut. Furthermore, the combined processing approach (hurdle technologies) such as enzymatic hydrolysis followed by, or in conjunction with, roasting, high pressure and heat, ultrasound with enzymatic treatment, or germination have shown a significant reduction of peanut immunoreactivity and may emerge as useful techniques in reducing the allergenicity of peanut and other foods. This study represents our current knowledge about the alterations in allergenic properties of peanut via different processing mechanisms as well as evaluating its future potential, geographical based data on increasing sensitization, clinical relevance, eliciting dose, and current management of peanut allergy. Furthermore, the molecular characteristics and clinical relevance of peanut allergens have been discussed."

"Surprising Pseudogobius: Molecular systematics of benthic gobies reveals new insights into estuarine biodiversity (Teleostei: Gobiiformes) Animals; Maccullochella Macquariensis; Percichthyidae Snubnose gobies (genus Pseudogobius: Gobionellinae) are ubiquitous to, and important components of, estuarine ecosystems of the Indo-west Pacific. These small benthic fishes occur in freshwater, brackish and marine habitats such as mangroves, sheltered tide pools and lowland streams, and represent a model group for understanding the biodiversity and biogeography of estuarine fauna. To develop the species-level framework required for a concurrent morphological taxonomic appraisal, we undertook thorough sampling around the extensive Australian coastline, referenced to international locations, as part of a molecular systematic review using both nuclear and mitochondrial markers. The results indicate that while there are currently eight recognised species, the true diversity is close to double this, with a hotspot of endemism located in Australia. Complicated patterns were observed in southern Australia owing to two differing zones of introgression/admixture. Key drivers of diversity in the group appear to include plate tectonics, latitude, and historic barriers under glacial maxima, where an interplay between ready dispersal and habitat specialisation has led to regional panmixia but frequent geographic compartmentalisation within past and present landscapes. The findings have significant implications for biodiversity conservation, coastal and estuarine development, the basic foundations of field ecology, and for applied use such as in biomonitoring."

"Closing the loopholes in circular economy definitions and assessments using ontological criteria, with a demonstration for Australia Industrial Symbiosis; Sustainable Development; Circular Economy The burgeon concept of Circular Economy (CE) has fundamental issues hindering clarity and comprehensive assessments. This paper uses established ontological criteria to review and improve the CE definition and (assessment) frameworks. The review reveals that mainstream CE definitions and assessments are fuzzy, shift problems, oversimplified and not synchronized. This causes many loopholes that not lead towards sustainability. Therefore, an improved definition and framework is proposed, specifically for CE of XL to XS regions (scales from planetary to neighborhoods). A CE should strive towards self-sufficiency on each scale to avoid problems shifting to other regions or future society. The framework elaborates on a comprehensive systems-approach, which connects the triple bottom line across nine ecosystem processes, eight societal processes, and six economic production processes. The proposed definition and framework are demonstrated in an assessment of regional pressures and their impacts of Australia with 2020 data. The framework aims to better inform decision-makers on trade-offs between vital processes to minimize unintended problem shifting. The definition and framework have improved universal application for meaningful comparisons and optimization towards a sustainable CE in any region."

"Review of research for two decades for women leadership in higher education around the world and in Vietnam: a comparative analysis Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to find the studies conducted on women leadership in higher education (WLHE) in the past 20 years to understand as to how the trend has changed over the past two decades around the world and particularly in Vietnam for women leaders in higher education institutions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a systematic review of 93 articles published in the past 20 years in WLHE. The articles were classified based on the country of research and the research methods used. Findings: The study concluded that most of the research in WLHE had been done in the USA and Canada, with a dearth of literature on WLHE in Asia, and only six studies so far have been done in Vietnam, with only two studies being done before 2017. Vietnam is gaining importance in research in WLHE may be because of the increased female labour participation rate and growth in the gross domestic product. Practical implications: This study provided some recommendations at the societal, institutional and individual levels, which can help in women empowerment and help women take up the leadership roles. Originality/value: Although a variety of reviews have been conducted focusing on different areas in higher education, there is a small number of literature review studies in the field of women leaders in higher education, especially in Vietnam and Asia. Hence, the current study will add this missing part to the growing body of literature in WLHE."

"Microplastics alter digestive enzyme activities in the marine bivalve, Mytilus galloprovincialis Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Microplastics are eaten by many invertebrates, particularly filter-feeding organisms like mussels. Since microplastics can be retained in the digestive system for extended periods, there is ample opportunity for them to interact with the functions of digestive enzymes. This study determined how the polymer type, size and concentration of ingested spherical microplastics affects the activities of seven key digestive enzymes in the digestive gland of Mytilus galloprovincialis, a common marine mussel. Polymer type significantly affected the activities of carbohydrase enzymes: polystyrene reduced amylase and xylanase activities, and increased cellulase activity. High concentrations of microplastics (5 Ã— 104 microplastics Lâˆ’1) caused a 2.5-fold increase in total protease activity. The activities of laminarinase, lipases and lipolytic esterases were unaffected by the polymer type, size or concentration of microplastics. Microplastics-induced changes to digestive enzyme activities can affect mussels' ability to acquire energy from food and reduce their energy reserves."
"A spatial and temporal analysis of forest dynamics using Landsat time-series Landsat; Land Cover; Remote Sensing Understanding forest dynamics at the landscape scale is critical given the demands of sustainable forest management and climate change mitigation. This study proposes an approach for holistically characterising and analysing forest dynamics across large areas and long-time periods using information derived from Landsat time-series. To achieve this, we first developed a two-phase classification process to predictively map (1) disturbance and recovery levels and (2) disturbance causal agents for multiple detected disturbance events. The model explanatory data included a range of trajectory-based metrics derived from Landsat time-series, while model training and validation data were derived from a human-interpreted reference dataset. While previous studies have often described forest dynamics using some specific spectral change metrics, we demonstrated an ensemble approach to map disturbance and recovery trends (by treating them as a single metric) and to characterise not only abruptly occurring change events (e.g., clear-fell logging and wildfire) but also events of low severity (e.g., prescribed burning and selective logging). In addition, we adopted a space-time data cube concept to simultaneously report both newly detected disturbance events (detected disturbances) as well as events that have previously occurred but are ongoing (ongoing disturbances). This ongoing element of forest dynamics is often under-reported. The method was tested over 3.7 million ha of public land sclerophyll forests, where multiple disturbance events have occurred over the last 30 years (1987â€“2016). Our models of disturbance and recovery levels obtained overall accuracies of 78.6% and 72.3% for primary and secondary disturbance events, respectively. The overall accuracies for the models of disturbance causal agents were 80.7% and 73.0%, respectively. The data cube reported an average annual disturbance rate of 4.2% per year. This was dominated by newly detected disturbance (2.7% per year) as distinct from ongoing disturbance that was, however, considerable (1.5% per year). Our approach presented herein can improve the understanding of forest dynamics over long time periods and large areas and has potential for supporting land managers."

"Estimates of potential childhood lead exposure from contaminated soil using the USEPA IEUBK model in Melbourne, Australia Lead Level in Blood; Lead Poisoning; Lead Blood Level Soils in inner city areas internationally and in Australia have been contaminated with lead (Pb) primarily from past emissions of Pb in petrol, deteriorating exterior Pb-based paints and from industry. Children can be exposed to Pb in soil dust through ingestion and inhalation leading to elevated blood lead levels (BLLs). Currently, the contribution of soil Pb to the spatial distribution of childrenâ€™s BLLs is unknown in the Melbourne metropolitan area. In this study, childrenâ€™s potential BLLs were estimated from surface soil (0â€“2 cm) samples collected at 250 locations across the Melbourne metropolitan area using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic (IEUBK) model. A dataset of 250 surface soil Pb concentrations indicate that soil Pb concentrations are highly variable but are generally elevated in the central and western portions of the Melbourne metropolitan area. The mean, median and geometric soil Pb concentrations were 193, 110 and 108 mg/kg, respectively. Approximately 20 and 4% of the soil samples exceeded the Australian HIL-A residential and HIL-C recreational soil Pb guidelines of 300 and 600 mg/kg, respectively. The IEUBK model predicted a geometric mean BLL of 2.5 Â± 2.1 Âµg/dL (range: 1.3â€“22.5 Âµg/dL) in a hypothetical 24-month-old child with BLLs exceeding 5 and 10 Âµg/dL at 11.6 and 0.8% of the sampling locations, respectively. This study suggests childrenâ€™s exposure to Pb contaminated surface soil could potentially be associated with low-level BLLs in some locations in the Melbourne metropolitan area."

"Marine reserves stabilize fish populations and fisheries yields in disturbed coral reef systems Marine Protected Areas; Marine Parks; Environmental Protection Marine reserve networks are increasingly implemented to conserve biodiversity and enhance the persistence and resilience of exploited species and ecosystems. However, the efficacy of marine reserve networks in frequently disturbed systems, such as coral reefs, has rarely been evaluated. Here we analyze a well-mixed larval pool model and a spatially explicit model based on a well-documented coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) metapopulation in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia, to determine the effects of marine reserve coverage and placement (in relation to larval connectivity and disturbance heterogeneity) on the temporal stability of fisheries yields and population biomass in environmentally disturbed systems. We show that marine reserves can contribute to stabilizing fishery yield while increasing metapopulation persistence, irrespective of whether reserves enhance or diminish average fishery yields. However, reserve placement and the level of larval connectivity among subpopulations were important factors affecting the stability and sustainability of fisheries and fish metapopulations. Protecting a mix of disturbed and non-disturbed reefs, rather than focusing on the least-disturbed habitats, was the most consistently beneficial approach across a range of dispersal and reserve coverage scenarios. Placing reserves only in non-disturbed areas was the most beneficial for biomass enhancement, but had variable results for fisheries and could potentially destabilize yields in systems with well-mixed larval or those that are moderately fished. We also found that focusing protection on highly disturbed areas could actually increase variability in yields and biomass, especially when degraded reef reserves were distant and poorly connected to the meta-population. Our findings have implications for the design and implementation of reserve networks in the presence of stochastic, patchy environmental disturbances."
"Smarter education: Leveraging stakeholder inputs to develop work ready curricula Campus; Internet Of Things; Sea Resource Society expects higher education institutions to produce a competent labor force composed of graduates who are well equipped with the knowledge, skills, and attributes required for contributing to the economy in todayâ€™s fast-paced digital age. The ability of graduates to transition successfully into employment is explained by the concept of graduate work readiness, which is of escalating interest to employers worldwide. Adaptability, flexibility, complex problem solving, and innovativeness are critical work-ready skills for Industry 4.0 workplaces. This paper frames work readiness as an essential component of smart education. Smart education in todayâ€™s digital age is complex and thus requires the coordination and cooperation of multiple stakeholders. Focusing on adaptation, the first level of the smart systems model, this study draws upon stakeholder theory to propose a new conceptual framework for the collaborative codesign of adaptive smart curricula to foster student work readiness."

"On-chip plasmonic spin-Hall nanograting for simultaneously detecting phase and polarization singularities Optical Vortex; Vortex; Gaussian Beams Phase and polarization singularities are important degrees of freedom for electromagnetic field manipulation. Detecting these singularities is essential for modern optics, but it is still a challenge, especially in integrated optical systems. In this paper, we propose an on-chip plasmonic spin-Hall nanograting structure that simultaneously detects both the polarization and phase singularities of the incident cylindrical vortex vector beam (CVVB). The nanograting is symmetry-breaking with different periods for the upper and lower parts, which enables the unidirectional excitation of the surface plasmon polariton depending on the topological charge of the incident optical vortex beam. Additionally, spin-Hall meta-slits are integrated onto the grating so that the structure has a chiral response for polarization detection. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the designed structure fully discriminates both the topological charges and polarization states of the incident beam simultaneously. The proposed structure has great potential in compact integrated photonic circuits."
"Evolution of user navigation behavior for online news Political Participation; Social Media; Media Use Purpose: The purpose of the study is to use web serer logs in analyzing the changes of user behavior in reading online news, in terms of desktop and mobile users. Advances in mobile technology and social media have paved the way for online news consumption to evolve. There is an absence of research into the changes of user behavior in terms of desktop versus mobile users, particularly by analyzing the server logs. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors investigate the evolution of user behavior using logs from the Malaysian newspaper Berita Harian Online in April 2012 and April 2017. Web usage mining techniques were used for pre-processing the logs and identifying user sessions. A Markov model is used to analyze navigation flows, and association rule mining is used to analyze user behavior within sessions. Findings: It was found that page accesses have increased tremendously, particularly from Android phones, and about half of the requests in 2017 are referred from Facebook. Navigation flow between the main page, articles and section pages has changed from 2012 to 2017; while most users started navigation with the main page in 2012, readers often started with an article in 2017. Based on association rules, National and Sports are the most frequent section pages in 2012 and 2017 for desktop and mobile. However, based on the lift and conviction, these two sections are not read together in the same session as frequently as might be expected. Other less popular items have higher probability of being read together in a session. Research limitations/implications: The localized data set is from Berita Harian Online; although unique to this particular newspaper, the findings and the methodology for investigating user behavior can be applied to other online news. On another note, the data set could be extended to be more than a month. Although initially data for the year 2012 was collected, unfortunately only the data for April 2012 is complete. Other months have missing days. Therefore, to make an impartial comparison for the evolution of user behavior in five years, the Web server logs for April 2017 were used. Originality/value: The user behavior in 2012 and 2017 was compared using association rules and Markov flow. Different from existing studies analyzing online newspaper Web server logs, this paper uniquely investigates changes in user behavior as a result of mobile phones becoming a mainstream technology for accessing the Web."

"Body armor for stab and spike protection, Part 2: a review of test methods Silicon Dioxide; Impregnated Fabrics; Kevlar (Trademark) In many countries, stabbing is still the most common cause of homicide. It is difficult to quantify the magnitude of the force used in a stabbing incident by an alleged assailant. Pathologists describe the stabbing force using relative subjective terms, such as mild, moderate, considerable or severe. More precise objective evaluation of the severity of stabbing is very important for quantitative understanding of stab wounds and for scientific assessment of the effectiveness of stab-resistant armor. In this perspective review, the standard objective methods used for the quantification of the protection provided by the stab and spike or puncture resistant materials are described. In addition, the nonstandard test methods developed by various research organizations have also been discussed. This paper is a follow-up to the previous paper (Body armor for stab and spike protection, Part 1: scientific literature review) published in the Textile Research Journal. Special emphasis has been given to the recent developments in both test standards and experimental methodologies used to evaluate stab and spike protection. This paper has systematically reviewed the standard test methods used for evaluating the stab and spike protection performance of body armor for comparisons. Furthermore, the backing materials, which are used for stab and puncture resistance tests to quantify the back-face deformation, were highlighted. Also, the approach for the wearerâ€™s trial to predict the performance was discussed. This paper will provide guidelines to researchers, manufacturers and defense department working in the area of design and fabrication of body armor systems."

"Environmental and anthropogenic influences on ambient background concentrations of fluoride in soil Fluorides; Pollution; Euphausia Superba Excess exposure to fluoride causes substantive health burden in humans and livestock globally. However, few studies have assessed the distribution and controls of variability of ambient background concentrations of fluoride in soil. Ambient background concentrations of fluoride in soil were collated for Greater Melbourne, Greater Geelong, Ballarat and Mitchell in Victoria, Australia (n = 1005). Correlation analysis and machine learning techniques were used to identify environmental and anthropogenic influences of fluoride variability in soil. Sub-soils (>0.3 m deep), in some areas overlying siltstone and sandstone, and to a lesser extent, overlying basalt, were naturally enriched with fluoride at concentrations above ecological thresholds for grazing animals. Soil fluoride enrichment was predominantly influenced by parent material (mineralogy), precipitation (illuviation), leaching during palaeoclimates and marine inputs. Industrial air pollution did not significantly influence ambient background concentrations of fluoride at a regional scale. However, agricultural practices (potentially the use of phosphate fertilisers) were indicated to have resulted in added fluoride to surface soils overlying sediments. Geospatial variables alone were not sufficient to accurately model ambient background soil fluoride concentrations. A multiple regression model based on soil chemistry and parent material was shown to accurately predict ambient background fluoride concentrations in soils and support assessment of fluoride enrichment in the environment. Few studies have assessed environmental/anthropogenic controls of background fluoride concentrations at a regional scale (e.g. not associated with a key point source of contamination). For the first time, a geochemical regression tree model for the estimation of ambient background fluoride concentrations in soil has been developed and is shown to have promise for application for predicting areas of fluoride enrichment/risk in soils."

"Tropical cyclone early warnings for the regions of the Southern Hemisphere: strengthening resilience to tropical cyclones in small island developing states and least developed countries El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Wind Shear; Cyclogenesis Tropical cyclones (TCs) affect countries in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) tropics every year causing significant humanitarian impacts and much damage to the natural environment. To reduce TC impacts on societies, early warning systems (EWS) are used to communicate the risk to the public. In 1999, the Climate Change and Southern Hemisphere Tropical Cyclones International Initiative (CCSHTCII) was established to enhance EWS for TCs in SH countries, with particular focus on support for small island developing states and least developed countries to provide effective public early warnings of TC risk. In this paper, recent activities of the CCSHTCII to strengthen TC EWS are presented. Using TC best track data from the SH TC historical data archive, the impact of the El NiÃ±oâ€“Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on inter-annual and spatial variability of TC activity is examined. TC-ENSO relationships in the SH are analysed and used as a scientific basis for the production of TC season outlooks. Communication of TC early warnings through TC season outlooks is described, and recommendations for improving outlooks are provided."

"Development of a patient-specific immobilisation facemask for radiation therapy using additive manufacturing, pressure sensors and topology optimisation Radiation Oncology; Radiotherapy; Cancer Purpose: Radiotherapy relies on the delivery of radiation to cancer cells with millimetre accuracy, and immobilisation of patients is essential to minimise unwanted damage to surrounding healthy cells due to patient movement. Traditional thermoformed face masks can be uncomfortable and stressful for patients and may not be accurately fitted. The purpose of this study was to use 3D scanning and additive manufacturing to digitise this workflow and improve patient comfort and treatment outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The head of a volunteer was scanned using an Artec Leo optical scanner (Artec, Luxembourg) and ANSYS (Ansys, Canonsburg, USA) software was used to make two 3D models of the mask: one with a nose bridge and one open as would be used with optical surface guidance. Data based on measurements from ten pressure sensors around the face was used to perform topology optimisation, with the best designs 3D printed using fused deposition modelling (FDM) and tested on the volunteer with embedded pressure sensors. Findings: The two facemasks proved to be significantly different in terms of restricting head movement inside the masks. The optimised mask with a nose bridge effectively restricted head movement in roll and yaw orientations and exhibited minimal deformation as compared to the open mask design and the thermoformed mask. Originality/value: The proposed workflow allows customisation of masks for radiotherapy immobilisation using additive manufacturing and topology optimisation based on collected pressure sensor data. In the future, sensors could be embedded in masks to provide real-time feedback to clinicians during treatment."

"Low-temperature elemental mercury removal over TiO2 nanorods-supported MnOx-FeOx-CrOx Flue Gases; Mercury; Coal-Fired Power Plant TiO2 nanorods-supported MnOx, FeOx, CrOx, and MnOx-FeOx-CrOx catalysts have been prepared by a deposition-precipitation method, with the aim of investigating the combination of ternary metal oxides effect on elemental mercury (Hg0) removal. The TiO2 nanorods-supported MnOx-FeOx-CrOx catalyst manifested the superior Hg0 removal efficiency (âˆ¼80-83%) at low temperatures (100â€“200 Â°C) in the presence of O2. The addition of NO promoted the Hg0 removal efficiency under the same reaction conditions. Further, SEM, HRTEM, XRD, BET surface area, and XPS characterization were carried out to explore the physicochemical properties of the catalysts. It was found that the integration of three active metal oxides contributed to the enrichment of active sites and the surface adsorbed oxygen species, thereby improving the catalytic activity. Additionally, both the large surface area and high crystallization of the obtained TiO2 nanorods resulted in uniform dispersion of the manganese-iron-chromium mixed metal oxide nanoparticles and a high activity. Further, XPS data of spent MnOx-FeOx-CrOx/TiO2 catalyst indicated that the presence of Mn4+, Cr6+, and Fe3+ could promote Hg0 oxidation due to the strong synergistic interaction between the TiO2 nanorods-incorporated MnOx, FeOx, and CrOx nanoparticles."

"Ethnic women in sơn la province, northern vietnam: The entrepreneurial landscape Migrant Workers; Self-Employment; Ethnic Business This article examines differences in the propensity to engage in entrepreneurial activities among ethnically diverse women in SÆ¡n La Province, a disadvantaged and mountainous rural area of Vietnam. Propensity for entrepreneurialism is examined by focusing on (a) womenâ€™s use of technology, (b) experiences of financial difficulties, and (c) propensity for risk-taking. Analyzing surveys completed by 135 women, we find that plans to start a business are equally apparent among women from diverse ethnic groups. We establish a positive association between levels of entrepreneurialism (practicing entrepreneurs, intending entrepreneurs, and non-entrepreneurs) and the use of technology. However, we find no association between entrepreneurialism and access to finance/financial difficulties or risk-taking. Women from very small ethnic minorities often report never using the Internet, and they seek loans from private lenders who charge relatively high interest rates. Our findings suggest a need for greater government investment in rural areas to increase womenâ€™s access to and use of technology."

"Migration pathways for frontline care workers in australia and new zealand: Front doors, side doors, back doors and trapdoors Migrant Workers; Unfree Labour; Emigration And Immigration This article examines the use of migration law and policy to address the labour needs of the care sector in two jurisdictions. New Zealand uses an Essential Skills visa to allow the direct entry of care workers on a temporary basis while Australia relies on a range of overseas born entrants including international students and working holiday makers, to meet labour supply challenges in the care sector and to supplement the local workforce, which includes many long-term permanent migrants. Changes to the work rights of working holiday makers, together with the introduction of a Designated Area Migration Agreement for Northern Australia and a Pacific Labour Scheme have created new opportunities for temporary entrants to work in care occupations but there is pressure on the Australian Government to open a dedicated temporary labour migration pathway for care workers. New Zealandâ€™s revolving door of temporary migrant care workers and Australiaâ€™s de facto low skilled migration pathway both present regulatory challenges with regard to the protection of these workers in the labour market, their claims to citizenship and their opportunity to realise the â€˜triple winâ€™ promised in the temporary labour migration literature. The increasing reliance by Australia and New Zealand on temporary migrant care workers to meet the labour supply challenges in the sector also masks a range of other endemic employment relations problems in the sector (in particular, low pay) and may lead to a permanent demand for temporary migrant workers at the expense of local care workers."

"Effects of furnace annealing on in situ reacted Ti2AlC MAX phase composite coatings deposited by laser cladding Ti3Sic2; Spark Plasma Sintering; Mechanical Properties The ability to deposit mm-scale coatings that are metallurgically bonded to substrates shows great promise for the fabrication of components coated with expensive materials, for their resistance to heat, radiation damage or oxidation in extreme environments. Although considered excellent candidates, in situ laser clad MAX phase coatings on metal substrates have found limited success due to the low proportion of MAX phase in the products. In this work, low-purity laser clad MAX phase coatings were subjected to post-deposition furnace annealing at 1350 Â°C to improve the Ti2AlC purity. Aside from a thin oxide layer on the coating surface, a pure Ti2AlC layer was formed immediately below. In total, the coatings were found to exist as seven microstructurally unique sub-layers due to equilibration of supersaturated phases formed during the laser cladding process. No delamination between any layers was observed. The phase identification and microstructure, as determined using XRD, SEM and EDS, are described in detail. Some unique microstructures were observed, including dendritic Ti2AlC MAX phase grains produced from a topochemical reaction between TiCx and TiyAlz regions, and Î±-Ti supersaturated with up to 33 at.% C. The kinetically trapped phases produced within the coating using this process may offer a strong combination of material properties which could be advantageous for use in extreme environments."

"Changing the Climate on Corporate Emissions Despite climate change being well established in science (IPCC, 2014) and broader society (Hawkins et al., 2017), the process of developing corporate reporting guidelines has been relatively recent (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, 2017, ASIC, 2018) and primarily voluntary (Sullivan and Gouldson, 2017). In the context of rising corporate contribution to climate change (Pearse and Bohm, 2014 ), and the severity of its impacts (World Bank, 2018, IPCC, 2014), this provides an ideal opportunity for studies which address the development, measurement and reporting of climate change related KPls. The objectives of this research include a shift in focus in the ways organisations recognise, measure and report on key climate change indicators; shifting to more effective KPls with the capacity to meaningfully reduce Australia's carbon emissions."

"Factors influencing green building development in Kazakhstan Green Building; Construction Industry; Project Delivery Green buildings have been actively spreading as a solution for sustainability issues of the construction industry in at least the last two decades. As green building practices unfold in developing countries, the need of identifying factors that both hinder and drive its spread rises. Multiple studies reveal a general inconsistency among results in different parts of the world, caused by each countryâ€™s environmental, economic, and social conditions. Taking into account the experience of developing international green buildings and the current state of green building development in Kazakhstan, this study aims to spread the understanding of the factors that hinder and have the potential to drive the development of green buildings in Kazakhstan. A questionnaire survey was carried out among 38 industry experts in Kazakhstan to accomplish study objectives. Multiple data analysis methods were used to identify correlations among groups of experts and rank the factors. The results revealed a lack of skill/experience, a lack of government support, and the high cost of sustainable materials and products as the most crucial barriers. Water and energy efficiency, improved health of occupants, comfort, and satisfaction were identified as the most influential drivers. By expanding knowledge on factors affecting the implementation of green buildings, the study uncovered common trends in the responses of professionals, providing valuable information for field professionals and suggesting future research recommendations."

"Settling Time Estimation in Synchronization of Impulsive Networks with Switching Topologies Complex Dynamical Networks; Time Lag; Exponential Synchronization This article addresses the problem of synchronization of impulsive networks with switching topologies. A new synchronization framework is established with an emphasis on settling time estimation. The impulsive networks consist of physical nodes and cyber modules. For physical nodes, states are changed impulsively at discrete time instants due to some switching phenomena or unexpected sudden noises. For cyber modules, two cases of switching scenarios are considered for information exchange patterns during specific time intervals. In the first case, cyber modules lose all the communication links with others, resulting in disconnected topologies. Then, a distributed controller is proposed for nodes without intrinsic nonlinear dynamics. A distinguished feature of this controller is its capability to estimate a bound for settling time, beyond which the synchronization with respect to a virtual target is guaranteed. In the second case, cyber modules lose some communication links but build other new ones with the help of a smart communication center to form connected topologies. A distributed controller is further designed for nodes in the presence of intrinsic nonlinear dynamics. Accordingly, a sufficient condition is derived to achieve synchronization with an estimated settling time bound. For both cases, the estimated bounds are able to reveal the relationship between the impulsive strength and the synchronization performance. Finally, numerical examples including a case study on a modified IEEE 34 bus test feeder are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers."

"Disturbance Observer based Anti-Windup Resonant Control of Integrated EV Drive in Standalone Vehicle-to-Home Mode Charging (Batteries); Switched Reluctance Motor; Integrated This paper presents a disturbance observer based resonant control of a switched reluctance motor (SRM) integrated electric vehicle (EV) drive in stand-alone vehicle to home (V2H) mode considering propagation time-delay. First, a detailed averaged model of the integrated drive is developed including the time-delay. Then a discrete-time resonant control strategy based on the disturbance observer architecture with intrinsic anti-windup capability is formulated. It is shown that the proposed control structure offers a convenient two-stage design process i.e. the observer and the controller. It is also shown that the resulting control architecture exhibits strictly stable dynamics without any marginally stable modes, while the resonant action is obtained by embedding the resonant disturbance model into the observer. The results of the proposed control (considering the time-delay) are compared with the resonant control without considering the propagation time-delay to highlight the improvements in dynamic performance. Different test scenarios are presented with linear and nonlinear load types and simulation results are presented."
"Correlates of walking among disadvantaged groups: A systematic review Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are less likely to be physically active. Walking is important to public health, therefore understanding correlates of walking will inform the development of targeted interventions. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the correlates of walking among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults. PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus were searched up to February 2020 and titles/abstracts and full-texts were screened against eligibility criteria. Methodological quality was assessed. Correlates were synthesized when two or more comparisons were available. 35 studies were selected for synthesis. 21 examined overall walking, 16 examined leisure-time walking and 9 examined walking for transport (8 examined two or more types of walking). Employment status, home ownership, self-rated health, density or number of social ties, perceived neighborhood aesthetics, perceived walkability and perceived individual safety were positively associated with overall walking. Social support for physical activity from friends and family and perceived individual safety were positively associated with leisure-time walking. Objective walkability, perceived walkability and perceived individual safety were positively associated with walking for transport. Most studies were cross-sectional, did not report response rates and used a validated measure of physical activity. Strategies to improve self-rated health, social ties, neighborhood aesthetics, walkability and perceptions of individual safety should be the focus of interventions that aim to improve walking among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Recommendations for future studies include the need to focus on leisure-time walking and walking for transport; the correlates of walking in males; prospective longitudinal designs; psychological, cognitive and emotional variables; and social, behavioral attributes and skills."

"An investigation of the environmental sustainability of palm biomass supply chains via dynamic simulation modeling: A case of Malaysia Biomass; Supply Chain Design; Biomass Power With the ever-increasing need for clean and accessible energy sources, biomass has long been considered as a potential prospect. Malaysia is one of the leading suppliers and has the largest palm oil plantation in the world. Therefore, biomass from the palm oil industry appears to be a very promising alternative source of raw materials, including for renewable energy, in Malaysia. However, ensuring the environmental sustainability of the biomass supply chain (BSC) is one of the major challenges faced by the biomass industry. Therefore, this paper aims to assess the effect of changing the efficiency of transportation technology (TT) and production technology (PT) on the environmental sustainability of the palm oil BSC. We developed a dynamic simulation model to explore the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 50 years (2000â€“2050) for three palm biomass suppliers (Johor, Perak and Pahang) in Malaysia. Results show that supplier in Perak produced the highest rate of GHG emissions in the whole system. Also, suppliers in Johor and Perak had the highest GHG emissions with 180â€“240 million tonnes (mt) CO2 equivalent (CO2e) and 375â€“400 mt CO2e, respectively, from transportation of empty fruit bunches (EFB) product. In terms of production, the supplier in Perak had the highest (and constant value) of GHG emissions (up to 160 mt CO2e). The analysis shows that the supplier in Pahang generated the lowest level of GHG emissions. Our findings suggest that improvement of the transportation and production efficiency of BSC should be the priority to work towards the sustainable development of the palm biomass industry."

"Additives migrating from 3D-printed plastic induce developmental toxicity and neuro-behavioural alterations in early life zebrafish (Danio rerio) Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter The environmental impact of exposure to 3D-printed plastics as well as potential migration of toxic chemicals from 3D-printed plastics remains largely unexplored. In this work we applied leachates from plastics fabricated using a stereolithography (SLA) process to early developmental stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity. Migration of unpolymerized photoinitiator, 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (1âˆ’HCHPK) from a plastic solid phase to aqueous media at up to 200 mg/L in the first 24 h was detected using gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry. Both plastic extracts (LC50 22.25% v/v) and 1âˆ’HCHPK (LC50 60 mg/L) induced mortality and teratogenicity within 48 h of exposure. Developmental toxicity correlated with in situ generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an increase in lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation markers and enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in embryos exposed to concentrations as low as 20% v/v for plastic extracts and 16 mg/L for 1âˆ’HCHPK. ROS-induced cellular damage led to induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis which could be pharmacologically inhibited with both antioxidant ascorbic acid and a pan-caspase inhibitor. Neuro-behavioral analysis showed that exposure to plastic leachates reduced spontaneous embryonic movement in 24â€“36 hpf embryos. Plastic extracts in concentrations above 20% v/v induced rapid retardation of locomotion, changes in photomotor response and habituation to photic stimuli with progressive paralysis in 120 hpf larvae. Significantly decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity with lack of any CNS-specific apoptotic phenotypes as well as lack of changes in motor neuron density, axonal growth, muscle segment integrity or presence of myoseptal defects were detected upon exposure to plastic extracts during embryogenesis. Considering implications of the results for environmental risk assessment and the growing usage of 3D-printing technologies, we speculate that some 3D-printed plastic waste may represent a significant and yet very poorly uncharacterized environmental hazard that merits further investigation on a range of aquatic and terrestrial species."
"Industry 4.0: Development of a multi-agent system for dynamic value stream mapping in SMEs Lean Manufacturing; Value Stream Mapping; Kaizen As the next wave of productivity, Industry 4.0 aims to enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of manufacturers by bridging the gap between industrial manufacturing and information technology. Through digitalisation, it provides the advantage of enabling the real-time/near-real-time monitoring of manufacturing. This digital information allows monitoring tools such as Value Stream Mapping (VSM) to help the decision makers efficiently capture the non-value-adding processes on the factory floor. However, the application of VSM into small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), including diverse manufacturing environments, is not an easy task. It is even more challenging especially when the product processing is more complicated and requires improvements to labour management and facility utilization. Conventional VSM is not competent to handle the contemporary rapid dynamic manufacturing environment, complex material flow or efficiency of machine and labour performance. These three are the most important resources on the shop floor to bring transparency to the decision maker. We present a multi-agent system composed of several cost effective embedded Arduino systems as agents and a Raspberry-PiÂ® as a core agent. Equipped with Cyber-Physical System (CPS) technology, these agents, placed on or near the station, can reflect the non-linear material value flow without modelling the process or using RFID tags. Moreover, through the sensor node installed in each machine and by knowing the staff ID, the agents could send the relevant information in the form of dynamic value stream mapping (DVSM) in near-real-time for storage, analysis and visualization. We present a suitable visualization tool based in Node-REDÂ® to carry out DVSM."

"A practical approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from open dumps through infrastructure restructuring: A case study in Nanjing City, China Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste A new environmental ban has forced the restructure of open dumps in China since 1 July 2011. A technical process was established in this study that is feasible for the upgrade of open dumps through restructuring. The feasibility of restructuring and the benefit of greenhouse gas emission reductions were assessed according to field surveys of five landfills and four dumps in Nanjing. The results showed that the daily processing capacities of the existing landfills have been unable to meet the growth of municipal solid waste (MSW), making restructuring of the landfills imperative. According to an assessment of the technical process, only four sites in Nanjing were suitable for upgrading. Restructuring the Jiaozishan landfill effectively reduced the leachate generation rate by 5.84% under its scale when expanded by 60.7% in 2015. CO2 emissions were reduced by approximately 55,000-86,000 tons per year, in which biogas power generation replaced fossil fuels Fossil fuels accounted for the largest proportion, up to 45,000-60,000 tons. Photovoltaic power generation on the overlying land has not only reduced CO2 emissions to 26,000-30,000 tons per year but has also brought in continuing income from the sale of electricity. The funds are essential for developing countries such as China, which lack long-term financial support for landfill management after closure."

"Combine ingress of chloride and carbonation in marine-exposed concrete under unsaturated environment: A numerical study Chlorine Compound; Chlorides; Carbonation Under marine environment, reinforced concrete structures are suffering from serious deterioration problems. The sea water contains abundant contents of ion species including chlorides, and the carbon dioxide exists in the air, which could be exclusively high under industrial-polluted condition. Both the chloride transport and carbonation could happen, intrude through the concrete protection layer and trigger corrosion for the inside rebar. During this process, the mechanism of synergetic work of carbon dioxide, chloride ions and moisture are investigated in the present study. The carbonation process impacts the chloride transport by debounding, while the pore structure will also change, so that the transport characters vary for both. The effects of crucial environmental parameters, the temperature, the relative humidity and the carbon dioxide concentration, on the interaction of carbonation and chloride transport process, are also scrutinized. Considering the existence of liquid in the pore phase, this work principally examined the influence of unsaturated environment on the binary ingress process of chloride and carbonation."

"Anaerobic digested effluent phycoremediation by microalgae co-culture and harvesting by Moringa oleifera as natural coagulant Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water In this study, a microalgal co-culture of Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp. was cultivated in a photobioreactor (PBR). The microalgal biomass was then harvested by locally available and inexpensive natural coagulants, Moringa oleifera seed powder. Overall microalgal growth rate, biomass productivity, and nutrient efficiency have been analyzed. The linear correlation among the ammonia-N (NH3â€“N), orthophosphate (PO43), and microalgae concentration demonstrated that nitrogen and phosphorus removal had been dominated by microalgal assimilation. The experimental results suggested that the anaerobic reactor effluent was a useful substrate for microalgae growth. The maximum biomass productivity and growth rate was 0.12 g/L/d and 0.50 dayâˆ’1, respectively, and almost 89 Â± 1% of the nutrient was removed within 5 days. Besides, Moringa oleifera seed powder showed a very high microalgal biomass harvesting efficiency of 85%. Hence, it can be concluded that this cost-effective microalgae cultivation and harvesting method could tailor a promising phycoremediation application worldwide."
"Punk feminism and #FEAS: A low-brow protest of academic sexism Metals; Heavy Metal Music; Metal Scene In this chapter, we reflect on several arts-based â€˜pop-upâ€™ interventions that were created and performed at educational conferences by #FEAS Feminist Educators Against Sexism, a feminist collective that was founded in Australia in 2016 that has international reach. The interventions under discussion here aimed at protesting the everyday sexism that women face in the university workplace. We make connections between these interventions and with a feminist punk ethos and a do-it-yourself (DIY) attitude that characterized the 1990s feminist punk music scene. In doing so, we are able to see traces of punk feminism in #FEAS interventions and argue they provide an important mode to mobilize and connect feminists to resist sexism in the academy."

"‘You’re actually the problem’: manifestations of populist masculinist anxieties in Australian higher education Student Evaluation of Teaching; Course Evaluation; University Teacher In 2016 the world witnessed a consolidation of a western brand of political â€˜populist authoritarianismâ€™ that is anti-globalisationalist and creates â€˜shared objects of loathingâ€™ in the popular imagination. This article engages with the implications of this affective and masculinist â€˜post-truthâ€™ era for higher education and analyses the narratives of teacher educators who teach compulsory classes based on inclusion and diversity. The article uses the work of feminist, Indigenous and queer theorists to explore gendered responses to pedagogical encounters recounted in the data. We offer a reading of these experiences that links white male objections, particularly around the teaching of gender and race, to the growth of neoconservatism that precipitated the contemporary rise of populist authoritarianism. The pedagogical encounters we explore reflect the notion that the Australian white male is a figure who is brought undone by allowing the subaltern to speak."
"Effective thermal conductivity of an intact heterogeneous limestone Rock; Shales; Gas Permeability The Cobourg limestone is a very low porosity rock consisting of lighter nodular regions that are predominantly calcite and darker regions consisting of calcite, quartz, dolomite, and an appreciable clay fraction. This paper presents the application of the theory of multi-phasic composites to estimate the possible maximum effective thermal conductivity of the heterogeneous rocks. The thermal conductivity estimates are expected to be representative of the intact rock, without fractures or fissures that can influence the heat conduction process. The estimates are therefore indicative of the thermal properties of the rock in undisturbed regions unaffected by the influences of stress relief and excavation damage during construction of deep ground repositories for the disposal of heat-emitting nuclear waste."
"Exploring a new incubation model for FinTechs: Regulatory sandboxes Business Development; Science Parks; Incubators Research on incubation models indicates that incubators and accelerators are crucial catalysts for the development of start-ups. To facilitate start-ups in financial markets, several regulatory authorities have adopted a new incubation model called a â€˜regulatory sandboxâ€™. Regulatory sandboxes enable eligible applicants to test their technology-enabled financial solutions for a certain period of time (subject to conditions the regulator imposes). As such, these instruments allow innovation while preventing severe instability in financial markets caused by systemic risk. Despite their importance, management research has devoted little attention to studying how sandboxes operate as a new incubation model. In our abductive study, we adopt the activity system framework and a qualitative analysis approach to investigate the activities of five leading sandboxes and compare them with the activities of other incubation models. The data analysis yielded an activity model with three design elements (achieving membership, participating and detaching) and one design theme (improving connectedness). Thus, sandboxes are characterized by providing regulatory guidance and facilitating access to testing across international jurisdictions, distinguishing them from both generic and specialized incubation models. Our primary contribution to the incubation literature is extending the knowledge of a unique incubation model through a set of theoretical propositions."

"Metal additive manufacturing in aerospace: A review Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Metal additive manufacturing involves manufacturing techniques that add material to produce metallic components, typically layer by layer. The substantial growth in this technology is partly driven by its opportunity for commercial and performance benefits in the aerospace industry. The fundamental opportunities for metal additive manufacturing in aerospace applications include: significant cost and lead-time reductions, novel materials and unique design solutions, mass reduction of components through highly efficient and lightweight designs, and consolidation of multiple components for performance enhancement or risk management, e.g. through internal cooling features in thermally loaded components or by eliminating traditional joining processes. These opportunities are being commercially applied in a range of high-profile aerospace applications including liquid-fuel rocket engines, propellant tanks, satellite components, heat exchangers, turbomachinery, valves, and sustainment of legacy systems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of metal additive manufacturing in the aerospace industry (from industrial/popular as well as technical literature). This provides a current state of the art, while also summarizing the primary application scenarios and the associated commercial and technical benefits of additive manufacturing in these applications. Based on these observations, challenges and potential opportunities are highlighted for metal additive manufacturing for each application scenario."

"Indonesia in the spotlight: Combating corruption through ICT enabled governance Open Government; Transparency; E-Governance This paper puts Indonesia in the spotlight assessing the country's ability to combat corruption through ICT enabled governance. The research firstly tries to define governance through the different lens of intergovernmental organisations. This is followed by a comparative analysis of different situational characteristics of governance in developing and developed countries. The paper then explores the role of governance in Indonesia, highlighting the existing barriers, and potential drivers to the implementation of ICT in Indonesia. It is concluded that ICT enabled good governance needs to be in place to support the eradication of corruption in Indonesia. Corruption in Indonesia is considered systematic as the practice is prevalent across public organisations in the country. This study contributes to the information systems discipline by offering new insights into the issues of implementing ICT enabled open governance in developing countries such as Indonesia."

"Liveability aspirations and realities: Implementation of urban policies designed to create healthy cities in Australia Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Creating healthy, liveable cities is a common policy aspiration globally. However, little research has explored the capacity of urban policies to deliver this aspiration, or levels of policy implementation. This study aimed to develop policy-relevant indicators, to detect within- and between-city inequities in the implementation of Australian state government policy targets related to urban liveability. Seventy-three government policies were reviewed across Australia's four largest cities to identify measurable spatial policies that contribute to creating healthy, liveable neighbourhoods. Spatial indicators based on these policies were developed to assess and map levels of policy implementation at the metropolitan and sub-metropolitan level. Measurable spatial policies were identified for only three out of seven policy domains: walkability, transit access, and public open space. While there was significant variation between cities, policies were often inconsistent with evidence about how to achieve liveability. No Australian city performed well on all liveability domains. Even modest policy targets were often not achieved, and there were significant spatial inequities in policy implementation. With few exceptions, people living in outer suburbs had poorer access to amenities than inner-city residents. This study demonstrates the benefits and challenges of measuring urban policy implementation. Evidence-informed targets are needed in urban, transport and infrastructure policies designed to create healthy, liveable cities, to enable levels of (and inequities in) policy implementation to be assessed. Consistent standards for government spatial data would enable development of comparable indicators and cities to be directly compared."
"Improving the information availability and accessibility of antenatal measurements to ensure safe delivery: A research-based policy recommendation to reduce neonatal mortality in indonesia Small For Gestational Age; Pregnancy; Birth Weight Purpose: Assessing the risks and preventable causes of maternal and neonatal mortality requires the availability of good-quality antenatal information. In Indonesia, however, access to reliable information on pregnancy-related results remains challenging. This research has proposed a research-based policy recommendation to improve availability and accessibility to vital information on antenatal examinations. Patients and Methods: Descriptive statistics were used to characterize midwivesâ€™ capabilities in routinely gathering and recording antenatal information during pregnancy. The investigation was carried out among 19 midwives in South Kalimantan, Indonesia, from April 2016 to October 2017. Antenatal data on 4946 women (retrospective study) and 381 women (prospective study) have been accessed through a scientific andtechnicaltrainingprogram. Results: To date, lack of timely access to antenatal information has hampered the process of reducing neonatal mortality in Indonesia. The post-training statistical analysis showed that the training has significantly improved midwivesâ€™ scientific knowledge and technical abilities in providing more reliable data on antenatal measurements. Conclusion: Consistent scientific and technical training among midwives is required to update their knowledge and skills, particularly those relating to documenting the results of antenatal examinations at different stages of pregnancy and using that information to assess potential risks and identify necessary interventions. This should also be followed by routine monitoring on the quality of collected antenatal data. This can be one of the enabling actions to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals target in reducing neonatal mortality in Indonesia."

"The impacts of different biological treatments on the transformation of explosives waste contaminated sludge Trinitrotoluene; Cyclonite; Bioremediation The dinitrotoluene isomers 2,4 and 2,6â€dinitrotoluene (DNT) represent highly toxic, mu-tagenic, and carcinogenic compounds used in explosive manufacturing and in commercial production of polyurethane foam. Bioremediation, the use of microbes to degrade residual DNT in industry wastewaters, represents a promising, low cost and environmentally friendly alternative technology to landfilling. In the present study, the effect of different bioremediation strategies on the degradation of DNT in a microcosmâ€based study was evaluated. Biostimulation of the indigenous microbial community with sulphur phosphate (2.3 g/kg sludge) enhanced DNT transformation (82% trans-formation, from 300 g/L at Day 0 to 55 g/L in week 6) compared to natural attenuation over the same period at 25 Â°C. The indigenous microbial activity was found to be capable of transforming the contaminant, with around 70% transformation of DNT occurring over the microcosm study. 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that while the original bacterial community was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria (30%), the addition of sulphur phosphate significantly increased the abun-dance of Betaproteobacteria by the end of the biostimulation treatment, with the bacterial community dominated by Burkholderia (46%) followed by Rhodanobacter, Acidovorax and Pseudomonas. In summary, the results suggest biostimulation as a treatment choice for the remediation of dinitrotol-uenes and explosives waste."

"Cold vapor integrated quartz crystal microbalance (CV-QCM) based detection of mercury ions with gold nanostructures Mercury Vapor; Quartz Crystal Microbalances; Gold Nanoparticle In this study, we developed a novel method of integrating the well-accepted cold vapor technique with gold nanostructured based quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) devices to selectively detect mercury ions (Hg2+). This method allows for the conversion of aqueous mercury ions into elemental mercury (HgÂ°) vapor form and thereon use the highly sensitive QCM based mercury vapor sensors to detect the evolved mercury. The method involves reducing mercury chloride (HgCl2) in contaminated water by mixing it with a 2% tin chloride (SnCl2) solution in order to evolve HgÂ° vapor from the liquid mixture. The selectivity and sensitivity performance of each gold nanostructure, namely, the control Au thin film (Au-ctrl), Au-nanospheres (Au-NS) and Au-nanourchins (Au-NU), towards mercury vapor was evaluated. It was found that Au-NS and Au-NU sensors displayed up to 79% and 243% higher response magnitudes than the Au-ctrl sensor for various concentrations of HgCl2, respectively. All three sensors exhibited repeatable sensing performance when reporting the concentrations from 5 sensing events involving 500 ppb HgCl2 solution with Au-ctrl, Au-NS and Au-NU having the coefficient of variance (CoV) values of Ëœ5.7, 2.9 and 3.8%, respectively. Moreover, the sensors were observed to operate in the linear region with the mercury ion concentration range calibrated and tested. Importantly, the sensors showed no cross-interference effects when tested toward Hg2+ ions with and without the presence of other metal ions such as lead, cadmium, manganese, iron, and zinc. The results indicate that the CV-QCM technique developed is feasible to be potentially used in real-world mercury monitoring applications."
"Protecting human rights in youth detention: listening to the voices of children and young people in detention Incarceration; Imprisonment; Reentry Human rights abuses and entrenched cultural problems have been exposed in youth detention centres across Australia in recent years. Australiaâ€™s recent commitment to a comprehensive system of human rights monitoring under the UN Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture by January 2022 creates the opportunity to better protect rights. This includes ensuring that monitoring bodies overseeing youth justice detention engage effectively with the children and young people. It is widely recognised that these young people have commonly experienced significant disadvantage, and that the overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people in detention is an intergenerational legacy of the destruction wrought by colonisation. Monitoring methodologies must ensure that children and young people detained can participate in the monitoring process, and are protected from possible reprisals. This article will outline the legal background to these monitoring requirements and make practical recommendations for effective monitoring in youth justice detention."

"Understanding the contextual influences of the health outcomes of residential energy efficiency interventions: realist review Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Residential energy efficiency interventions are complex social and construction programmes that may benefit health, yet the interactions between the material improvements, health and health-related outcomes, and householder responses are not well understood. While indoor winter warmth and householder satisfaction have been identified as the key mediators for physiological, mental and social health outcomes, this paper explores how programme contexts may have influenced the outcomes. This review revealed that common target populations were low income households, children and the elderly. The review found that peopleâ€™s expectations and culturally constructed heating practices influenced indoor temperatures and householder satisfaction. Very deprived households were still affected by financial constraints despite the intervention measures. Excessive ventilation and limited technical mastery counteracted the beneficial effects of the intervention measures. Poor workmanship and ineffective handover undermined energy consumption objectives and led to householder dissatisfaction. Effective intervention design should address householder needs and the programmeâ€™s sociocultural context."

"Carbon encapsulated iron oxide for simultaneous Fenton degradation and adsorption of cationic and anionic dyes from water Biosorbents; Congo Red; Adsorption Adsorption and Fenton oxidation processes are considered the most effective ways to treat industrial dye effluent. However, the separation of adsorbent materials and the leaching of secondary pollutants are big hurdles. To resolve these issues, here, we have developed a unique hybrid structure (Fe3O4 @C) by encapsulating iron oxide into carbon shells using olive mill waste in a one-step process. The resulting unique core-shell Fe3O4 @C structure possessed both tunned surface functional groups (carboxylic, carbonyl, and amines) and magnetic properties, which can be easily separated from treated water using a magnet. Upon using Fe3O4 @C as a catalyst, it simultaneously removed/ degraded both Congo red (CR) and methylene blue (MB) up to 94% through Fenton oxidation. ICP-MS analysis detected negligible (6.6 ppb) iron leaching even in Fenton degradation, which is far lower than the allowable leaching limit of 300 ppb showing the efficacy of the developed structure. This is due to the core-shell structure where Fe3O4 remains active inside the core due to dual protection by encapsulating inside a semicrystalline carbon shell, which is then protected by a porous carbon matrix. This double protection assists high adsorption and maintains efficient charge transfer that favors high catalytic activity with limited iron leaching. Further to prove this Fe3O4 @C was used in 5 consecutive adsorption cycles, where it removed 94.4% MB after 5th cycle and even preserved the pristine core-shell structure and chemical bonds as indicated by ex-situ Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, High-angle annular dark field, High-angle annular bright field, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Hence, this study successfully showed that olive waste could be converted into a functional material that can further be used at a large scale for pollutant removal from wastewater."

"Governing the entrepreneurial discovery of blockchain applications Entrepreneurial Intention; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the institutional context of the entrepreneurial discovery of blockchain applications. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on institutional and entrepreneurial theory to introduce the economic problem entrepreneurship in the early stages of new technologies, examines the diversity of self-governed hybrid solutions to coordinating entrepreneurial information and draws policy implications. Findings: To perceive a valuable and actionable market opportunity, entrepreneurs must coordinate distributed non-price information under uncertainty with others. One potential class of transaction cost economising solution to this problem is private self-governance of information coordination within hybrids. This paper explores a diverse range of entrepreneurial hybrids coalescing around blockchain technology, with implications for innovation policy. Originality/value: This paper points to the problem of how the defining of the innovation problem as either choice-theoretic or contract-theoretic changes the remit of innovation policy. Innovation policy and blockchain policy should extend beyond correcting sub-optimal investments or removing barriers to action, to incorporate how polices impact entrepreneurial choices over governance structures to coordinate information."
"Voluntary sustainability assurance, capital constraint and cost of debt: International evidence Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative We examine whether a firm's voluntary purchase of sustainability assurance is associated with reduced capital constraint and lower cost of debt. We also explore the effect of assurance provider (accountant/non-accountant) and a country's level of investor protection/creditor rights, on this association. Using a panel dataset drawn from an international sample, we find that voluntary purchase of sustainability assurance is negatively associated with both capital constraint and cost of debt. The associations are stronger for accounting firm providers than non-accounting assurers. Further, the effect is stronger for firms operating in low investor protection (creditor rights) settings suggesting that voluntary sustainability assurance is valued in a context generally characterized by greater information asymmetry. Findings provide evidence that firms derive a financing benefit from voluntary sustainability assurance, and the benefit is sensitive to the profile of the sustainability assurance provider and the institutional environment in which the firm operates."
"Navigating climate change risk: the role of management accountants in implementing the TCFD framework Please note re: contract: RMIT University agrees to the standard research contract, with the exception of changes to Clause 5.1(i) and the omission of Clause 6.5, as discussed with and confirmed by Jacky Pfennig, CIMA Research and Development Manager, 20 August 2020 (Vanessa from Contracts).

Significant challenges for companies are presented by the recommendations to disclose climate change related financial risks arising from the 2017 Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). There are several major obstacles faced by corporations in reporting climate change risk in alignment with TCFD recommendations which need to be addressed (O’Dwyer & Unerman, 2020). One such obstacle is the is tension between the traditional role of accounting and an increasing need to focus on longer term strategic issues such as climate change risk. The potential contribution that management accountants can make in overcoming such obstacles is significant, particularly when applying their combined knowledge of analytical accounting techniques and business acumen (Linnenluecke et al. 2015). The objective of this study is therefore to provide a better understanding of how management accountants can contribute to corporate responses to TCFD requirements. We aim to explore how management accountants can contribute to the development of appropriate climate-related scenarios and to better integrate this into organisational strategy. Such an understanding is timely and warranted as the pressure for quality disclosure of climate change risk and risk management strategies escalates. In-depth interviews of management accountants will be utilised as the main mode of data for this study."
"Energy Security Evaluation Through Solid Waste Management in Dhaka City, Bangladesh Energy Security; China; Security of Supply Energy security is usually the relationship between national security and natural resources for energy production in a particular state for which enhancing energy security to produce sustainable energy production has made it significant. Furthermore, being an occupied nation Bangladesh hopes to be an advanced country by 2041, and hence, electricity enhancement is significant for any nation's sustainable development. Therefore, investigation on energy security in Bangladesh should be continued so that shortage of energy demand can be resolved, such as solid waste conversion to energy production. However, solid waste management (SWM) is one of the most severe ecological complications threatening urban areas, especially in Dhaka, the capital city in Bangladesh. Research shows that swift growth rate has boosted up surplus and thereby it is important to find the alternate option in the energy process from waste. With this view, an evaluation of the power enhancement through SWM and energy production in Dhaka city corporation (DCC) stipulates the prospects and skills well-matched for Bangladesh. The study shows that the rate of waste production was increased from 1.00 million to 4.5 million tons from the year 2000 to 2050 for which electricity generation is 340 GWh in 2000 whereas, the projected value is 1444 GWh in the projected year through the incineration process under the context of ultimate analysis. It is also observed that the daily waste generation in DCC is about 3768 tons in 2005 and thereby, producing a total of 1.38 million tonnes in a year which will be doubled by 2030. Hence, this huge amount of waste will emit a significant amount of CO2 for which the mixed mode of SWM and energy production process could be recommended so that the policymakers can take the decision about adopting the WtE technology through SWM for a better environmental place and sustainable economy."

"'I didn't even know it was a thing': Australian young adults' experience of economic abuse Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Economics of Scale Economic abuse is a form of intimate partner violence that involves one partner controlling or restricting, exploiting or sabotaging the economic resources of the other partner. Little is known how economic abuse manifests in young people's relationships or how to prevent it. This study explored young adults' experiences of economic abuse and identified the factors associated with economic abuse in their relationships. Twenty-four young adults (18 women and 6 men) aged 18-29, were interviewed in-depth using both unstructured narrative and semi-structured interview questions. Thematic analysis was used to identify forms of economic abuse. Common experiences of economic abuse included: exploitation of financial and other resources, controlling access to money, damage to property and sabotage of employment and study. The contextual factors included lack of awareness of economic abuse, valuing love and relationships over money and fear of conflict and rejection. We argue that economic abuse prevention strategies should target young adults in their relationship formation stage and take into account the context of relationships and the issues young people face when venturing into cohabitation."
"Building supply chain relational capital: The impact of supplier and customer leveraging on innovation performance Alliance Portfolios; Firm; Open Innovation Leveraging suppliers and customers, in order to build closer inter-organisational ties, is often highlighted as a competitive priority in global supply chains (SCs). The creation of relational capital (RC) within a firm is a well-researched concept; however, few studies investigated the customer/supplier leveraging mechanisms that build relational capital in SCs. In this study, we propose a model to examine the effects of supplier and customer leveraging on the creation of RC, which impacts innovation performance (IP). The empirical data for this study were drawn from the fifth round of the Global Manufacturing Research Group survey project (data collected from 557 manufacturing plants, in 10 countries). The hypotheses were empirically tested using structural equation modelling. The findings highlight the importance of SC leveraging towards building RC, in order to enhance innovation performance. The results show that supplier and customer leveraging positively impact the RC. In turn, the RC has a significant impact on IP. We found that the effect of SC leveraging directly and indirectly (partial mediated by RC) associates with the innovation performance. These findings are underpinned by the relational view, which argues that the relationships between firms are an important unit of analysis for understanding competitive advantage."
"‘Everybody needs friends’: Emotions, social networks and digital media in the friendships of international students Transnationalism; Human Migration; Dual Citizenship The importance of kin relations and neighbourhoods has received considerable attention in research on transnational migration. Further, research in transnational families and digital media highlights the strategies for maintaining family relationships By contrast, research on friendship is currently limited and, more so, the centrality of the emotional aspects of friendships as intimacy as well as networks of support has received less attention, particularly from a culturally comparative perspective. Drawing on qualitative research in Melbourne (n = 59) and Singapore (n = 61), this article examines the ways in which international students invest in developing friendships with other international students based on shared circumstances in the cities in which they are living and studying. The article contributes to fields of literature in transnational migration and cross-cultural perspectives towards friendship and argues that the kinds of friendship forged by the experiences of international students are significant for capturing an aspect of the diversity of migrant relationships."
"Point absorber wave energy harvesters: A review of recent developments Wave Energy; Hydrodynamics; Heaving Even though ocean waves around the world are known to contain high and dense amounts of energy, wave energy harvesters are still not as mature as other forms of renewable energy harvesting devices, especially when it comes to commercialization, mass production, and grid integration, but with the recent studies and optimizations, the point absorber wave energy harvester might be a potential candidate to stand out as the best solution to harvest energy from highly energetic locations around the world's oceans. This paper presents an extensive literature review on point absorber wave energy harvesters and covers their recent theoretical and experimental development. The paper focuses on three main parts: One-body point absorbers, two-body point absorbers, and power take-offs. This review showcases the high amount of work being done to push point absorbers towards technological maturity to eventually kick off commercialization and mass production. It should also provide a good background on the recent status of point absorber development for researchers in the field."

"Metals extraction processes from electronic waste: constraints and opportunities E-Waste; Electronic Waste; Electronic Equipment The skyrocketing demand and progressive technology have increased our dependency on electrical and electronic devices. However, the life span of these devices has been shortened because of rapid scientific expansions. Hence, massive volumes of electronic waste (e-waste) is generating day by day. Nevertheless, the ongoing management of e-waste has emerged as a major threat to sustainable economic development worldwide. In general, e-waste contains several toxic substances such as metals, plastics, and refractory oxides. Metals, particularly lead, mercury, nickel, cadmium, and copper along with some valuable metals such as rare earth metals, platinum group elements, alkaline and radioactive metal are very common; which can be extracted before disposing of the e-waste for reuse. In addition, many of these metals are hazardous. Therefore, e-waste management is an essential issue. In this study, we critically have reviewed the existing extraction processes and compared among different processes such as physical, biological, supercritical fluid technologies, pyro and hydrometallurgical, and hybrid methods used for metals extraction from e-waste. The review indicates that although each method has particular merits but hybrid methods are eco-friendlier with extraction efficiency > 90%. This study also provides insight into the technical challenges to the practical realization of metals extraction from e-waste sources. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]"

"The occurrence of microplastic in specific organs in commercially caught fishes from coast and estuary area of east China Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter It is important to understand where microplastics go in the body of organisms. They can readily affect target organs and transport microplastic-associated chemicals to humans via consumption. The plastics (>20 Î¼m) in guts and gills of 13 species of fishes from coast estuary areas of China were examined for the presence of microplastics. Muscle and liver were analyzed from a commercial species, the Asian seabass (Lateolabrax maculatus), of which 73% of the suspected items were verified by micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. We targeted the organ specific distribution of microplastics. Microplastics were detected in gut and gills in 22%-100% and 22%-89% of total individuals, respectively. Microplastics in gut varied from 0.3 to 5.3 items/ind. and varied from 0.3 to 2.6 items/ind in gill, respectively. The size of microplastics in gills were smaller than those found in the guts. No microplastics were detected in the liver or muscle tissue of L. maculatus, and several non-plastic items detected in muscles can be attributed to background contamination. Further research is required using a larger number of specimens and better quality control and quality assurance are required to assess the presence of small microplastics or nanoplastics in fishes internal organs and muscle."

"Proactive-Enabling climate justice learning from the frontlines Despite extensive studies of the climate change implications for health, there is limited understanding of what enables fair and just
health outcomes for those most vulnerable under a changing climate. Community service organisations (CSOs) work at the frontlines
of understanding and addressing this climate justice challenge; often while fiscally, time, and human resource constrained. This project
will enable a collaboration between a range of Victorian CSOs and ‘The Climate Change Exchange’ to identify and begin to address
the CSOs capability building needs with regard to climate change adaptation. ‘The Exchange’ is a team of experienced researchers
and practitioners that addresses research needs, fosters collaborations, and provides guidance and professional development for
those wanting to apply the latest insights into adaptation and mitigation. This collaboration will be guided by CSO needs and priorities,
and the skills building methods will be co-designed and evaluated with them. Overall, this project will provide proof-of-concept that The
Exchange can support CSOs in these ways, and develop a business case for a larger cohort of work beyond June 2020."

"Characterisation of the intestinal microbiota of commercially farmed saltwater crocodiles, Crocodylus porosus Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus The Australian saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) industry began commercially in the 1980s, producing skins for export and crocodile meat as a by-product. Industry research has thus far focused on strategies to improve production efficiency. In the current study, we utilised 16S rRNA sequencing to characterise the intestinal microbiome of Australian saltwater crocodiles. Samples were collected from 13 commercially farmed crocodiles from six sample sites along the length of the intestinal tract. The results indicate a similar microbiome composition to that found in the freshwater alligator, with the dominate phyla represented by Firmicutes, primarily Clostridia, and Fusobacteria, which appears to be distinct from mammalian, fish, and other reptile phyla which are generally dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The high abundance of â€˜pathogenicâ€™ bacteria, with no apparent consequence to the hostâ€™s health, is of great interest and warrants further additional investigation. This will enable expansion of the current understanding of host immune function and how it is modified by host and intestinal microbiome interactions."

"Measuring the inequality of accessible trams in Melbourne Public Transport; Accessibility; Transit In Melbourne, public policy has recently been enacted to improve access to the tram service with an emphasis upon people with a disability. Achieving that objective requires two elements. One is a low-floor tram and two is an elevated tram stop platform that facilitates boarding the tram. Currently the fleet of trams in Melbourne is made up of high-floor and low-floor designs, thus accessible services are unevenly distributed. In addition, construction of new tram stop platforms has been uneven. This suggests a form of inequality in accessible tram services for the disabled. Several studies of transport services have addressed this issue using the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve calculations as seen in studies of disadvantaged groups such as the elderly. This research utilizes those approaches to estimate the current access of the disabled population to trams services in Melbourne. The approach compares the geography of the total and accessible tram services with the geography of the total and disabled population using the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve. The results show that there is inequality in the accessible trams amongst people with a disability in Melbourne (Gini = 0.66) as 70% of the disabled population has access to only 22% of the accessible tram supply. In comparison, considering the total tram supply and the entire population, (Gini = 0.48) 70% of the population shares 40% of the tram supply. Hence, at this stage the provision of accessible tram services for people with a disability falls well below that of the general population. These results provide an insight into the current tram service inequality and can be used as a reference for future tram system investment. Further, the approach could be used to increase awareness of this matter and encourage an inclusive and sustainable public transport planning and development in both local and global contexts."

"Use-stage life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of the transition to an autonomous vehicle fleet: A System Dynamics approach Car Sharing; Bike; Autonomous Vehicles Autonomous vehicles are predicted to enter the commercial passenger vehicle market soon. Being a new technology, there is significant uncertainty surrounding its performance, adaptations by users, and influence on the wider transport and energy systems. In this uncertainty are several possibilities for autonomous vehicle technology to underdeliver on its promise of safety, efficiency, and flexibility; and, instead, become a net burden on society. The aim of this study is to develop insights into the medium- and long-term impacts of autonomous vehicles adoption on the use-stage greenhouse gas emissions. In the study, a System Dynamics approach was applied to develop a stock-and-flow model that simulates the technological intervention of replacing a conventional vehicle with an autonomous vehicle under scenarios related to vehicle adoption, induced vehicle demand, vehicle fleet turnover, vehicle ownership, vehicle efficiency, and the energy-supply greenhouse gas intensity. The results indicate that the internal-combustion-engine vehicle fuel efficiency and the electricity-supply greenhouse gas intensity have the largest influence on decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, but that the benefits can be negated by inefficient autonomous vehicles and induced demand. Based on these insights, recommendations to manufacturers include minimising energy consumption and adopting low-greenhouse gas vehicle technologies. Recommendations to governments include managing vehicle travel speeds, incentivising ride-sharing, and continuing support of renewable electricity supply. Shared recommendations include co-planning and preparing for data collection and reporting by autonomous vehicles, themselves, to support the facilitation of a low-greenhouse gas transition. The suggested future work focusses on developing the model, possibly in conjunction with other methods and tools, to support further exploration of other greenhouse gas emitting processes."

"The rise of ‘smart’ solutions in Africa: a review of the socio-environmental cost of the transportation and employment benefits of ride-hailing technology in Ghana Ghana; Urban Planning; Resource Curse Governments in Africa are licensing major global ride-hailing firms to launch operations in the continent. This is often presented as a refreshing development for the continent to leverage technology to address its twin problems of inefficient urban transport and rising youth unemployment. Interviews with ride-hailing adopters (drivers, riders, and car owners) and researchers in Ghana suggest, however, that whereas the technology is driving up the standards of road transport experience, the benefits are accessible to a select few (largely, the younger, highly educated and relatively high income-earning class). The lopsided power relations underlying the ride-hailing industry have also meant that the economic opportunities it avails disproportionately benefit a few powerful players (e.g. ride-hailing firms and car owners) while stimulating â€˜turf warsâ€™ among online and traditional taxi drivers; deepening existing gender inequalities in access to income-earning opportunities in the commercial passenger transport sector; encouraging unhealthy driving practices, shifts from shared public transport, and inundation of the roads with more private cars. While it will be imprecise to say that the private gains of ride-hailing outstrip the public costs and, therefore, the technology is detrimental to Ghanaâ€™s development, the considered evidence raises the need for sustained scrutiny of the hailing of technological interventions as though they are the magic bullets for socio-economic transformation in Africa. Overall, the paper argues that dismantling the power structures underlying Africaâ€™s urban challenges will require more than splashing â€˜smartâ€™ apps and other tech wizardries around. Indeed, the lessons from Ghanaâ€™s ride-hailing industry suggest that such exclusively technical solutions could easily take root and pattern after existing strictures of unjust power structures in ways that could exacerbate the social and environmental problems they are supposed to address."

Psaltoda Claripennis; Nanopillars; Bactericidal Activity Nanomaterials have emerged as the new weapon in the arsenal to fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR). While antibiotics have played a major role in combating infectious diseases, AMR presents a new challenge for sustainability in global health, food security and development. Inspired by nature, recent trending research has demonstrated that specific nanoscale surface patterns can rupture and kill bacteria on contact. Nano-engineered surfaces have demonstrated good capacity to prevent bacterial attachment and biofilm formation (the precursor to infection) and could be used as a strategic disinfectant for medically and industrially relevant materials. This opinion paper provides an overview of the role of nanotechnologies, specifically nanostructured surfaces, in aiding the development of infection-resistant surfaces."

"Factors confounding koala habitat mapping at multiple decision-making scales Koala; Animals; Retroviridae The Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal marsupial found throughout southeastern Australia. A high risk of extinction in some areas requires adherence to legislation mandating protection of high-quality habitat. The Koala primarily eats leaves of the Eucalyptus genus and wildlife managers are, in most cases, currently dependent on habitat maps depicting food resource availability derived from low-resolution regional-extent (~100,000 hectares) vegetation maps. These maps might not capture resource variability at planning extents (0.1â€“300 ha), or at resolutions where Koala ecology processes operate (5â€“50 ha). Consequently, potentially high-quality habitat may not be considered in planning decisions. Whether low-resolution habitat mapping adequately captures food resource variability is therefore relevant to map users at non-regional extents. We examined four different broad-scale low-resolution habitat maps within a small area (150 ha) in southeast Queensland and compared the classifications of each. Map units were generally ranked in the same hierarchical order; however, differences in methodologies meant that, between maps, some units varied widely in assigned habitat quality. Two maps were assessed using quantitative Queensland Herbarium data, and field data we collected. Assessment using overstorey species emphasised habitat quality differences between habitat map units better than the alternative whole-of-canopy method. Maps relying on interpretation of vegetation descriptions for habitat class definition sometimes overestimated food tree cover proportions and stakeholders need to be cognisant of these limitations. One method assigned Very Low Suitability to a 60-ha focal study site containing evidence of Koala use, and we strongly recommend that field validation should be an integral part of habitat management at these scales. We conclude that, rather than mapping approaches encompassing several habitat attributes within a single map, layered datasets, each with specific attributes, would provide greater utility for stakeholders by allowing them to use layers individually or in combination as required."

"Risk assessment of mega-city infrastructures related to land subsidence using improved trapezoidal FAHP China; Dewatering; Confined Aquifer This study presents an improved trapezoidal fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to assess the risk of mega-city infrastructures related to land subsidence. The trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to express the relative importance between assessment factors. A new questionnaire is proposed in this study to collect judgements from consulting experts. Both the original AHP and the trapezoidal FAHP with the new questionnaire are applied to assess the risk of infrastructures in relation to land subsidence in Shanghai. The risks assessed using the trapezoidal FAHP at locations with significant infrastructures are higher than those assessed using the original AHP. This indicates that the trapezoidal FAHP method with the new questionnaire can be used to effectively capture the high risks for significant industrial infrastructures related to land subsidence. Moreover, the obtained results were compared with the current land subsidence prevention zone, and it was observed that the existing land subsidence prevention zone in government management guidelines does not sufficiently consider the vulnerability of significant infrastructures."

"A novel approach for non‐invasive lung imaging and targeting lung immune cells Gold Nanoparticles; Nanocrystal; Radiation-Sensitizing Agents Despite developments in pulmonary radiotherapy, radiationâ€induced lung toxicity remains a problem. More sensitive lung imaging able to increase the accuracy of diagnosis and radiotherapy may help reduce this problem. Superâ€paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are used in imaging, but without further modification can cause unwanted toxicity and inflammation. Complex carbohydrate and polymerâ€based coatings have been used, but simpler compounds may provide additional benefits. Herein, we designed and generated superâ€paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles coated with the neutral natural dietary amino acid glycine (GSPIONs), to support nonâ€invasive lung imaging and determined particle biodistribution, as well as understanding the impact of the interaction of these nanoparticles with lung immune cells. These GSPIONs were characterized to be crystalline, colloidally stable, with a size of 12 Â± 5 nm and a hydrodynamic diameter of 84.19 Â± 18 nm. Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen (CHN) elemental analysis estimated approximately 20.2 Ã— 103 glycine molecules present per nanoparticle. We demonstrated that it is possible to determine the biodistribution of the GSPIONs in the lung using threeâ€dimensional (3D) ultraâ€short echo time magnetic resonance imaging. The GSPIONs were found to be taken up selectively by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in the lung. In addition, the GSPIONs did not cause changes to airway resistance or induce inflammatory cytokines. Alveolar macrophages and neutrophils are critical regulators of pulmonary inflammatory diseases, including allergies, infections, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Therefore, pulmonary Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging and preferential targeting of these lung resident cells by our nanoparticles offer precise imaging tools, which can be utilized to develop precision targeted radiotherapy as well as diagnostic tools for lung cancer, thereby having the potential to reduce the pulmonary complications of radiation."

"State-of-the-Art of Factors Affecting the Adoption of Automated Vehicles Car Sharing; Bike; Autonomous Vehicles Around 90% of accidents stem from human error. Disruptive technology, especially automated vehicles (AVs), can respond to the problems by, for instance, eradicating human error when driving, thus increasing energy efficiency due to the platoon effect, and potentially giving more space to human activities by decreasing parking space; hence, with the introduction of the autonomous vehicle, the public attitude towards its adoption needs to be understood to develop appropriate strategies and policies to leverage the potential benefits. There is a lack of a systematic and comprehensive literature review on adoption attitudes toward AVs that considers various interlinked factors such as road traffic environment changes, AV transition, and policy impacts. This study aims to synthesize past research regarding public acceptance attitude toward AVs. More specifically, the study investigates driverless technology and uncertainty, road traffic environment changes, policy impact, and findings from AV adoption modelling approaches, to understand public attitudes towards AVs. The study points out critical problems and future directions for analysis of AV impacts, such as the uncertainty on AVs adoption experiment, policy implementation and action plans, the uncertainty of AV-related infrastructure, and demand modelling."
"Macro-institutional conditions in Ghana and the challenges to HRM program development and implementation Subsidiaries; Innovation; Headquarters Multinational enterprises (MNEs) originating from advanced economies with operations in less developed host countries need to have a good understanding of the macro-institutional conditions of the host country. Given HRM practices are context-specific and embedded within the institutional and cultural settings of the host country, an exploratory qualitative study approach was employed to ascertain the host country's institutional dimensions (drivers) likely to undermine HRM program implementation in large local companies and in MNEs. Data were drawn from key stakeholder participants, including HR managers from MNE subsidiaries, domestic firms, and officials from key stakeholder institutions. The evidence points to six (6) dimensions of a less-developed host country's macro institutions that undermine firms' HRM advancement.

"Comparative analysis of the kinomes of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and their host Homo sapiens Toxoplasma Gondii; Protozoal Protein; Plasmodium Background: Novel antimalarials should be effective across all species of malaria parasites that infect humans, especially the two species that bear the most impact, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Protein kinases encoded by pathogens, as well as host kinases required for survival of intracellular pathogens, carry considerable potential as targets for antimalarial intervention (Adderley et al. Trends Parasitol 37:508â€“524, 2021; Wei et al. Cell Rep Med 2:100423, 2021). To date, no comprehensive P. vivax kinome assembly has been conducted; and the P. falciparum kinome, first assembled in 2004, requires an update. The present study, aimed to fill these gaps, utilises a recently published structurally-validated multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the human kinome (Modi et al. Sci Rep 9:19790, 2019). This MSA is used as a scaffold to assist the alignment of all protein kinase sequences from P. falciparum and P. vivax, and (where possible) their assignment to specific kinase groups/families. Results: We were able to assign six P. falciparum previously classified as OPK or â€˜orphansâ€™ (i.e. with no clear phylogenetic relation to any of the established ePK groups) to one of the aforementioned ePK groups. Direct phylogenetic comparison established that despite an overall high level of similarity between the P. falciparum and P. vivax kinomes, which will help in selecting targets for intervention, there are differences that may underlie the biological specificities of these species. Furthermore, we highlight a number of Plasmodium kinases that have a surprisingly high level of similarity with their human counterparts and therefore not well suited as targets for drug discovery. Conclusions: Direct comparison of the kinomes of Homo sapiens, P. falciparum and P. vivax sheds additional light on the previously documented divergence of many P. falciparum and P. vivax kinases from those of their human host. We provide the first direct kinome comparison between the phylogenetically distinct species of P. falciparum and P. vivax, illustrating the key similarities and differences which must be considered in the context of kinase-directed antimalarial drug discovery, and discuss the divergences and similarities between the human and Plasmodium kinomes to inform future searches for selective antimalarial intervention."

"Indium Oxides and Related Indium-based Photocatalysts for Water Treatment: Materials Studied, Photocatalytic Performance, and Special Highlights Indium Oxides; Gas Sensor; Sensing In2O3 is an emerging material in the photocatalysis research area, with a surge in the number of studies examining indium-based materials as photocatalysts in recent years. The materials of interest, herein, span the simple indium oxide in different polymorphs and morphologies, ternary, and even quaternary indium oxides, heterostructured systems, all in pure or doped forms. These indium-based materials offer advantages as photocatalysts compared with the conventional titanium dioxide-based photocatalysts. Highlights in the literature include reports of the ability of indium oxide to degrade difficult to decompose aqueous organic contaminants while also offering opportunities for visible light activation. These are exciting achievements in this field of research. The unique properties that these materials offer are uncovered, while giving insights as to how indium oxides and related indium-based materials can be used, in what capacity and the compositional requirements when matched with other semiconductors to achieve high-performing photocatalysts."

"Adsorption studies on removal of Pb(II) and Cd(II) ions using chitosan derived copoymeric blend Biosorbents; Congo Red; Adsorption Removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater is of crucial importance for an unpolluted environment and social wellbeing. The present study was designed to prepare a novel copolymeric blend as an efficient adsorbent using chitosan oligosaccharide for the removal of toxic heavy metals Pb and Cd. The ternary blend of Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) â€“ g â€“ glycidyl methacrylate copolymer (GM)/polypropylene glycol (PPG)/bentonite (Bent) was prepared and the change in morphology was ascertained by FTIR, XRD, TGA, and SEM studies. Using the prepared ternary blend, the adsorption of heavy metals was studied through batch mode to elucidate the changes in adsorption behavior. The removal percentage of lead was 89%, which was higher than cadmium (78%). The adsorption was well fitted with Freundlich isotherm (R2 for Pb: 0.9943 and Cd: 0.9990) and pseudo-second-order kinetics (R2 = Pb: 0.9994 and Cd: 0.9984) with Cmax 177 mg/g (for Pb(II)) and 158 mg/g (for Cd(II)) respectively. Different functional groups which were involved in the binding of the heavy metals were confirmed by SEM-EDAX and FTIR examination. Desorption studies were done using different eluents and the results exposed that the desorbing agent EDTA has great efficiency. The XRD patterns of metal adsorbed ternary blend showed the crystalline phases in their structures concluding the binding of metal ions and the renewal of an amorphous pattern of metal desorbed ternary blend revealed that the desorbed material is suitable for next cycle adsorption."

"Non-technical skills needed by cyber security graduates Information Security; Protocol Compliance; Computer Security Technical cyber-defence is often insufficient to protect a system as most cyber security incidences involve a human who takes an erroneous action or regrettable decision. To address the human factors, cyber security professionals need a range of technical and non-technical skills to enable them to effectively protect cyber-assets. There is research on the non-technical skills needed in ICT and engineering, but little specific to cyber security, and nothing in an Australian context. To support the job readiness of cyber security graduates it is necessary to identify the non-technical skills that are needed to be competitive in the modern cyber security market.To identify the non-technical skills needed or looked for by the Australian cyber security industry we ran an anonymous online survey. A range of demographic data was collected including gender, location, and role. Survey participants were asked about their use of non-technical skills, and the non-technical skills they seek when hiring junior staff. This paper reports on the most frequently sought after non-technical skills. A brief analysis indicates that some of the most sought after non-technical skills are neither explicitly taught nor explicitly assessed in most Master of Cyber Security degrees in Australia.With more and more Australian universities offering cyber security degrees, the findings of the survey can be used to inform cyber security curriculum design."
"Findings from the Kids in Communities Study (KiCS): A mixed methods study examining community-level influences on early childhood development Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians There is increasing international interest in place-based approaches to improve early childhood development (ECD) outcomes. The available data and evidence are limited and precludes well informed policy and practice change. Developing the evidence-base for community-level effects on ECD is one way to facilitate more informed and targeted community action. This paper presents overall final findings from the Kids in Communities Study (KiCS), an Australian mixed methods investigation into community-level effects on ECD in five domains of influenceâ€“physical, social, governance, service, and sociodemographic. Twenty five local communities (suburbs) across Australia were selected based on â€˜diagonality typeâ€™ i.e. whether they performed better (off-diagonal positive), worse (off-diagonal negative), or â€˜as expectedâ€™ (on-diagonal) on the Australian Early Development Census (AEDC) relative to their socioeconomic profile. The approach was designed to determine replicable and modifiable factors that were separate to socioeconomic status. Between 2015â€“2017, stakeholder interviews (n = 146), parent and service provider focus groups (n = 51), and existing socio-economic and early childhood education and care administrative data were collected. Qualitative and quantitative data analyses were undertaken to understand differences between 14 paired disadvantaged local communities (i.e. on versus off-diagonal). Further analysis of qualitative data elicited important factors for all 25 local communities. From this, we developed a draft set of â€˜Foundational Community Factorsâ€™ (FCFs); these are the factors that lay the foundations of a good community for young children."
"Current status of and future opportunities for digital agriculture in Australia Energy Transition; Innovation System; Sustainability In Australia, digital agriculture is considered immature and its adoption ad hoc, despite a relatively advanced technology innovation sector. In this review, we focus on the technical, governance and social factors of digital adoption that have created a disconnect between technology development and the end user community (farmers and their advisors). Using examples that reflect both successes and barriers in Australian agriculture, we first explore the current enabling technologies and processes, and then we highlight some of the key socio-technical factors that explain why digital agriculture is immature and ad hoc. Pronounced issues include fragmentation of the innovation system (and digital tools), and a lack of enabling legislation and policy to support technology deployment. To overcome such issues and increase adoption, clear value propositions for change are necessary. These value propositions are influenced by the perceptions and aspirations of individuals, the delivery of digitally-enabled processes and the supporting legislative, policy and educational structures, better use/conversion of data generated through technology applications to knowledge for supporting decision making, and the suitability of the technology. Agronomists and early adopter farmers will play a significant role in closing the technology-end user gap, and will need support and training from technology service providers, government bodies and peer-networks. Ultimately, practice change will only be achieved through mutual understanding, ownership and trust. This will occur when farmers and their advisors are an integral part of the entire digital innovation system."

"Investigating Space Requirements in Schools Victoria has a long reputation as Australia?s Education State.  It is imperative that the Victorian Department of Education and Training (DET) to support high quality, contemporary Victorian schools that can improve and grow positive outcomes for Victorian students. 
With recent population and density increases, current and emerging pedagogy, constraints on land and capital, changing community expectations, and the emergence of fit-for-purpose space, there is a need for alternative school building models. These alternative models include vertical builds, multi campuses, and `cluster? schools (multiple schools in the one location).
DET and the Victoria School Building Authority (VSBA) want a better understanding of how modern design principles and international best practice could be deployed to support provision planning for new school capacity in established areas. Research is required to determine the opportunities and / or constraints of alternative school building models.
Our solution:
KPMG will create a research report to better inform the Department and relevant stakeholders as to how it can deliver school infrastructure to a growing population whilst maintaining and continually improving pedagogical outcomes, learning and teaching experience and sustainable, effective design within the constraints and practicalities of building in high density suburbs and cities.
We have developed a holistic approach and methodology that seeks to incorporate the expertise of our incredible team and yours, as well as leverage research by our project partners at A4LE and RMIT University. As part of our research methodology we will conduct in-depth exploratory research, and will lead case study development with empirical research and extensive consultation. This will include state wide, national and international examples, encompassing well established to recent implementation of these principles. "

"Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling in the Circular Economy: A Review Lithium-ion Batteries; Nickel Metal Hydride Batteries; Leaching Lithium-ion batteries have become a crucial part of the energy supply chain for transportation (in electric vehicles) and renewable energy storage systems. Recycling is considered one of the most effective ways for recovering the materials for spent LIB streams and circulating the material in the critical supply chain. However, few review articles have been published in the research domain of recycling and the circular economy, with most mainly focusing on either recycling methods or the challenges and opportunities in the circular economy for spent LIBs. This paper reviewed 93 articles (66 original research articles and 27 review articles) identified in the Web of Science core collection database. The study showed that publications in the area are increasing exponentially, with many focusing on recycling and recovery-related issues; policy and regulatory affairs received less attention than recycling. Most of the studies were experiments followed by evaluation and plan-ning (as per the categorization made). Pre-treatment processes were widely discussed, which is a critical part of hydrometallurgy and direct physical recycling (DPR). DPR is a promising recycling technique that requires further attention. Some of the issues that require further consideration in-clude a techno-economic assessment of the recycling process, safe reverse logistics, a global EV assessment revealing material recovery potential, and a lifecycle assessment of experiments processes (both in the hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes). Furthermore, the application of the circular business model and associated stakeholdersâ€™ engagement, clear and definitive policy guidelines, extended producer responsibility implications, and material tracking, and identification deserve further focus. This study presents several future research directions that would be useful for academics and policymakers taking necessary steps such as product design, integrated recycling techniques, intra-industry stakeholder cooperation, business model development, techno-economic analysis, and others towards achieving a circular economy in the LIB value chain."

"Predicting Mobility as a Service (MaaS) use for different trip categories: An artificial neural network analysis Car Sharing; Bike; Autonomous Vehicles Mobility as a Service (MaaS) has gained popularity as a means of sustainable urban transport which makes the understanding of MaaS use critical for its design and promotion. Studies have contributed to the growing understanding of MaaS, its design features, and consumersâ€™ willingness to pay for MaaS in general, without recourse to the differences in traveling for work, social and general purposes. This paper develops and tests models to predict MaaS use by applying artificial neural network analysis, following the cross industry standard process and data mining framework. It also estimates separate models for social, general, and work trips, using 33 input variables reflecting network externality, transaction cost, behaviour, institutional, environmental concern, personal travel, and socio-economic factors. Data are collected from a survey of 331 Australians. The study reveals different sets of socio-economic factors, the impact of Covid-19, and personal travel factors as key predictors of MaaS use for general, social, and work trips with an average prediction accuracy of 68%, 68%, and 75% respectively. The findings can be used to inform strategies and policies on how to attract a user base with respect to socio-economic and personal travel factors for promoting MaaS use."

"Low-Cost Portable Inhalation Therapy Platform for Needle-Free DNA-Based Influenza Vaccination The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that influenza causes between 3 and 5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000?500,000 deaths annually.1 In Australia, influenza is associated with 1,500?2,500 deaths annually. In addition to loss of life, influenza outbreaks represent a significant healthcare burden and cost to both industry and individuals. Due to needle aversion, less than ideal efficacy and an inability to safely or effectively vaccinate some groups of patients (immunocompromised individuals), there is considerable need to investigate alternative influenza vaccine strategies. The proposed research aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost handheld nebulisation platform for efficient pulmonary influenza vaccination we have developed, which could significantly transform strategies for effective global vaccination."
"Oxidative treatment of bisphenol A in municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate using Ferrate(VI) Ferrate Ion; Disinfection; Oxidation Reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) resulting from the municipal wastewater recycling processes poses significant environmental and health risks as it contains significant concentrations of harmful compounds, including phenolic chemicals including bisphenol A (BPA). In this study, the effect of ferrate(VI) (or Fe(VI)) oxidation on the degradation of BPA (50 Î¼g L-1) in a typical ROC matrix was investigated. The influence of process variables including the [Fe(VI)]/[BPA] ratios (7-50), initial pH (5.0-8.0) and reaction temperature (15-25 Â°C) was studied. Fe(VI) was found to be highly effective in degrading BPA in the complex ROC matrix with various operating conditions. At 25 Â°C, over 90% degradation of BPA was achieved at the [Fe(VI)]/[BPA] ratio of 50, and an initial pH of the ROC at 8.0 after 90 min of reaction. Under such conditions, the reduction in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was found to be 34% accompanied by a 95% reduction in UV254 absorbance (initial value 0.750 cm-1) with 96.4% SUVA reduction. Additionally, the residual concentration of Fe(III) at pH 8.0 was the lowest compared to other pH conditions at a fixed [Fe(VI)]/[BPA] ratio of 50. Fluorescence regional integration (FRI) analyses revealed that Fe(VI) preferentially react with fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like compounds, and aromatic protein II in the ROC. This indicated Fe(VI) effectively breaking down electron-rich moieties groups including phenols and other organics in ROC. The apparent second-order rate constant (kapp) for BPA degradation was determined to be 2.27 Ã— 102 M-1 s-1 at pH 8.0 at a [Fe(VI)]/[BPA] ratio of 50, and the value of reaction rate constant increased proportionally with increasing molar ratio at the range studied. The effectiveness of Fe(VI) in the degradation of BPA in the ROC demonstrates the potential of using Fe(VI) as an efficient oxidant to remediate the micropollutants present in water and wastewater."

"Whole of meat supply chain waste mapping and interventions – Phase 1 The project will quantify meat waste generation in Australian meat supply chains, identify the root causes
of waste generation, and propose solutions that can be adopted by industry. It will fill significant gaps in
data about the volumes and costs of meat waste, to inform the co-development of waste reduction
opportunities with industry and government partners. It is Phase 1 of a larger 3-phased project, focusing
on the upstream production stages (farm to retail door) for one meat product (beef). Subsequent phases
will expand into other meat types (lamb, pork, chicken) and the downstream consumption stages,
informed by another FFW CRC project “Consumer fridge behaviour and waste reduction of red meat”. The
benefits to the red meat industry from this Phase 1 project will be identification of large cost saving
opportunities for actors in the supply chain from meat waste solutions, a workforce more skilled in
resource efficiency, and increased collaboration and transparency along the supply chain to unlock
innovation. The benefits for society will be reductions in the environmental impacts of meat products
(particularly GHG emissions), helping maintain the meat industry’s social licence to operate and its longterm capacity for it to contribute to Australia’s economy.

"Cyber Attacks Detection from Smart City Applications Using Artificial Neural Network Intrusion Detection System; Network Security; Denial-Of-Service Attack Recently, the widespread deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications has contributed to the development of smart cities, which utilise smart applications to maximize operational efficiency, and thereby the quality of services and the wellbeing of people. In this paper, we propose an attack and anomaly detection technique based on machine learning algorithms to mitigate IoT cybersecurity threats in a smart city. Notably, while there are many different machine learning (ML) algorithms, including computationally expensive deep learning network, we opted for using artificial neural network (ANN) since an ANN can provide a simple and computationally faster architecture as needed for smart city operations. A widely used performance metrics, namely, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are utilized to evaluate the model. Experiment results with the recent attack dataset demonstrate that the proposed technique can effectively identify the cyber attacks and outperform results reported in an existing work."

"Presence and characterization of microplastics in fish of commercial importance from the Biobío region in central Chile Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter In this study we have identified and characterized microplastic particles (MPs) found in six fish species of commercial importance in central Chile. The fish species belong to different trophic levels and were obtained from the oceanic and coastal habitats. To analyze MPs, the fish gastrointestinal content was extracted, analyzed and characterized using a microscopy equipped with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The MPs found in fish samples were mainly constituted by red microfibers (70â€“100%) with sizes ranging between 176 and 2842 Î¼m. Polyester, polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were identified as the prevalent polymers detected. The coastal species showed the presence of microfibers with a higher size and abundance (71%) compared to oceanic species (29%), suggesting there is a greater exposure risk. These findings are consistent with results found in other investigations worldwide. However, further research is still needed to accurately establish the potential exposure risk for the public consuming these fish and the impact of MPs in the Chilean fishery activities."

"The social location of harm from others’ drinking in 10 societies Alcohol Consumption; Vodka; Ethanol Aims: Survey data from 10 diverse countries were used to analyse the social location of harms from othersâ€™ drinking: which segments of the population are more likely to be adversely affected by such harm, and how does this differ between societies?. Methods: General-population surveys in Australia, Chile, India, Laos, New Zealand, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United States and Vietnam, with a primary focus on the social location of the harmed person by gender, age groups, rural/urban residence and drinking status. Harms from known drinkers were analysed separately from harms from strangers. Results: In all sites, risky or moderate drinkers were more likely than abstainers to report harm from the drinking of known drinkers, with risky drinkers the most likely to report harm. This was also generally true for harm from strangersâ€™ drinking, although the patterns were more mixed in Vietnam and Thailand. Harm from strangersâ€™ drinking was more often reported by males, while gender disparity in harm from known drinkers varied between sites. Younger adults were more likely to experience harm both from known drinkers and from strangers in some, but not all, societies. Only a few sites showed significant urban/rural differences, with disparities varying in direction. In multivariate analyses, most relationships remained, although some were no longer significant. Conclusion: The social location of harms from othersâ€™ drinking, whether known or a stranger, varies considerably between societies. One near-commonality among the societies is that those who are themselves risky drinkers are more likely to suffer harm from othersâ€™ drinking."

"Bridging the Gap Between Industry and Academia: The Case of Indonesia Entrepreneurial University; Academic Entrepreneurship; Innovation As a country, Indonesia is becoming increasingly urbanized and has a large proportion of its population under the age of 25 years, at slightly over 100 million. Developing this fairly large proportion of its population from a human capital perspective is essential for the future of the country. Currently there is a 40% gap between supply and demand; and is expected to grow to 70% by 2025. Building an educational platform for effective learning and skills formation is urgently needed. This entry presents the outcomes of a case study aimed at understanding the disconnects between academia, industry and government in the context of Indonesiaâ€™s built environment programs. In particular, the architecture profession and architectural education have been considered as one of several built environment programs under pressure to change. Built environment suite of programs have various disciplinary underpinnings: architecture, building, engineering, planning, quantity surveying, project management and others such as interior design and transportation engineering. The case study focuses on the results of a workshop in Indonesia, where various stakeholders responsible for city planning and building came together to determine the current challenges and seek solutions. The entry delves into the education of the architecture profession in Indonesia and presents the results of the workshop with some recommendations for the future. The results show that the various sectors and stakeholders are prepared to work collaboratively and support joint ownership of meeting curricular outcomes."

"Non-coding RNAs in legumes: Their emerging roles in regulating biotic/abiotic stress responses and plant growth and development Argonaute Proteins; Gene; Nicotiana Benthamiana Noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interference RNAs (siRNAs), circular RNA (circRNA), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), control gene expression at the transcription, post-transcription, and translation levels. Apart from protein-coding genes, accumulating evidence supports ncRNAs playing a critical role in shaping plant growth and development and biotic and abiotic stress responses in various species, including legume crops. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) interact with DNA, RNA, and proteins, modulating their target genes. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling these cellular processes are not well understood. Here, we discuss the features of various ncRNAs, including their emerging role in contributing to biotic/abiotic stress response and plant growth and development, in addition to the molecular mechanisms involved, focusing on legume crops. Unravelling the underlying molecular mechanisms and functional implications of ncRNAs will enhance our understanding of the coordinated regulation of plant defences against various biotic and abiotic stresses and for key growth and development processes to better design various legume crops for global food security."

"Experts’ Perceptions of the Management and Minimisation of Waste in the Australian Construction Industry Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management Effective waste management has become a crucial factor in Australia because, from 1996 to 2015, the population increased by 28%, while Australiaâ€™s annual waste increased by 170%. In the period 2018â€“2019, Australia generated 27 Mt of construction demolition waste (44% of all waste). Although 76% of this waste is recycled, there has been a 61% increase in the rate of waste since 2006â€“2007. Therefore, minimising waste and prioritising waste management are necessary to build a circular economy. This study aims to identify the current waste minimisation perceptions in the Australian construction industry. A semi-structured interview was conducted with 50 industry experts focusing on four sectors (design/planning, building information modelling (BIM), material logistics, and prefabrication). The data were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively (Severity index). The result disclosed that the designers are the first contributor to waste minimisation, followed by the material suppliers/manufacturers. It is revealed that subjective attitude and the personal reluctance to exercise waste mitigation strategies are crucial. The outcome also indicated that BIM has the potential to minimise waste significantly. Overall, 15 key points were highlighted to consider for waste minimisation, and a conceptual framework was proposed. Therefore, identifying waste managementâ€™s current practices and the responsibility of industry personnel will help minimise waste and bring sustainable development."
"Performance of chemically resistant polyurea reverse osmosis membrane in the treatment of highly alkaline industrial wastewater containing sodium aluminate Nanofiltration Membranes; Thin Film Composite Membranes; Membrane The goal of the present study is to treat industrial wastewater containing sodium aluminate using a chemically inert polyurea (PU) based thin film composite (TFC) reverse osmosis (RO) membrane to promote water reclamation and zero liquid discharge (ZLD). Pretreatment was carried out to reduce the pH of the effluent from 12.5 to 7.1. The TFC RO membrane was fabricated by coating PU on Polyethersulfone (PES) substrate by interfacial polymerization (IP). The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the membrane were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The indigenously synthesized membrane was effective in the removal of total dissolved solids (TDS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), colour and electrical conductivity. The experiments were conducted by varying the feed composition of the wastewater. The maximum water recovery and flux were found to be 74% and 73.9 L/m2.h. RO process using PU membrane exhibited significant potential for cost effective, safe and pollution-free treatment of sodium aluminate industrial effluent."

"Trial of liquid biosolids injection at South East Water’s
Longwarry water recycling plant (Administered by University of Newcastle). Building on previous collaborative research conducted in the field of
groundwater, and discussions arising between the University and RMIT initiated
at a forum on biosolids liquid injection in 2019, the University proposes to work
with the RMIT to conduct a targeted research project to investigate the
groundwater quality effects and future learnings from a trial of liquid biosolids
injection at South East Water’s Longwarry water recycling plant.
Through targeted data analysis, the project will seek to address two outstanding
questions:
1. What are the major groundwater quality effects of liquid injection of biosolids
at the Longwarry Water Recycling Plant, and how have these developed since
the trial in 2018?
2. What are the learnings which can be gained from this trial for future biosolids
liquid injection schemes – such as relevant water quality indicators to monitor
and assess?
To address these questions, RMIT will conduct analysis of data collected at a
series of purpose-constructed piezometers at the Longwarry Water Recycling
Plant. These samples have been collected and analysed since December 2018
and indicate changes in the concentrations of nutrients, metals and other key
groundwater characteristics following the liquid injection trial.
RMIT will (with advice from the University) analyse these data using a range of
statistical, analytical and graphical techniques in order to understand the main
controls responsible for changes in groundwater quality at the site (both factors
related to the liquid injection trial and other un-related factors).
These data and interpretations will be summarised in a report which will be
drafted for review by South East Water, and then delivered at the conclusion of
the project."

"Bio-inspired sustainable and durable superhydrophobic materials: From nature to market Hydrophobicity; Wetting Transition; Fabrication Nature has endowed many of its living systems with functional structures with highly tuned wettability. Inspired by nature, scientists began to mimic these natural templates and as a result a wide spectrum of biomimetic superhydrophobic surfaces are fabricated. Fluorinated synthetic materials are currently used on an industrial scale to produce superhydrophobic surfaces. The negative impact of fluorinated substances on human health together with growing environmental concerns has prompted researchers to adopt safer routes with minimal use of fluorinated compounds. This has led to increased focus on bio-inspired studies. Current research on the fabrication and characterisation of superhydrophobic materials aims to use fluorine-free reagents such as siloxane polymers and long-chain fatty acids. In this context, this review attempts to highlight the recent progress in fluorine-free superhydrophobic surfaces and important features of their design, synthesis and fabrication that would potentially broaden their application in various fields. This review also aims to provide insights into technical breakthroughs in manufacturing of these materials with the aid of easy-to-understand illustrations. The current challenges regarding scale up, industrial production and marketing of these novel and natural polymer based superhydrophobic materials are also highlighted."
"Using a Risk-based Approach for Derivation of Water Quality Guidelines for Sulphate Ceriodaphnia Dubia; Daphnia Magna; Metals Sulphate is a major salt component in acid mine drainage and a crucial ecological concern in most coal and gold mining regions, globally. However, there remains a paucity of data on sulphate salinity toxicity on freshwater taxa. In this study, we hypothesised sensitivity differences for five freshwater species (Adenophlebia auriculata, Burnupia stenochorias, Caridina nilotica, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Oreochromis mossambicus) to increasing sulphate salinity concentrations after 240 h of exposure. Species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) were used to rank the sensitivity of tested species to the inorganic sulphate salts, which included magnesium sulphate (MgSO4), sodium sulphate (Na2SO4), and calcium sulphate (CaSO4) as models of mining salinisation in South Africa. The SSDs were also used to estimate appropriate protective concentrations of the salts for the tested species. Sensitivity differences were measured and Na2SO4 was the most toxic of the tested salts. A concentration of 0.020 g/L Na2SO4, 0.055 g/L CaSO4, and 0.108 g/L MgSO4 or a combined salts limit of 0.067 g/L would be protective of 95% of the populations of the five species tested; these all suggest that the 0.25 g/L compliance limit for South Africa is insufficient. Future studies should incorporate more species in the SSD approach to be coupled by field validations to further improve the ecological relevance of these findings."

"Crowdsourcing-based framework for teaching quality evaluation and feedback using linguistic 2-tuple Aggregation Operators; Pythagorean; Fuzzy Set Crowdsourcing is widely used in various fields to collect goods and services from large participants. Evaluating teaching quality by collecting feedback from experts or students after class is not only delayed but also not accurate. In this paper, we present a crowdsourcing-based framework to evaluate teaching quality in the classroom using a weighted average operator to aggregate information from studentsâ€™ questionnaires described by linguistic 2-tuple terms. Then we define crowd grade based on similarity degree to distinguish contribution from different students and minimize the abnormal studentsâ€™ impact on the evaluation. The crowd grade would be updated at the end of each feedback so it can guarantee the evaluation accurately. Moreover, a simulated case is shown to illustrate how to apply this framework to assess teaching quality in the classroom. Finally, we developed a prototype and carried out some experiments on a series of real questionnaires and two sets of modified data. The results show that teachers can locate the weak points of teaching and furthermore to identify the abnormal students to improve the teaching quality. Meanwhile, our approach provides a strong tolerance for the abnormal student to make the evaluation more accurate."

"Recent advances in heterogeneous catalyst design for biorefining Biomass; Levulinic Acids; Ethyl Levulinate Biorefineries are a new concept in chemical manufacturing in which naturally occurring, sustainable biomass resources such as forestry and agricultural waste are converted to diverse fuel and chemical product streams, akin to the processing of non-renewable fossil fuels by petrochemical refineries. Biomass derived from waste agricultural and forestry materials or non-food crops offers the most easily implemented and economical solutions for transportation fuels, and the only nonpetroleum route to organic molecules for the manufacture of bulk, fine, and speciality chemicals necessary to secure the future needs of society. The successful implementation of biorefineries can address concerns over dwindling oil reserves, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel sources and associated climate change, and will be underpinned by catalytic processes to facilitate the co-production of platform chemicals and biofuels. Catalysis is a central theme in sustainable chemistry, lowering energy and resource requirements while minimising waste production. In contrast to fossil-derived crude oil, which has low oxygen content, the high oxygen and water content of biomass feedstocks presents challenges for their utilisation and requires innovations in catalyst and process design for the selective conversion of these hydrophilic, bulky feedstocks into fuels or high-value chemicals. This article highlights how methods to control porosity, solid acid and base character, and surface hydrophobicity are essential components of a toolkit for the design of heterogeneous catalysts for biomass processing."

"The economic dynamics and population change of Australia’s regional cities Regional Development; Leadership; Governance Arrangement Key points This analysis is based on data from the 2011 and 2016 censuses, and does not take into account the redistributions and changes that may have occurred with COVID-19. This report can be seen as providing a baseline for subsequent analysis of the changes that have occurred and continue to occur, identifying the trends and conditions across regional Australiaâ€™s urban centres prior to 2020. Populations in regional urban centres are growing overallâ€”however, this growth is differentiated. Regional urban centre population growth is associated with proximity to major cities, and to coastal locations. Regional urban centre population decline is associated with remoteness and exposure to the resource economy. Capital cities are the main source of migration to regional urban centres, principally coastal and satellite centres with regional-to-regional-centre migration highly self-contained. International migration follows similar distribution. Commuting between regional centres and proximate capital cities increased over 2011â€“2016, indicating increased peri-metropolitan dependency on metropolitan interactions. Employment growth is associated with population growth, particularly for the larger metropolitan satellite and coastal regional citiesâ€”however, this is also associated with lower wage growth due to the employment mix. Health, community service, construction, hospitality and accommodation increased their share of regional employment. Industries associated with agglomeration economies are concentrating in fewer urban centres, while those associated with population services are becoming more dispersed. National economic growth factors appear to expert greater influence on employment growth in regional urban centres, while industry factors exert very limited influence. Regional effects exert greater influence than industry effects, although these are unevenly distributed. In 135 of 198 cases, a regional urban centre exhibits employment growth along with its surrounding functional economic region. For 33 regional urban centres there is positive divergence, while for 25 there is negative divergence. Four regional urban centres are declining within a declining functional economic region. Factors associated with stronger employment growth include employment factors, industry factors (especially those dependent on population growth), while income growth was less associated with employment growth. Population change exerted a strong influence on employment growth, as did human capital factors. Housing market (i.e. price) growth is strongly associated with population growth, while locational factors exhibited low associations. Cluster analysis identified nine distinctive regional urban centre groups: metro-satellites; large regional cities; medium growth cities; regional service centres; ageing population centres; agricultural centres; mining centres; industrial centres, and northern Queensland centres. Policy development should consider the following: Policy and planning measures to address the phenomenon of growth in metropolitan satellite regional urban centres, and the need to ensure coherent population, housing and employment distribution and linkages. Coordinated economic and social development approaches to emerging low-income service economies in coastal regional urban centres. Long-term transition planning to address resource-dependent regional urban centres facing cyclical economic changes based on the labour intensity of construction relative to ongoing economic activity. Opportunities and mechanisms to leverage high-wage economic development from existing regional city industry clusters. Opportunities and mechanisms for regional spatial coordination of fiscal policy to optimise development of high-wage employment in suitable regional urban centres. The study Purpose The contribution of regional urban centres to Australiaâ€™s economic and population growth has been a topic of growing policy interest in the past two decades, as a result of rapid growth in the major cities and concerns for parts of regional Australia that have experienced population decline. Associated with these trends is the distribution of economic activity and employmentâ€”particularly as traditional regional strengths such as agriculture, manufacturing and mining have declined as sources of employment in recent decades. Over the same period, metropolitan areas have prospered because of concentrations of high-skill, high-wage knowledge work, indicating diverging regional fortunes as a result of wider economic trends. The purpose of this research is to investigate patterns and dynamics of population, migration and economic change in Australian regional urban centres 2011â€“2016. The research is principally an empirically focused investigation identifying patterns and dynamic processes of regional change using advanced spatial analytical techniques, but provides an information base that will support future policy development efforts. Inquiry This research is part of a wider AHURI Inquiry into population growth in Australiaâ€™s smaller cities. The Inquiry asks two overarching questions: First, what is the capacity of Australiaâ€™s smaller cities to assist in managing national population growth, including international and national migration? Second, which policy instruments and programs are most likely to redirect population movements to these locations? Study This research investigates two overarching questions related to the Inquiry: How can we differentiate Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres according to economic profile, population trajectory, industry structure and geography? What are the current mobility and settlement patterns of migrants, including those arriving from other parts of Australia and from other nations, across these smaller cities? Three further research questions are posed by this project: 1. How can a typology of smaller cities assist to understand their role in regional, state and national economies? 2. How are Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres differentiated in terms of economic profile, population trajectory and industry structure? 3. What demographic, economic and spatial factors are associated with economic and population growth, and what attributes are associated with better economic performance of regional urban centres? Approach and methods For Research question 1: the project undertakes longitudinal measures of social, demographic and industry change in regional cities 2011â€“2016 using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census data. Next, flow analysis and mapping of migration is applied to identify key migration patterns. Migration flows are used to construct migration regions via modularity analysis. Similar techniques are used to identify journey to work flows from which functional economic regions are constructed. Shift share of employment change and location quotient analysis of employment is used to understand economic change and industry structure. For Research question 2, to understand how Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres are differentiated the project applies hierarchical cluster and discriminant analysis to construct a typology of regional urban centres. This is based on a combination of economic, demographic and geographic factors. These are compiled into summary data and descriptive explanations. For Research question 3: the study applies structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify the relationships between economic, social and demographic factors affecting population change and economic growth in regional urban centres. Key findings Differentiating Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres are heterogeneous in terms of size, location within the Australian continent and settlement structures, level of employment, industrial mix and degree of interaction with regional, metropolitan, national and international economic processes and dynamics. In 2016, there were 198 Australian regional urban centres that had populations greater than 5,000 residents. Most are experiencing population growth. However this growth is differentiated across a range of factors, including: the existing size of the centre location relative to the coast location relative to an existing major capital city. A small number of regional urban centres are experiencing population decline. These centres are largely associated with the resource economy. They are typically positioned in remote locations in Australia. Migration Migration is a major factor in population change within regional urban centres. Migration patterns are clearly structured at the regional scale, with distinct geographies of intra-regional movement that include discernible levels of self-containment. There is a sizeable phenomenon of major city to regional urban centre migration, especially in the south-east of Australia. Beyond the major metropolitan zones, there are larger internally connected migration regions, which often involving movement between adjacent regional urban centres. Some regional urban centres lose and receive populations across long distances. For example, the Northern Territory (NT) operates as a single migration region, partly because of its relatively small population and large scaleâ€”although the volumes of movement are relatively small."

"Financial inclusion and poverty: Micro-level evidence from Nigeria Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion In this chapter, the authors use data from the 2016 Financial Inclusion Insights (FII) program for Nigeria to present new evidence on the effects of financial inclusion on household poverty. The authors add to the discourse on the association between financial inclusion and poverty by examining alternative approaches to measuring both financial inclusion and poverty. The chapter demonstrates that an increase in multi-dimensional financial inclusion, reflecting access to banks, access to credit and access to insurance, is associated with a decline in poverty. Further analysis by the authors show that among the components of financial inclusion, access to a checking, savings or fixed deposit account is more important than access to credit and insurance in reducing poverty."

"Structural and electrochemical characterization of vanadium-excess Li3V2(PO4)3-LiVOPO4/C composite cathode material synthesized by sol–gel method Carbon; Electrochemical Properties; Electrodes To improve capacity and electrochemical performance of the cathode of Li-ion batteries, non-stoichiometric, vanadium-excess (V-excess) Li3V2(PO4)3-LiVOPO4/C (LVP-LVOP/C) composite cathode materials are synthesized by a single-step citric acid assisted solâ€“gel method and sintered at temperatures (300â€“900 Â°C). X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope results indicate that major Li3V2(PO4)3 and minor LiVOPO4 phases coexist and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results also show that the valance state of vanadium is + 4 and + 3. The sample sintered at 800 Â°C shows the best electrochemical performance with the highest discharge capacity of 140 mAh gâˆ’1 at 0.2 C, higher than the theoretical capacity of Li3V2(PO4)3 in the voltage range 2.8â€“4.3 V. The composite material displays remarkably improved stability exhibiting reversible capacity of 130, 115, and 108â€¯mAhâ€¯gâˆ’1â€¯after 300, 500, and 1000 cycles at the rate of 0.3 C, 0.5 C, and 1 C, respectively. Additionally, the composite LVP-LVOP/C shows superior rate performance at various current densities from 0.2 to 10 C. Our study reveals that the novel composite material considerably enhances electrochemical performance, electronic conductivity, Li-ion diffusion, and contribution of LiVOPO4 to capacity by accommodating extra Li-ions to enhance capacity. The results demonstrate that the study is highly promising for the development of V-excess cathodes as V-excess composite materials exhibit better performance than pure phase Li3V2(PO4)3.

"Soil carbon density can increase when Australian savanna is converted to pasture, but may not change under intense cropping systems Soil Organic Carbon; China; Carbon Sinks Savanna regions are increasingly developed for agriculture to support population growth, food demand and export economies. This is driving interest in the conversion of natural savanna to cattle grazed pastures or horticultural crops in Northern Australia. Savanna clearing leads to aboveground carbon (C) loss but impacts below-ground are less certain as studies have focused on high rainfall regions, low reactive clay soils and shallow depths of 0.3 m or less. To examine impact of land use change (LUC) in Northern Australia, we sampled the upper 1.0 m soil profile of: 1) savanna woodlands, 2) old and young C4 perennial cattle grazed pastures and 3) old and young, melon-sorghum rotation fields. Soil C concentrations and soil bulk density in the upper 0.3 m were significantly greater in cattle grazed pastures than savanna woodland, such that savanna to pasture LUC significantly increased soil C density from 30.2 Â± 1.5â€“43.4 Â± 3.0 Mg C ha-1 over 28 years. Soil bulk density in the upper 0.7 m of savanna woodland was significantly less than that in the melon-sorghum rotations. In contrast, soil C concentrations below 0.5 m were significantly greater in the savanna woodland than in the 3 y.o. melon-sorghum rotation fields. There was no significant difference in soil C density between savanna woodland and 12 y.o. melon-sorghum rotations. This may relate to the beneficial effects of ploughing in sorghum as a green manure, or simply that the decrease in soil C concentration was offset by increased soil C density in the upper layers of soil where most C is located. In contrast, conversion of savanna to cattle grazed pasture sites is equivalent to a soil sequestration rate of 0.34 Mg C ha-1 y-1, approximately 50% of the observed net ecosystem productivity estimated using eddy covariance methods. Changing the depth to which soil C density was estimated changed significant differences amongst land-use systems. Whereas, estimating soil C density using a â€˜fixed depthâ€™ or â€˜equivalent massâ€™ method did not change the statistical significance. There is an increasing focus on the potential of soil carbon sequestration especially in north Australia and understanding potential change and impact of accounting methods is essential for meaningful policy development. Policy settings to maintain, or improve, soil C storage and soil health may contradict agricultural development goals."

"Megahertz pulse trains enable multi-hit serial femtosecond crystallography experiments at X-ray free electron lasers X-Ray Laser; Crystallography; Serials The European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) and Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) II are extremely intense sources of X-rays capable of generating Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SFX) data at megahertz (MHz) repetition rates. Previous work has shown that it is possible to use consecutive X-ray pulses to collect diffraction patterns from individual crystals. Here, we exploit the MHz pulse structure of the European XFEL to obtain two complete datasets from the same lysozyme crystal, first hit and the second hit, before it exits the beam. The two datasets, separated by <1 Âµs, yield up to 2.1 Ã… resolution structures. Comparisons between the two structures reveal no indications of radiation damage or significant changes within the active site, consistent with the calculated dose estimates. This demonstrates MHz SFX can be used as a tool for tracking sub-microsecond structural changes in individual single crystals, a technique we refer to as multi-hit SFX."

"Microplastics and pollutants in biosolids have contaminated agricultural soils: An analytical study and a proposal to cease the use of biosolids in farmlands and utilise them in sustainable bricks Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Treated waste-water sludge (biosolids) are frequently recycled in agricultural lands; however, this practice has polluted soils with microplastics (MPs), nanoplastics (NPs), synthetics, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals and engineered nanoparticles. This study analyses many of the significant research outcomes in this area and proposes the urgent reduction of biosolids recycling in farmlands, aiming to eliminate their use altogether as soon as practicable, and instead, to utilise this material as a source of brick firing energy in the manufacturing of fired clay bricks and as a replacement for virgin brick soil. Based on a comprehensive data analysis, this study has calculated that in the European Union, the United States, China, Canada and Australia, approximately 26,042, 21,249, 13,660, 1,518 and 1,241 tonnes of microplastics, respectively, are added to farmlands annually as a result of biosolids application. The accumulation of microplastics produces detrimental effects on soil organisms and increases the accumulation of other micropollutants, such as heavy metals. The degradation of MPs over time is a source for the creation of nanoplastics, which pose a greater threat to ecosystems and human and animal health, as their size allows for their absorption into plant cells. On the other hand, the results of a comprehensive study at RMIT, including a comprehensive Life-Cycle Assessment, confirm that recycling biosolids in fired clay bricks (Bio-Bricks) is a promising sustainable alternative. This study proposes the mandatory addition of 7% biosolids in all brick manufacturing worldwide to utilize all biosolids production in fired clay bricks. This will reduce brick firing energy by over 12.5%."

In such situations, it is of utmost importance to extend the lifetime of the battery operated hand-held devices serving on the ground. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering technique to improve the energy efficiency of the terrestrial nodes served by the aerial base-station under uncertain channel conditions on the ground. The proposed technique is analysed by means of simulations and the results are compared with well-known clustering algorithms. The results show that the proposed clustering mechanism significantly improves the energy efficiency of the terrestrial nodes under certain conditions."

"Effects of advertising: A qualitative analysis of young adults’ engagement with social media about food Brand Placement; Food Advertising; Beverages Young adults are constantly exposed to energy-dense, nutrient-poor food and beverages, particularly through advertising. Exposure can influence poor food choices and negatively impact health. This study aimed to understand young adultsâ€™ attitudes and experiences associated with food-related advertisements, particularly on social media. This qualitative analysis involved n = 166 Australian 18 to 24-year-olds who were involved in a four-week online conversation on different areas relating to health, social media, and eating. Inductive thematic analysis was utilised on two forums on the recall and perceptions of food-related advertisements. Young adults commonly mentioned aspects of the marketing mix (promotion, product, price, and place) in food advertisements. Participants were more readily able to recall energy-dense, nutrient-poor food advertisements compared to healthy food-related advertisements. Digital advertisements were often discussed alongside the use of ad-blockers and algorithms which tailored their social media viewing to what they like. Participants felt constant exposure to unhealthy food advertisements hindered their ability to realise healthy eating behaviours and created feelings of guilt. This current analysis highlights the need to provide an advertising environment that appropriately motivates healthy eating and a food environment that allows healthy food to be the affordable and convenient option."

"Dynamics and drivers of per capita CO2 emissions in Asia Income Convergence; Structural Funds; European Union The aim of this paper is to document recent trends in Asia's CO2 emissions and explore the mechanisms that drive those emissions for fourteen countries over the period 1971 to 2017. We apply a sequential method which has a strong relationship to policy indicators. First, an analysis of the dynamics is undertaken to identify if convergence is occurring, followed by a study of the determinants of those dynamics. This approach overcomes some of the limitations of previous work analyzing emission convergence by focusing on country specific characteristics such as energy mix and energy efficiency. The analysis reveals per capita CO2 emissions, energy intensity, carbonization and per capita incomes are slowly converging over the full sample. Yet this behavior is not uniform; there were differences in transition paths prior to and after the Asian Financial Crisis. The per capita income driver was the most important driver in explaining the dynamics and variation of emissions while carbonization and energy intensity drivers were less pronounced. The analysis reveals that the energy needs of the region's extraordinary economic growth favored fossil fuels and a surprising revelation is that despite having different per capita income levels China, Korea, and Vietnam all share a common convergence path. This paper provides further evidence against using carbon intensity solely as a target for climate policy."

"House Dust Mite Aeroallergen Suppresses Leukocyte Phagocytosis and Netosis Initiated by Pneumococcal Lung Infection Extracellular Traps; Peptidylarginine Deiminase Type IV; Inflammation Asthmatics are highly susceptible to developing lower respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN, the pneumococcus). It has recently emerged that underlying allergic airway disease creates a lung microenvironment that is defective in controlling pneumococcal lung infections. In the present study, we examined how house dust mite (HDM) aeroallergen exposure altered immunity to acute pneumococcal lung infection. Alveolar macrophage (AM) isolated from HDM-exposed mice expressed alternatively activated macrophage (AAM) markers including YM1, FIZZ1, IL-10, and ARG-1. In vivo, prior HDM exposure resulted in accumulation of AAMs in the lungs and 2-log higher bacterial titres in the bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid of SPN-infected mice (Day 2). Acute pneumococcal infection further increased the expression of IL-10 and ARG1 in the lungs of HDM-exposed mice. Moreover, prior HDM exposure attenuated neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in the lungs and dsDNA levels in the BAL fluid of SPN-infected mice. In addition, HDM-SPN infected animals had significantly increased BAL fluid cellularity driven by an influx of macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Increased lung inflammation and mucus production was also evident in HDM-sensitised mice following acute pneumococcal infection, which was associated with exacerbated airway hyperresponsiveness. Of note, PCV13 vaccination modestly reduced pneumococcal titres in the BAL fluid of HDM-exposed animals and did not prevent BAL inflammation. Our findings provide new insights on the relationship between pneumococcal lung infections and allergic airways disease, where defective AM phagocytosis and NETosis are implicated in increased susceptibility to pneumococcal infection."

"The Toxicity of Nonaged and Aged Coated Silver Nanoparticles to Freshwater Alga Raphidocelis subcapitata Nanocrystal; Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticle; Ecotoxicity The transformation of coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and their impacts on aquatic organisms require further study. The present study investigated the role of aging on the transformation of differently coated AgNPs and their sublethal effects on the freshwater alga Raphidocelis subcapitata. The stability of AgNPs was evaluated over 32 d, and the results indicated that transformation of AgNPs occurred during the incubation; however, coating-specific effects were observed. Fresh AgNPs increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, whereas aged AgNPs induced excessive ROS generation compared with their fresh counterparts. Increased ROS levels caused increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) in treatment groups exposed to both fresh and aged NPs, although LPO was comparatively higher in algae exposed to aged AgNPs. The observed increase in catalase (CAT) activity of algal cells was attributed to early stress responses induced by excessive intracellular ROS generation, and CAT levels were higher in the aged NP treatment groups. In conclusion, AgNPs increased ROS levels and LPO in algae and caused the activation of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT. Overall, the results suggest that aging and coating of AgNPs have major impacts on AgNP transformation in media and their effects on algae. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2371â€“2382. Â© 2019 SETAC."
"Modeling a Digital Twin to Predict Battery Deterioration with Lower Prediction Error in Smart Devices: From the Internet of Things Sensor Devices to Self-Driving Cars Battery Pack; Electrode; Thermal Management The complete life cycle management of complex equipment is seen as critical to the smart transformation and upgrading of today's industrial industry. In recent years, digital twin (DT) technology and machine learning (ML) have arisen as emerging technologies. Developing technologies like DT technology and ML in entire battery life cycle management may make each stage of the life cycle more predictable and proactive. We propose a hybrid DT model based on ML that can enhance the performance of an existing DT mathematical model formulated to simulate lithium-ion battery deterioration behavior using DT technology. Firstly, we develop a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based model to forecast the error term of battery capacity enumerated for each charge and discharge cycle from the existing DT model. In this work, we use 18,650 lithium-ion battery discharge data from NASA Ames' prognostics data repository as our experimental data. The LSTM model is configured with Adam optimizer and the mean absolute error (MAE) loss function. The early stopping criterion is also employed as a regularization technique to overcome model overfitting. Secondly, we develop our proposed hybrid DT by integrating both the existing DT and the LSTM model. Thirdly, we formulate an empirical mathematical model, which allows us to better replicate behavior of battery degradation of any lithium-ion battery. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid DT in terms of the MAE metric. Compared with the existing model, our proposed model reduces the error of battery capacity during the entire degradation period by 68.42%."

"Untreated rice husk ash incorporated high strength self-compacting concrete: Properties and environmental impact assessments Cement; Rice Hulls; Mortar The suitability of untreated rice husk ash (URHA) as a supplementary to the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and fine aggregates (FA) in high strength self-compacting concrete (SCC) was investigated in terms of mechanical properties as well as environmental impact assessments (EIA). In total, nine SCC mixes were prepared and investigated with various levels of URHA replacements to OPC and FA. Initially, the fresh and hardened properties of URHA incorporated SCC were determined. Further, EIAs were carried out considering eighteen different environmental impact indices for the optimum URHA incorporated SCC mixes to determine the most appropriate mix in terms of mechanical properties along with their environmental impacts. The experimental results reveal, URHA in the range of 10â€“15% can be used without compromising the fresh and hardened properties of SCC. The results of the EIAs are presented and discussed in terms of compressive strength to environmental indices ratios to normalise the comparison. The EIAs disclose that even through some of the mixes provide better performance in terms of certain environmental impact categories; especially CO2 emission, water pollution (fresh and marine) and ecotoxicity, their strength to environmental impact ratios are relatively low. Thus, it is recommended to select the optimum mix design of URHA incorporated high strength SCC in terms of mechanical properties and as well as EIA."

"Remote monitoring techniques for rehabilitated slope Optical Correlation; Sensing; Time Domain Analysis AGL Loy Yang has been intensively engaged and involved in research in the area of rehabilitated mining slopes. A proposal was raised to turn the Loy Yang mine pit into a lake after decommission (in three decades) to achieve safe and stable rehabilitation of the mines. The slope stability of these rehabilitated slopes is one of the major concerns. The slopes are hardly failed spontaneously. Instead, they usually provide indications of distress (cracks and erosion) over some time. Therefore, an ongoing monitoring system may provide valuable time to mitigate the progression of the failure. Distributed optical fibre sensing (DOFS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are emerging new and innovative technologies for remote monitoring a large civil structure for early warnings, alerts and decision making. Both DOFS and UAV have been recently deployed at Loy Yang rehabilitated trial site. The preliminary results have demonstrated their reliability and practicality for these rehabilitated slope monitoring techniques. These remote sensing techniques are compared and discussed in terms of slope monitoring application."

"Carbon and polymer-based magnetic nanocomposites for oil-spill remediation—a comprehensive review Water; Hydrophobicity; Aerogels Oil spills are a major contributor to water contamination, which sets off a significant impact on the environment, biodiversity, and economy. Efficient removal of oil spills is needed for the protection of marine species as well as the environment. Conventional approaches are not efficient enough for oil-water separation; therefore, effective strategies and efficient removal techniques (and materials) must be developed to restore the contaminated marine to its normal ecology. Several research studies have shown that nanotechnology provides efficient features to clean up these oil spills from the water using magnetic nanomaterials, particularly carbon/polymer-based magnetic nanocomposites. Surface modification of these nanomaterials via different techniques render them with salient innovative features. The present review discusses the advantages and limitations of conventional and advanced techniques for the oil spills removal from wastewater. Furthermore, the synthesis of magnetic nanocomposites, their utilization in oil-water separation, and adsorption mechanisms are discussed. Finally, the advancement and future perspectives of magnetic nanocomposites (particularly of carbon and polymer-based magnetic nanocomposites) in environmental remediation are presented."

"Identifying organizational factors for successful business intelligence implementation Business Intelligence; Data Warehouses; Decision Making Business intelligence (BI) has proliferated due to its growing application for business decision support. Research on organizational factors may offer significant use in BI implementation. However, a limited number of studies focus on organizational factors for revealing adverse impacts on effective decision support. The aim of this theoretical study is to conduct a literature analysis to identify organizational factors relevant to BI implementation. Through a systematic literature review, a qualitative content analysis on 49 relevant sample articles for generating themes inductively is adopted to reveal organizational factors. Findings suggest two contexts: Information management that integrates factors such as technological capability and personnel capability and organizational context that integrates factors such as organizational capability, managerial decision, and organizational culture for facilitating embedding information management capability for BI implementation in businesses. It is hoped that these contextual understanding can be useful for further BI implementations."
"A Bourdieusian analysis of employment services workers in an era of Workfirst Employment Service; Activation; Welfare Reform This article draws on qualitative research which focused on worker experiences of Workfirst activation during the Job Services Australia (JSA) contract of employment services. The Workfirst orientation of Australian labour market programmes created imperatives for activation workers to monitor job seeker compliance with activity tests. As part of the broader cohort interviewed in the study, activation workers were interviewed about the way sanctions were used to discipline job seekers in street-level exchanges. These workers had experienced the transition from the Job Network to JSA and had observed how a shift to Workfirst became institutionalised in organisational practices and culture. Concepts from Bourdieu's field theory are used to situate activation workers in the employment services field that became more managerial during the transition to Workfirst and where sanction-based practice was mainstreamed. Drawing also on Peillon's sociology of welfare, employment services are described as part of the welfare field in which the activation workers experienced the misrecognition associated with Workfirst, which is described as a structure of domination. The analysis employs the concept of intersubjective recognition to draw attention to the subjective and objective co-construction of street-level interactions. This study has implications for understanding how welfare reforms affect activation workers, the contributors to the erosion of employment services capability, and the need for investment in workforce development in the employment services sector."

"Deterioration of transportation infrastructures: Corrosion of reinforcements in concrete structures Carbonation; Carbon Dioxide; Curing (Nonfood Products) The considerable network of transportation infrastructures such as highways, rails, and so forth are key providers to economic growth and productivity of countries. Consecutively, Reinforced Concrete (RC) is the predominant construction materials in constructing many of these infrastructures. RC is a unique construction material which allows flexible design layouts and offers safe bending and torsion to satisfy design requirements. However, being exposed to harsh environment and contamination such as salts, acid rain, distilled water, carbonation, sulphur and so on are the reasons for deterioration, thus significantly impacting the performance of these structures. Furthermore, the deterioration of these structures is not only a safety issue, but also an economic concern. Moreover, deterioration of concrete infrastructures can be attributed to many factors from structural deficiency to corrosion of reinforcement and thermal expansion due to fire damage. Accordingly, this paper will review the corrosion of reinforcements in concrete transportation Structures, and in doing so it will also examine some of the novel deterioration models to prolong concrete transportation structures."

"Learning UML Sequence Diagrams with a New Constructivist Pedagogical Tool: SD4ED Model-Driven Development; Cyperus; Software Increasingly, students from many different majors are taking foundational courses in Software Engineering (SE) where modelling forms a major part. Novices with limited Object-Oriented (OO) programming skills often find OO modelling concepts abstract and difficult when compared to other topics. In particular, dynamic modelling of sequence diagrams (SDs) was shown to pose the most difficulties when novices learn UML modelling. Novices often do not consider how SDs are constrained by static models such as class diagrams and fail to meet some of the postconditions specified in the use case descriptions. These problems are exacerbated for instructors teaching large classes unable to give adequate formative feedback in the early stages, leading to poor student satisfaction and learning outcomes. This paper explores the efficacy of using a constructivist-learning tool in large classes able to give immediate feedback in the early stages. In this paper, we report our experience of developing an interactive pedagogical tool called SD4ED to help students learn SDs. The main novelty of our approach is the mechanism devised to provide instant feedback while students are creating the SDs based on the constraints for the underlying static model, postconditions specified for the underlying use case and the current knowledge state aggregating past messages. Unlike other UML tools developed in the past, our tool helps students to create consistent and complete models using a constructivist approach. Our pre- A nd post-tests and survey feedback showed substantially improved learning outcomes and student satisfaction."

"Differentiation between Impacted and Unimpacted Microbial Communities of a Nitrogen Contaminated Aquifer Ecosystem; Macroinvertebrates; Gammarus Pulex Nitrogen contamination is ubiquitous across the globe; as a result of this, the need to understand and predict the extent and effects of nitrogen contamination on microbial ecosystems is increasingly important. This paper utilises a dataset that provides a rare opportunity to observe varying contamination conditions in a single aquifer and understand the differences between potential background bores and two different types of contamination spread across the other bores. Using physicochemical and microbiological community analysis, this paper aims to determine the impacts of the two contaminants, nitrate and ammonia, on the microbial communities and the differences between polluted and physicochemical background bores. Total nitrogen (N) varied by a factor of over 2000 between bores, ranging from 0.07 to 155 mg Lâˆ’1. Nitrate (NO3âˆ’) concentrations ranged from 150 to <0.01 mg Lâˆ’1; ammonium (NH4+) concentrations ranged from 26 to <0.1 mg Lâˆ’1. MANOVA analysis confirmed an overall significant relationship (p = 0.0052) between N variables and the physicochemical data (or status) of the three areas of contamination dubbed â€˜contamination zonesâ€™. The contamination zones were defined by no known presence of contamination in the uncontaminated bores, the presence of NO3âˆ’ contamination and the presence of NO3âˆ’ and NH4+ contamination. PERMANOVA analysis confirmed that there was an overall significant difference in the microbial communities between the three contamination zones (p = 0.0002); however, the presence of NH4+ had a significant effect (p = 0.0012). In general, the nitrate-contaminated bores showed a decrease in the abundance of individual OTUs. We further confirmed that NH4+ contamination had a significant relationship with an increased percentage of abundance occupied by the Planctomycetota phylum (specifically the Candidatus Brocadia genus). It was found that one of the two background bores (BS-004) was likely also representative of natural microbial background, and another (BS-002) showed characteristics that may be representative of past or intermittent contamination. This paper demonstrates a possible way to determine the microbial background and discusses the potential uses for this information."

"Should Australia be embracing the modern slavery model of regulation? Human Trafficking; Sexual Exploitation; Prostitution Australia is following in the footsteps of the UK and US and embracing the discourse and regulatory technologies associated with modern slavery regulation. This paper offers a critical perspective on this development. It begins with a brief account of the conceptâ€™s rise to prominence, and discusses the political economy in which it is embedded. It then explores some of the advantages, as well as the pitfalls, associated with the frame, and its associated regulatory approaches, techniques and discourse. The authors raise three broad sets of concerns. The first goes to the danger of exclusively focusing on criminal justice responses to penalise and deter those who practice modern slavery while neglecting other approaches that may help address the causes of the phenomenon. The second set of concerns goes to the tendency to exaggerate the transformative potential of one of the dominant regulatory responses in this area: the mandatory corporate supply chain reporting provision. The third set of concerns relate to the implications of addressing issues of worker exploitation and mistreatment through a modern slavery and human trafficking approach rather than through other well established and newer regulatory means. To support the third argument, the authors compare the modern slavery approach with two alternate approaches: labour regulation and human rights due diligence. The authors emphasise the need for vigilance to ensure that the embracement of a modern slavery frame does not shift attention (and resources) away from more thorough and effective means of securing greater corporate accountability for labour standards in supply chains."
"An industry structured for unsafety? An exploration of the cost-safety conundrum in construction project delivery Construction Safety; Occupational Accidents; Accident Construction accidents can have major social, financial, reputational and legal implications. Hence, it is to be expected that safety is often presented as a key priority for construction organisations. However, existing evidence suggests that within the construction industry, safety often loses the battle when a trade-off is required with project cost. Improved understanding of the manifestations of the cost and safety interaction are needed. A three-year longitudinal study afforded the opportunity to investigate the safety implications of sub-economic bids on a large infrastructure project in the UK. While low-bidding to win tenders is not new, this paper presents empirical evidence of the consequential safety risk implications of such bidding at the project delivery stage. Faced with a perverse form of the tender â€˜Winner's Curseâ€™ where the successful bid is frequently the lowest, cost-saving strategies are often implemented to recoup lost pricing margins. Our investigation revealed several instances of consequentially elevated safety risks, through cheaper and poor-quality equipment, machinery and temporary structures. In addition, lower-paid migrant workers â€“ who already experience a statistically greater safety risk than local workers â€“ were employed on the project without appropriate investment in a safety management approach suitable for a multinational workforce. The study both contributes to the call to critically rethink the construction industry's competitive bidding practices, and highlights an industry structure that creates the conditions for high safety risks and accidents."

"Critical factors influencing the intention to adopt m-government services by the elderly Technology Acceptance Model; Mobile Payment; E-Learning While the elderly population is growing rapidly, acceptance and use of m-government services by them are far below expectation. Previous studies on acceptance and use of m-government services have predominantly focused on younger citizens with skills and experience of information technologies. Drawing upon the dual factor model, this study investigates the enablers and inhibitors of the elderly's m-government service adoption behavior. Four constructs from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), namely, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence; and self-actualization are treated as enablers, while user resistance to change, technology anxiety, and declining physiological conditions are regarded as inhibitors. Results show that adoption of m-government by the elderly is significantly influenced by all tested enablers and inhibitors, except for social influence. This study contributes by providing an integrative model of technology acceptance for the elderly along with practical implications for policy makers."

"Impact of microalgae species and solution salinity on algal treatment of wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Six common microalgal species, including freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus abundans, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Coelastrum microporum, and marine microalgae Nannochloropsis salina and Dunaliella tertiolecta, were tested in batch treatment to identify the most promising species for remediating a municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC). Selected species were then studied at different ROC salinity levels (5, 10, and 15 g TDS/L) in semi-continuous treatment to evaluate their potential for nutrient remediation, and biogas production through anaerobic digestion. S. abundans, C. vulgaris, and N. salina showed higher potential for growth and nutrient remediation under salinity stress. Further tests revealed that N. salina adapted well to ROC conditions, and S. abundans could grow better and had higher tolerance to the elevated salinity than C. vulgaris. S. abundans and N. salina performed better for removing nutrients and organic matter (11.5â€“18 mg/L/d TN, 7.1â€“8.2 mg/L/d TP, and 8.6â€“12.4 mg/L/d DOC). Increasing salinity led to growth inhibition and N uptake reduction for freshwater species but had no significant effect on TP removal. Biochemical methane potential tests showed the algal biomass produced a significant amount of methane (e.g., up to 422 mL CH4/g VS for N. salina), suggesting the algae generated from the ROC treatment could produce significant amounts of energy through anaerobic digestion without the need for pretreatment. This study showed the environmental and economic potential of the algal system for future applications."
"Recycled cardboard trusses for housing construction Cardboards that are normally recycled post their utility have surprisingly high structural strengths per unit cross sectional area. However, their application similar to wooden materials has been limited in the past owing to their dimensional instability under certain loading conditions. In this project, an innovative approach to control the dimensional instability of cardboard sections will be developed from core engineering principles. This theoretical approach will be augmented by strengthening and testing cardboards in the laboratory. These strengthened sections with proper connections will be used to construct a truss. This proof-of-concept design and application will be tested to Australian Standard loading conditions in the laboratory and evaluated by industry partners with practical application to case study sites. Benefits of this project include a possible new approach to repurposing cardboard wastes, sustainability enhancement of saving the natural resource timber, reduction of cardboard landfill by about 20% in Victoria, and cheaper construction costs."

"Analyzing Wildfire Evacuation Behavior with GPS Data (60NANB20D182) (administered by University of Florida, USA) The previous e-Sanctuary project (funded by NIST, 60NANB16D282) and WUI-NITY projects (funded by NIST, 60NANB18D255) produced an integrated software platform for the simulation of WUI evacuation scenarios. This was a proof-of-concept model that demonstrates that three core sub-domains (fire progression, pedestrian movement and traffic movement) can be coupled within the same simulated environment to produce qualitative insights that are impossible to achieve when domains are considered
independently from one another. Macroscopic sub-models have been embedded to demonstrate this proof of concept; i.e., that models from different subject domains interact to exchange information to produce insights into evacuee performance that enables the identification of vulnerable locations and populations."

"A cross-sectional and longitudinal study of neighbourhood disadvantage and cardiovascular disease and the mediating role of physical activity Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians We investigate the prospective association between neighbourhood-level disadvantage and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among mid-to-older aged adults and whether physical activity (PA) mediates this association. The data come from the HABITAT project, a multilevel longitudinal investigation of health and wellbeing in Brisbane. The participants were 11,035 residents of 200 neighbourhoods in 2007, with follow-up data collected in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2016. Multilevel binomial regression was used for the cross-sectional analysis and mixed-effect parametric survival models were used for the longitudinal analysis. Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, occupation, and household income. Those with pre-existing CVD at baseline were excluded from the longitudinal analyses. The mediated effect of PA on CVD was examined using multilevel generalized structural equation modelling. There was a total of 20,064 person-year observations across the five time-points clustered at three levels. Results indicated that the incidence of CVD was significantly higher in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods (OR 1.50; HR 1.29) compared with the least disadvantaged. Mediation analysis results revealed that 11.5% of the effect of neighbourhood disadvantage on CVD occurs indirectly through PA in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods while the corresponding figure is 5.2% in the more advantaged areas. Key findings showed that neighbourhood disadvantage is associated with the incidence of CVD, and PA is a significant mediator of this relationship. Future research should investigate which specific social and built environment features promote or inhibit PA in disadvantaged areas as the basis for policy initiatives to address inequities in CVD."

"A psycho-Geoinformatics approach for investigating older adults’ driving behaviours and underlying cognitive mechanisms Elderly Driver; Automobile Driving; Traffic Behavior Introduction: Safe driving constantly challenges the driverâ€™s ability to respond to the dynamic traffic scene under space and time constraints. It is of particular importance for older drivers to perform sufficient visual and motor actions with effective coordination due to the fact of age-related cognitive decline. However, few studies have been able to integrate driversâ€™ visual-motor behaviours with environmental information in a spatial-temporal context and link to the cognitive conditions of individual drivers. Little is known about the mechanisms that underpin the deterioration in visual-motor coordination of older drivers. Development: Based on a review of driving-related cognitive decline in older adults and the context of driver-vehicle-environment interactions, this paper established a conceptual framework to identify the parameters of driverâ€™s visual and motor behaviour, and reveal the cognitive process from visual search to vehicle control in driving. The framework led to a psycho-geoinformatics approach to measure older driversâ€™ driving behaviours and investigate the underlying cognitive mechanisms. The proposed data collection protocol and the analysis and assessments depicted the psycho-geoinformatics approach on obtaining quantified variables and the key means of analysis, as well as outcome measures. Conclusions: Recordings of the driver and their interactions with the vehicle and environment at a detailed scale give a closer assessment of the driverâ€™s behaviours. Using geoinformatics tools in driving behaviours assessment opens a new era of research with many possible analytical options, which do not have to rely on human observations. Instead, it receives clear indicators of the individual driversâ€™ interactions with the vehicle and the traffic environment. This approach should make it possible to identify lower-performing older drivers and problematic visual and motor behaviours, and the cognitive predictors of risky driving behaviours. A better targeted regulation and tailored intervention programs for older can be developed by further research."
"Shared personal reflections on the need to broaden the scope of conservation social science Agriculture; Common Agricultural Policy; Farmers Social science has a more diverse and meaningful role to play in conservation science and ecology than is currently being published within this field. We reflect on our personal research experiences to demonstrate how our in-field learning has provided us with shared understandings of the importance of a broader engagement with social science methods, methodologies and philosophy. We focus on the value that comes from understanding that social science is not just answers, but stories; not just data, but meaning; and that place is a critical part of understanding socio-ecological phenomena and processes. We engage in a shared process of reflexivity of our doctoral research experiences to show the potential of social science beyond its predominant positivist applications in the conservation science and ecology literature. We each discuss our experiences of our social science research endeavours in the context of private land conservation. We then distil our experiences into three themes that aim to advance social science engagement for conservation scientists: the partiality of knowledge, situating research within socio-ecological context and researcher positionality. We conclude by acknowledging that as researchers we are not the exclusive authority on knowledge; that a deep understanding of conservation and ecology challenges might not provide simple or reducible answers that can be abstracted and applied universally; and that we must reflect on the possibilities for a more plural and diverse research practice for conservation and ecology through a wider engagement with the social sciences.

Alpine environments depend on snow to regulate water flows, insulate vegetation, control soil erosion and promote proper ecosystem functioning. How these processes will operate in a snow-free future is unknown. We will determine how and where snow characteristics drive soil water availability for plants and which plant species have the best adaptation and regeneration potential under extreme

"Improving support for LGBTIQ suicidal behaviour: insight from lived experience LGBTIQ people experience elevated rates of psychological distress and an increased lifetime risk for suicidal behaviour. ‘Minority stress’ is a major explanation for this but does not sufficiently address the fact that LGBTIQ people often belong to other ‘minority’ communities or culturally diverse groups. In Australia, where little is known about suicidal behaviour and preventative strategies for LGBTIQ communities, this project is a vital step towards address this gap. Through a qualitative study we aim to understand factors that influence and protect against suicidal behaviour in LGBTIQ communities, and support practices and services that are experienced as helpful to prevent or manage it. We will generate new knowledge about lived experiences of LGBTIQ suicidal behaviour (including distress, thoughts and attempts) in culturally diverse LGBTIQ communities in Australia, including Indigenous LGBTIQ groups. The project is an innovative partnership with Switchboard, Victoria, Roses in the Ocean, and a cross-sector LGBTIQ advisory group including Indigenous representation and Beyond Blue. Framed by a co-design methodology, implementation and evaluation plan, we will synthesise findings from a rapid evidence assessment and 25 interviews with LGBTIQ people with lived experience, including Indigenous participants. Findings will be translated into policy briefings, a training workshop for suicide prevention and support in LGBTIQ communities and disseminated through publications and a stakeholder dissemination event. Finally, we will pilot our research partnership and co-design approach prior to a large grant application focused on evaluating suicide prevention services for culturally diverse LGBTIQ communities."

"Ladies selling breakfast: COVID-19 disruption of intimate socialities among street-engaged food traders in Ho Chi Minh city Vietnam; Wildcat Strike; Urbanization Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnamâ€™s largest city, supports a vibrant street food culture. Most of the cityâ€™s street-engaged food traders are poor and unskilled women, and there is scant research about how they build social networks and social capital that sustain their micro-businesses. This article focusses on the intimate socialities that street-engaged food traders develop with customers, shop owners and sister-traders in order to stabilise their incomes while their informal street-trading activities are policed and potentially shut down. Recent COVID-19 lockdown and social-distancing measures disrupted the crucial interpersonal relations of street trading and left the traders with no income. This article explores tradersâ€™ strate-gies for achieving economic security, and outlines transformations of intimate socialities into mediated and digital relations after the lockdown."

"Who Goes to Metropolitan Parks? A Latent Class Analysis Approach to Understanding Park Visitation Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians This study aimed to identify typologies of park visitors and to examine associations among these typologies and socio-demographic characteristics. In 2013, intercept interviews were completed with 794 adult park visitors at two large parks located in Melbourne, Australia. Latent class analysis identified three classes of visitor: physically active visitor, with dog (12.4%); physically active visitor, with no dog (35.7%); and infrequent, low active, social visitor (51.9%). Respondents who were older and owned a dog had higher odds of being in Class 1 and Class 2. Respondents who had children had higher odds of being in Class 3. Respondents who reported poor health were less likely to be in Class 2 than in Class 3. Park users can be distinguished by the behaviors in which they engage. Understanding typologies of visitors will assist with the development of intervention strategies to optimize park visitation and park-based physical activity."

"The Role of Government in a Partial Transition from Public to Private in the Expanding Australian Protected Area System Payments For Ecosystem Services; Payment; China Since the 1980s in democratic societies, neoliberal reforms and neofeudal governance have transferred the delivery of many public goods and services from governments to non-government actors. Privatisation is a core neoliberal agenda, but little is known of the nature and extent of its application to nature conservation through reservation. We investigate the degree of privatisation of the expanding protected area system in our case study areas of Australia and Tasmania, hypothesising that governments have: disrupted public agencies managing the protected area estate by repeated reorganisation; diverted public funds from public to private protected areas; and increasingly alienated public reserves for subsidised private profit from tourism. We found frequent restructuring of agencies managing protected areas. Although Federal Government expenditure on private reserves increased markedly in the twenty-first century, so did expenditure on public conservation reserves. All States except Queensland increased public protected area funding. Direct subsidisation of private reserves by government has not had a steady upward trajectory. In contrast, subsidisation of private alienation of public conservation reserves for tourism may have accelerated in the twenty-first century. We conclude that, while Australian governments see value in protected areas as a source of economic development and electoral advantage, they are agnostic on ownership."

"Temperature shocks and energy poverty: Findings from Vietnam Energy; Energy Poverty; Fuelwood Globally, billions of people live in energy poverty without the means to access affordable and clean energy which are fundamental to sustainable development. Climate change is aggravating increasing demand for energy through a general rise in temperatures as well as through short periods of unusually high heat. This paper examines the impact of temperature shocks on energy poverty in Vietnam. Using data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (2010 to 2016) and data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts it finds temperature shocks lead to increases in a measure of multidimensional energy poverty. This finding is robust to different measures of temperature shocks. Households in the North and Central coast regions of Vietnam are most prone to the impacts of temperature shocks as well as households located in rural areas. Further findings suggest that temperature shocks impact on energy poverty through reducing agricultural output."

Design methodology/approach: Twenty-four experts were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Findings: Experts reported that young adults experienced economic exploitation, adverse economic entanglement and economic control. Young adultsâ€™ frame of reference was a challenge for practitioners. Experts believed that more work needed to be done to improve the financial literacy of young adults. Research limitations/implications: Practitioner views provide one side of the story. A separate study has been established interviewing young adults to explore these issues further. Practical implications: The authors argue that prevention and intervention strategies need to focus on young adults who are in their critical relationship formation stage. The identified attitudinal factors present a challenge to policy, prevention and service providers. Originality/value: The authors shift the attention from service engaged women leaving violent relationships to young adults who have not sought assistance from community or domestic violence services. In doing so, they highlight the importance of the relationship formation phase. This paper raises the challenge for social marketers to consider appropriate prevention and intervention programmes for this cohort. Current and future campaigns and programmes need to be designed and evaluated with an economic abuse lens."
"Hardware-intrinsic security primitives enabled by analogue state and nonlinear conductance variations in integrated memristors Hardware Security; Internet Of Things; RRAM Hardware-intrinsic security primitives employ instance-specific and process-induced variations in electronic hardware as a source of cryptographic data. Among various emerging technologies, memristors offer unique opportunities in such security applications due to their underlying stochastic operation. Here we show that the analogue tuning and nonlinear conductance variations of memristors can be used to build a basic building block for implementing physically unclonable functions that are resilient, dense, fast and energy-efficient. Using two vertically integrated 10 Ã— 10 metal-oxide memristive crossbar circuits, we experimentally demonstrate a security primitive that offers a near ideal 50% average uniformity and diffuseness, as well as a minimum bit error rate of around 1.5 Â± 1%. Readjustment of the conductances of the devices allows nearly unique security instances to be implemented with the same crossbar circuit."
"Utilization of oil palm fronds for bio-oil and bio-char production using hydrothermal liquefaction technology Hydrothermal Liquefaction; Bio-Oil; Biofuel Hydrothermal liquefaction technology carried out on local Malaysian oil palm fronds (OPF) in a batch autoclave reactor to produce solid bio-char as well as liquid bio-oil is reported in this study. The parameters taken in consideration for study encapsulated variable reaction temperature (160â€“260 Â°C) and reaction times (20â€“100 min). Observations showed that the bio-oil yield percentage increased from 27.3% at 160 Â°C to 41.9% at 260 Â°C, whereas bio-char yield percentage decreased from 65.2% at 160 Â°C to 43.2% at 260 Â°C. Similarly, higher reaction time also produces higher yield bio-oil percentage and lower bio-char yield percentage. The characterization results showed that the combustion properties of bio-char and bio-oil were improved after hydrothermal liquefaction due to decrease in percentage of oxygen of bio-oil and bio-char and an increase in percentage of carbon content. The carbon percentage increased from 42.73% for OPF to 59.42% and 60.47% for bio-char and bio-oil, respectively. Whereas, the percentage of oxygen decreased from 52.51 for OPF to 36.30% and 35.61 for bio-char and bio-oil. The main chemical compounds identified in bio-oil by GC-MS were phenolic compounds and their derivatives, alcohols, ketones, and esters."

"Smart waste management pilot - IoT integrated bin sensors Inefficient garbage collection practices can add considerable overheads to council budgets. Brimbank City Council has a broad portfolio of facilities spread across several suburbs, each producing waste daily. For a given bin, if the collection times are too frequent, the bin could still be half empty by the time the collection happens, leading to waste of energy and time. On the contrary, if it is too infrequent and the bin has overfilled, the uses of the facility will be unsatisfied. Fine-tuning the balance between the frequency of collection and fill times can prove to be difficult as the rates can be seasonal or event-based. One option to overcome the uncertainty related to the problem can be to monitor the bin use in real-time."
"Humidification-dehumidification desalination cycle Solar Still; Humidifiers; Desalination Water availability is an essential requirement for continuing human life on Earth. With the increasing world population and rapid industrial growth in some regions of the world, the demand for freshwater has increased significantly over the past decade. The availability of freshwater in many densely populated regions is a critical issue for socioeconomic stability. Seawater or brackish water desalination using solar energy can offer a solution for some of these areas. The humidification-dehumidification (HDH) desalination cycle is one of these technologies for producing freshwater from seawater or salty water for small-scale and remote area applications. The major form of energy needed for the technology is a low-temperature thermal energy that can be provided by sources such as industrial waste heat, solar thermal, geothermal, etc. This chapter is divided into the following subsections: HDH desalination, working principle, theoretical analysis method, humidifier and dehumidifier, heat sources, applications."

"Political connections and post-disaster assistance in rural Vietnam Vietnam; Wildcat Strike; Urbanization Political connections have been shown to lead to corruption, favouritism and the pursuit of self-interests. They can therefore serve as an impediment to development and poverty reduction. This study examines whether having political connections is associated with post-disaster support from government authorities in the case of Vietnam. Using commune level data for the period 2012 to 2014 and a number of alternative econometric specifications, it finds that communes with higher levels of connections at the district level have a higher probability of receiving support in a post-shock period. The type of political connections is found to be important. We find a strong impact of political connections when household members are officials themselves or when households have relatives as officials. Having friends as officials does not appear to impact the likelihood of receiving assistance. The impacts are also greater when households have siblings, offspring or cousins working in government, but no evidence is found when officials are parents. Finally, having connections with district leaders is more important than connections with district officials."

"An end-user-focused building energy audit: A high-density multi-residential development in Melbourne, Australia Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Office Buildings This chapter aims to demonstrate a building energy audit process using a case study of high-density multi-residential modular development in inner Melbourne, Australia. An energy audit is essential to understand where and how energy is used in buildings and consequently to identify those areas where improvements can be made. It includes a series of activities such as pre-survey data collection, walk-through inspection, data collection, analysis of the data collected and formulation of energy efficiency solutions. Extensive data were collected including indoor condition monitoring, occupant feedback and utility usage. The occupant survey identified thermal discomfort in summer, reporting overheating, dry and stuffy conditions. Energy consumption in the case study building was found to be significantly less than the average consumption in the same suburb. Surprisingly, energy consumption was found to be more likely to be affected by housing tenure types than physical building conditions such as orientation and height. The impact of building materials on occupants and the provision of air conditioning systems in the individual unit need to be further researched to resolve overheating problems. It is recommended that not only the design and physical conditions of buildings but also the socio-economic status of building residents could be main factors to achieve a high level of energy efficiency in multi-residential buildings."

"A holistic framework towards understanding the optical and dielectric behaviors of CH3NH3PbCl3 perovskites/graphene oxide hybrid films for light absorbing active layer Perovskite Solar Cells; Solar Cell; Formamidine In this work methylammonium trichloride CH3NH3Cl3 (MACl), methylammonium lead trichloride CH3NH3PbCl3 (MAPbCl), and graphene oxide (GO) doped methylammonium lead trichloride GO-CH3NH3PbCl3 (MAPbCl:GO) perovskite based thin film coatings deposited onto glass substrates using wet-chemical based spin coating technique at varying GO concentrations (0.025, 0.050, 0.075 â€‹g/ml), were investigated for their structural, compositional, optical, and dielectric characteristics. Characterizations of the coatings were carried out using XRD, SEM, FTIR, and UVâ€“Vis spectroscopic methods. The XRD patterns and scanning electron microscope images revealed the cubic and regular constructions of MAPbCl and MAPbCl:GO with higher degree of crystallinity. FTIR studies demonstrated different vibrational modes mainly dominated by the organic salt (MACl) in both structures and a few new bonds such as C[dbnd]C stretching, Câ€“H (methyl) bending, CH3â€“NH3 rocking were observed. Effective changes in the band-gap values were observed due to GO incorporation. A good correlation among different optical parameter such as absorption coefficient, refractive index, extinction coefficient, and dielectric function was also pragmatic. A very high value of the optical conductivity of 2.02 â€‹Ã— â€‹1014 â€‹Î©/nm was shown by MAPbCl:GO (0.05 â€‹g/ml) perovskite composite. Hence, MAPbCl:GO coatings could be successfully used as a good light absorbing layer in perovskite solar cell (PSC) in an open-air environment and may be explored for further development to achieve a stable structure."

"Static and dynamic properties of a perforated metallic auxetic metamaterial with tunable stiffness and energy absorption Negative; Honeycomb Cores; Metamaterials Auxetic metamaterials have attracted increasing attention due to their exceptional mechanical properties. However, the critical parameters of mechanical response and Poisson's ratio would be changed simultaneously when a geometrical parameter is tuned, which is adverse to achieving the quantitative design of energy absorption by tuning a single geometrical parameter. Thus, the methodology based on tuning densification strain is proposed to design auxetic unit cells with tunable stiffness. In this study, the static performance of 2D metallic auxetic metamaterials designed by the variable stiffness factor (VSF) method is examined experimentally and numerically. To further achieve tunable energy absorption under crushing load, the concept of VSF is extended to variable energy factor (VEF). The dynamic response of verified numerical models is investigated subjected to low-, medium-, and high-velocity crushing. Finally, a functionally graded auxetic structure with different design layers is proposed to effectively solve the issues of high stiffness ratio and initial peak force. These results show that the designed structure has the actual VSF and VEF percentages close to the designed value under low- and medium-velocity crushing. The findings from this study are useful for wider applications of auxetics in protective engineering."
"The correlation between GNSS-derived precipitable water vapor and sea surface temperature and its responses to El Niño–Southern Oscillation Precipitable Water; Global Positioning System; GNSS EI NiÃ±oâ€“Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a complex ocean-atmosphere interaction phenomenon occurring in nature that has a profound impact on global atmospheric circulation. As ENSO is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon, in addition to the commonly used sea surface temperature (SST), water vapor in the atmosphere can be used to monitor the evolution of ENSO and to investigate its consequences (e.g., droughts and flooding). The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), in addition to its applications for positioning, timing, and navigation, is another established atmospheric observing system used to remotely sense precipitable water vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere. The accuracy of the GNSS-derived PWV measurements was assessed from 12 stations based on observations made at co-located radiosonde stations as a reference. The results show that mean values of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and biases of 6-hourly GNSS-derived PWV derived from all 12 stations are valued at 1.48 mm and âˆ’0.30 mm, respectively. Regarding monthly means, mean values of the RMSE and biases of the GNSS-derived PWV are valued at 0.66 mm and âˆ’0.23 mm, respectively. The variability in PWV estimated from 56 GNSS stations positioned close to the sea indicates that it is significantly affected by ENSO events. Generally, a 1-K increase in SST will lead to an 11% increase in PWV across all of the stations. A case study conducted at the TOW2 station in Australia shows that the non-linear trend of the PWV depicts the evolution of two severe flood events and one severe drought event occurring in this region. Comparative results derived from TOW2 and from another 24 stations show a good agreement between PWV and total precipitation. These results suggest that GNSS-derived PWV together with other climatic variables (e.g., SST) can be used as an indication of the evolution of ENSO events and as a possible indicator of drought and flood occurrence."
"Liquid-Metal-Enabled Mechanical-Energy-Induced CO2 Conversion Carbon Dioxide; Electrocatalysts; Chemical Reduction A green carbon capture and conversion technology offering scalability and economic viability for mitigating CO2 emissions is reported. The technology uses suspensions of gallium liquid metal to reduce CO2 into carbonaceous solid products and O2 at near room temperature. The nonpolar nature of the liquid gallium interface allows the solid products to instantaneously exfoliate, hence keeping active sites accessible. The solid co-contributor of silverâ€“gallium rods ensures a cyclic sustainable process. The overall process relies on mechanical energy as the input, which drives nano-dimensional triboelectrochemical reactions. When a gallium/silver fluoride mix at 7:1 mass ratio is employed to create the reaction material, 92% efficiency is obtained at a remarkably low input energy of 230 kWh (excluding the energy used for dissolving CO2) for the capture and conversion of a tonne of CO2. This green technology presents an economical solution for CO2 emissions."

"Fame, What's your name? quasi and statistical gender discrimination in an art valuation experimentc Ethnic Discrimination; Job Applications; Field Experiment We conduct five experimental studies to examine whether and what kind of gender discrimination explains deep and persistent gender gaps in the art market. 1112 participants chose between male and female-originated artworks with and without artist information. Gender-specific artist names did not affect personal preferences or preference norms. They did however cause significant swings towards male artworks when participants were incentivised to guess the more pedigreed or more expensive artwork. When artist name information was controlled, manipulating artist fame information shifted preference norms towards artworks of males, who are more famous on average. Overall we find no taste-based but significant statistical gender discrimination. We also find quasi gender discrimination, in which discrimination based on a particular characteristic (fame) may be falsely attributed to a highly-correlated one (gender)."

"Monitoring aboveground forest biomass dynamics over three decades using Landsat time-series and single-date inventory data Landsat; Land Cover; Remote Sensing Understanding forest biomass dynamics is crucial for carbon and environmental monitoring, especially in the context of climate change. In this study, we propose a robust approach for monitoring aboveground forest biomass (AGB) dynamics by combining Landsat time-series with single-date inventory data. We developed a Random Forest (RF) based kNN model to produce annual maps of AGB from 1988 to 2017 over 7.2 million ha of forests in Victoria, Australia. The model was internally evaluated using a bootstrapping technique. Predictions of AGB and its change were then independently evaluated using multi-temporal Lidar data (2008 and 2016). To understand how natural and anthropogenic processes impact forest AGB, we analysed trends in relation to the history of disturbance and recovery. Specifically, change metrics (e.g., AGB loss and gain, Years to Recovery - Y2R) were calculated at the pixel level to characterise the patterns of AGB change resulting from forest dynamics. The imputation model achieved a RMSE value of 132.9 Mg haâˆ’1 (RMSE% = 46.3%) and R2 value of 0.56. Independent assessments of prediction maps in 2008 and 2016 using Lidar-based AGB data achieved relatively high accuracies, with a RMSE of 108.6 Mg haâˆ’1 and 135.9 Mg haâˆ’1 for 2008 and 2016, respectively. Annual validations of AGB maps using un-changed, homogenous Lidar plots suggest that our model is transferable through time (RMSE ranging from 109.65 Mg haâˆ’1 to 112.27 Mg haâˆ’1 and RMSE% ranging from 25.38% to 25.99%). In addition, changes in AGB values associated with forest disturbance and recovery (decrease and increase, respectively) were captured by predicted maps. AGB change metrics indicate that AGB loss and Y2R varied across bioregions and were highly dependent on levels of disturbance severity (i.e., a greater loss and longer recovery time were associated with a higher severity disturbance). On average, high severity fire burnt from 200 Mg haâˆ’1 to 550 Mg haâˆ’1 of AGB and required up to 15 years to recover while clear-fell logging caused a reduction in 250 Mg haâˆ’1 to 600 Mg haâˆ’1 of AGB and required nearly 20 years to recover. In addition, AGB within un-disturbed forests showed statistically significant but monotonic trends, suggesting a mild gradual drop over time across most bioregions. Our methods are designed to support forest managers and researchers in developing forest monitoring systems, especially in developing regions, where only a single date forestry inventory exists."

"Evaluation of membrane cake fouling mechanism to estimate design parameters of a submerged AnMBR treating high strength industrial wastewater Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling A mathematical model, which was previously developed for submerged aerobic membrane bioreactors, was successfully applied to elucidate the membrane cake-layer fouling mechanisms due to bound extracellular polymeric substances (eEPS) in a submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor (SAnMBR). This biofouling dynamic model explains the mechanisms such as attachment, consolidation and detachment of eEPS produced in the bioreactor on the membrane surface. The 4th order Runge-Kutta method was used to solve the model equations, and the parameters were estimated from simulated and experimental results. The key design parameters representing the behaviour of cake fouling dynamics were systematically investigated. Organic loading rate (OLR) was considered a controlling factor governing the mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), eEPS production, filtration resistance (Rt), and transmembrane pressure (TMP) variations in a SAnMBR. eEPS showed a proportional relation with OLR at subsequent MLSS variations. The consolidation of EPS increased the specific eEPS resistance (Î±s), influencing the cake resistance (Rc). The propensities of eEPS showed a positive correlation with Rt and TMP. The outcomes of the study also estimated a set of valuable design parameters which would be vital for applying in AnMBRs treating industrial wastewater."

"R&D expenditure and energy consumption in OECD nations Experience Curve; Technological Learning; Costs And Cost Analysis We examine the time-varying effect of energy technology R&D spending (R&D) on energy consumption per capita. In doing so, we utilise a data-driven local linear dummy variable estimation (LLDVE) method, which we apply to a panel of OECD nations for the period 1980 to 2014. Our LLDVE estimates point to a time-varying and positive effect of R&D on total energy consumption. We disaggregate energy consumption into non-renewable and renewable energy consumption to determine the heterogenous effects of innovation. On the non-renewable side, R&D shows a positive impact on non-renewable energy consumption, although this is observed since 1998. On the renewable side, the uptake of R&D is associated with positive and significant effects until 1996 where the effect reverts to negative. Our findings suggest that while global energy transformation to renewables has been on the rise, continual technological breakthroughs may promote higher levels of sustainable energy and, thus, help achieve the desired global temperature."

"Reducing tumour incidence in adolescents with germ-line mutations in RECQL4 (Administered by St Vincents Hospital) This proposal addresses Stream 2: Cancer in adolescents.
Substantiating evidence of direct relevance to grant call: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common cancer of bone, with a peak incidence during late childhood and adolescence. OS affects 3.4 people per million each year (2.7-4.3; 95% CI) in Australia, with its incidence increasing 1.1% annually between 1983-2015 (1). For patients with localised disease, 5-year survival rates have stagnated at 70% and no substantive changes to treatment (conventional chemotherapy and surgery) have been achieved for greater than three decades (2).
Patients with metastatic or relapsed OS currently have a 20-30% 5-yr survival rate (3), and there is an urgent need to identify new therapeutics for this cohort. Whole genome sequencing and exome capture have transformed our understanding of the genetics of conventional human OS, with the universal mutation of TP53 accompanied by recurrent mutation of RB1, ATRX and DLG2 in 29-53% of cases (4-6). However, to date no clinically actionable targets have been defined using these approaches."

Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts the grounded theory approach, using semi-structured in-depth interviews with 31 women entrepreneurs in the coffee industry in the rural Central Highlands of Vietnam. Findings: This study found that necessity-driven factors play an important role in motivating female entrepreneurs to advance their careers. However, these factors may be transformed into the opportunity-driven motives. Furthermore, the findings suggest that Asiaâ€™s collectivism culture and family support significantly affect the success of the women entrepreneurs, although gender inequality is not perceived as a serious constraint in entrepreneurial activities. Research limitations/implications: This study has implications for the literature of women entrepreneurs regarding motivations and contextual influences in agricultural and rural areas of Vietnam. However, the sample size is relatively small which limits the concept generation of the study. For further research, a larger sample size with different business sectors should be considered to generate more explicit findings. Practical implications: The findings from this study can assist the policymakers in developing strategies and governmental policies to support the career advancement of women entrepreneurs and improving gender equality in Vietnam.

Microwave-enhanced modification of carbon nanomaterials is a noninvasive, simple, fast, environmentally friendly, and clean method as compared to traditional methods. The microwave facilitates and accelerates the reaction, often improving relative yield. In this chapter, a very brief summary of synthesis of carbon nanomaterials is discussed. Hence, microwave-assisted carbon nanomaterials seem to be the most promising method for possible industrial scale up due to the relatively low growth temperature, high surface area, high adsorption capacity, low pollution, and energy saving."
"Accounting professionalization, the state, and transnational capitalism: The case of Iran Accounting Profession; Accountants; Professionalization We examine accounting professionalization in Iran to understand state-controlled adaptation of Iran's professional accounting organization in response to transnational pressure. Using a neo-Gramscian theory of hegemony, the study shows that Iran's accounting occupation as an element of civil society was re-constituted through the interplay of shifting state ideology and transnational capitalism over the past five decades. The state's desire to integrate Iran with the global financial system in recent decades drove changes to Iran's accounting professional organization for alignment with transnational norms. The adaptation occurred amidst local resistance to transnational preference for granting regulatory powers to an autonomous professional accounting body. The study highlights professional autonomy as a contested ideational site of struggle in this process. The state preserved standard setting authority within the state apparatus, granted statutory audit and professional certification powers to an ideologically-trusted professional body, and relegated an accounting association construed as espousing neoliberal ideology to the politically less sensitive responsibility of offering professional education. We interpret this regulatory role specialization of the occupational groups as a product of the state's selective co-optation of the groups on ideological grounds. The study highlights the role of a country's ideological distance from neoliberalism in shaping adaptation of regulatory institutions for alignment to transnational norms."

"Concentrating solar power tower technology: Present status and outlook Parabolic; Solar Power Plants; Solar Thermal Energy The paper examines design and operating data of current concentrated solar power (CSP) solar tower (ST) plants. The study includes CSP with or without boost by combustion of natural gas (NG), and with or without thermal energy storage (TES). Latest, actual specific costs per installed capacity are high, 6,085 $/kW for Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System (ISEGS) with no TES, and 9,227 $/kW for Crescent Dunes with TES. Actual production of electricity is low and less than the expected. Actual capacity factors are 22% for ISEGS, despite combustion of a significant amount of NG exceeding the planned values, and 13% for Crescent Dunes. The design values were 33% and 52%. The study then reviews the proposed technology updates to improve ratio of solar field power to electric power, capacity factor, matching of production and demand, plant's cost, reliability and life span of plant's components. Key areas of progress are found in materials and manufacturing processes, design of solar field and receiver, receiver and power block fluids, power cycle parameters, optimal management of daily and seasonal operation of the plant, new TES concepts, integration of solar plant with thermal desalination or combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) installations and specialization of project."

"Optimizing rooftop photovoltaic distributed generation with battery storage for peer-to-peer energy trading Demand Response; Demand Side Management; Energy Conservation Distributed generation (DG) based on rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems with battery storages is a promising alternative energy generation technology to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. As regulatory tariff-based incentives are diminishing, innovative solutions are required to sustain this renewable energy generation. An optimization model is proposed to maximize the economic benefits for rooftop PV-battery DG in a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading environment. The goal of the proposed model is to investigate the feasibility of such renewable source participated P2P energy trading by examining the economic benefits. The model is illustrated in a simulation framework for a local community with 500 households under real-world constraints encompassing PV systems, battery storage, customer demand profiles and market signals including the retail price, feed-in tariff and P2P energy trading mechanism. Interactions among peer-to-peer trading stakeholders are examined, quantifying household savings for different scenarios of this P2P-based DG. Household energy savings are identified to be sensitive to many factors including the scale of PV systems, the PV penetration, the P2P trading margins, the presence of battery storage and energy trading time. The model shows that maximal savings up to 28% can be achieved by households equipped with larger PV systems and battery storages during weekdays from an exemplified case. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that households with PV systems have lower savings when PV penetration is high owing to excessive energy traded on the P2P market, pushing down the clearing price and the savings gain. Households with a battery-only configuration are shown to achieve fewer savings in contrast to households without any renewable resources in a P2P trading community. The model's energy insights are the beginning of understanding the actual impact of policy, market and technical signals on economic benefits for household distributed renewable generation in a P2P energy trading market."

"Continuing the precedent: Financially disadvantaging young people in ""unprecedented"" COVID-19 times Job Insecurity; Personnel; Perceived Employability The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health and an economic crisis. Economically, lockdowns across Australia have devastated business and industry, creating immediate spikes in under- and unemployment. These impacts intersect with the precarious labour market of casualised and ""gig"" economy work, where young workers constitute an established and substantial group. While negatively impacting upon many young peopleâ€™s lives, in recent decades precarious employment has also been normalised for young people as they are encouraged to understand themselves as self-reliant and entrepreneurial in their working lives. Yet, these workers have been largely abandoned in the governmentâ€™s economic response to COVID-19. The economic impact and government response to the pandemic substantially disadvantage young people. This article analyses the impact of new government initiatives: the ""JobKeeper"" wage subsidy scheme, ""JobSeeker"" payments and early access to superannuation, ""JobMaker"" economic recovery plan and the redesign of university fees. These initiatives compound preexisting youth policy of low welfare levels, youth wages and high university fees to economically burden young people. Contrasting the repeated expression of anything pandemic related as ""unprecedented"", we argue that the economic abandonment of young people in the immediate COVID-19 crisis continues a decades-long precedent in Australia of economically disadvantaging young people."

"Petrol prices and obesity Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Using 13 waves of longitudinal data from Australia, we examine the relationship between petrol prices and obesity. Applying panel data models that control for individual fixed effects and the endogeneity of petrol prices, our results suggest that petrol prices have a negative effect on obesity. Specifically, our preferred instrumental variable estimates, which instrument for petrol prices using the Arca Oil Stock price and control for individual and time fixed effects, suggest that a standard deviation increase in petrol prices generates a 0.006 standard deviation decline in body mass index, while a unit increase in petrol prices results in a 2 percentage point decrease in the probability that a survey participant is obese. These results are robust to several sensitivity checks. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that our results imply that a permanent $1 per liter increase in petrol prices would reduce the number of people who were obese by 672,000 and save $1.4 billion dollars in medical expenditure related to obesity every year. We also find that frequency of participation in physical activity and expenditure on meals eaten out are channels through which petrol prices affect obesity."
"A Review of the Performance and Benefits of Mass Timber as an Alternative to Concrete and Steel for Improving the Sustainability of Structures Cross Laminated Timber; Rigidity; Mass Timber The construction industry represents one of the greatest contributors to atmospheric emissions of CO2 and anthropogenic climate change, largely resulting from the production of commonly used building materials such as steel and concrete. It is well understood that the extraction and manufacture of these products generates significant volumes of greenhouse gases and, therefore, this industry represents an important target for reducing emissions. One possibility is to replace emissions-intensive, non-renewable materials with more environmentally friendly alternatives that minimise resource depletion and lower emissions. Although timber has not been widely used in mid-to high-rise buildings since the industrial revolution, recent advances in manufacturing have reintroduced wood as a viable product for larger and more complex structures. One of the main advantages of the resurgence of wood is its environmental performance; however, there is still uncertainty about how mass timber works and its suitability relative to key performance criteria for construction material selection. Consequently, the aim of this study is to help guide decision making in the construction sector by providing a comprehensive review of the research on mass timber. Key performance criteria for mass timber are reviewed, using existing literature, and compared with those for typical concrete construction. The review concludes that mass timber is superior to concrete and steel when taking into consideration all performance factors, and posits that the construction industry should, where appropriate, transition to mass timber as the low-carbon, high performance building material of the future."
"Potential fluoride exposure from selected food crops grown in high fluoride soils in the Makueni County, south-eastern Kenya Fluorides; Pollution; Euphausia Superba Makueni County, located in south-eastern Kenya, faces challenges such as limited potable water and restricted food supplies as the result of semi-aridity. High fluoride (F) concentrations have been reported in drinking water with resultant dental fluorosis affecting the local population. To determine the potential F exposure through the consumption of food crops grown in the area, F concentration was assessed in the main five locally grown and consumed crops. Additionally, the water-soluble F fraction was determined from 30 soil samples with mineralogical determination of 20 samples. Mean F concentration in the food crops was in the order; 700, 288, 71.2, 36.6, and 29 mg/kg in kale, cowpeas leaves, green grams, cowpeas (legume portion), and maize, respectively. The F concentration in farm soils ranged from 0 to 3.47 mg/kg (mean of 0.87 mg/kg) and showed a significant strong positive correlation (p = 0.03, r = 0.89) with F values in the crops. Apatite, muscovite, and biotite were identified as the F-rich minerals present. While considering two hypothetical F absorption fractions (75 and 100%), the estimated average daily dose (EADD) of F from consuming the crops ranged between 0.004 and 65.17 mg/kg/day where the highest values were from the vegetables. Most of these values were higher than the F reference dose (RfD) of 0.06 mg/kg. The estimated EADD values of several hypothetical meals prepared from the analyzed crops revealed that steamed kale and maize porridge pose the highest health risk of F associated diseases to the local population, whereas boiled cowpeas pose no health risk. Children, due to their higher daily energy requirement and low body weight, were the most vulnerable group at risk of high daily F intake relative to the RfD. These results suggest that consumption of the analyzed food crops in Makueni County may significantly contribute to F related diseases in the local population. This creates a food security issue for the area because of the potential health risks associated with these crops which are highly relied upon in the semi-arid area with a limited selection of food crops available and viable to grow."

"Governing urban greening at a metropolitan scale: an analysis of the Living Melbourne strategy Urban Biodiversity; Urbanization; Birds As Australian cities face challenges of increased size, density and a range of environmental issues, compounded by climate change impacts, integration of greening is receiving increased attention. Greening, in the form of parks, gardens, waterways, water-sensitive designs and green roofs, contributes to liveability, sustainability and resilience, and habitat for non-human species. Local governments are responsible for the day-to-day management of much of Australiaâ€™s urban public spaces and are developing strategies for these areas. However, local-scale planning risks piecemeal, uncoordinated and ineffective approaches, particularly for biophysical systems that have little relationship with municipal boundaries. How can a metropolitan-scale approach be applied to green space planning and governance? This paper presents a case study of Living Melbourne metropolitan urban forest strategy, developed by Nature Conservancy and Resilient Melbourne. Resilient Melbourne brings together Melbourneâ€™s 32 local governments to plan and advocate at the metropolitan scale. While the Living Melbourne strategy provides a metropolitan-scale approach, questions of governance, including how the strategy will be implemented and how local context is understood, are highlighted. Further, in developing a metropolitan-scale approach, how are the voices of local communities included? The paper analyses who is governing Melbourneâ€™s urban greening, and the benefits and risks of a metropolitan-scale approach."
"Effects of acute and chronic exercise on immunological parameters in the elderly aged: Can physical activity counteract the effects of aging? Secretory Immunoglobulin; Exercise; Mucosal Immunity Immunosenescence is characterized by deterioration of the immune system caused by aging which induces changes to innate and adaptive immunity. Immunosenescence affects function and phenotype of immune cells, such as expression and function of receptors for immune cells which contributes to loss of immune function (chemotaxis, intracellular killing). Moreover, these alterations decrease the response to pathogens, which leads to several age-related diseases including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes in older individuals. Furthermore, increased risk of autoimmune disease and chronic infection is increased with an aging immune system, which is characterized by a pro-inflammatory environment, ultimately leading to accelerated biological aging. During the last century, sedentarism rose dramatically, with a concomitant increase in certain type of cancers (such as breast cancer, colon, or prostate cancer), and autoimmune disease. Numerous studies on physical activity and immunity, with focus on special populations (i.e., people with diabetes, HIV patients) demonstrate that chronic exercise enhances immunity. However, the majority of previous work has focused on either a pathological population or healthy young adults whilst research in elderly populations is scarce. Research conducted to date has primarily focused on aerobic and resistance exercise training and its effect on immunity. This review focuses on the potential for exercise training to affect the aging immune system. The concept is that some lifestyle strategies such as high-intensity exercise training may prevent disease through the attenuation of immunosenescence. In this context, we take a top-down approach and review the effect of exercise and training on immunological parameters in elderly at rest and during exercise in humans, and how they respond to different modes of training. We highlight the impact of these different exercise modes on immunological parameters, such as cytokine and lymphocyte concentration in elderly individuals."

"Social Work and the Sustainable Development Goals: A Student Placement Model Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations The United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a blueprint to address urgent global challenges, with a clear role for social workers. This paper explores a Sustainable Development Goalâ€™s focused student placement at the Australian Association of Social Workers, with RMIT University. Students reviewed the AASWâ€™s policy actions and their contribution to the SDGs, including recommendations for future work. The review identified advocacy in key areas, and the need for action on several issues, including climate action. Students learned about social work policy, practice, and sustainability. The placement itself provides a model for other organisations to align their actions to the SDGs. IMPLICATIONS There is a need for greater social work engagement with the United Nationsâ€™ SDGs to address urgent social and environmental challenges. Field education placements can provide an important opportunity for students to learn about sustainability, social work policy practice, and the SDGs. The placement model proposed in the article is suitable for any organisation that seeks to review their actions and better align their work to the SDGs."
"Corporate Social Responsibility, Public Relations and Community Engagement: Emerging Perspectives from South East Asia Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy Diverse in economic development, political and mass media systems, the countries in Southeast Asia cast a unique light on the parallels between development-cum-participative communication and corporate social responsibility. In our globalized environments, knowledge of power, culture and the colonial histories that influence and shape business and governance practices are increasingly important. Focusing on six countries-Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam-the book discusses how public relations (PR) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) discourse are constructed, interpreted, communicated and enacted in this diverse emerging region. By connecting the disparate disciplines of participatory and development communication with PR and CSR discourse, this innovative text explores the tensions between concepts of modernity and traditional values and their role in engendering creativity, compliance or resistance. This book will be of interest to researchers, educators and advanced students in the fields of public relations, communication, corporate social responsibility, corporate communications and Southeast Asia studies."

"Simulation can offer a sustainable contribution to clinical education in osteopathy Debriefing; Clinical Competence; Deliberate Practice Background: Clinical education forms a substantial component of health professional education. Increased cohorts in Australian osteopathic education have led to consideration of alternatives to traditional placements to ensure adequate clinical exposure and learning opportunities. Simulated learning offers a new avenue for sustainable clinical education. The aim of the study was to explore whether directed observation of simulated scenarios, as part replacement of clinical hours, could provide an equivalent learning experience as measured by performance in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Methods: The year 3 osteopathy cohort were invited to participate in replacement of 50% of their clinical placement hours with online facilitated, video-based simulation exercises (intervention). Competency was assessed by an OSCE at the end of the teaching period. Inferential statistics were used to explore any differences between the control and intervention groups as a post-test control design. Results: The funding model allowed ten learners to participate in the intervention, with sixty-six in the control group. Only one OSCE item was significantly different between groups, that being technique selection (p = 0.038, d = 0.72) in favour of the intervention group, although this may be a type 1 error. Grade point average was moderately positively correlated with the manual therapy technique station total score (r = 0.35, p < 0.01) and a trivial relationship with the treatment reasoning station total score (r = 0.17, p = 0.132). Conclusions: The current study provides support for further investigation into part replacement of clinical placements with directed observation of simulated scenarios in osteopathy."

"Functional analysis of pristine estuarine marine sediments Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus Traditional environmental monitoring techniques are well suited to resolving acute exposure effects but lack resolution in determining subtle shifts in ecosystem functions resulting from chronic exposure(s). Surveillance with sensitive omics-based technologies could bridge this gap but, to date, most omics-based environmental studies have focused on previously degraded environments, identifying key metabolic differences resulting from anthropogenic perturbations. Here, we apply omics-based approaches to pristine environments to establish blueprints of microbial functionality within healthy estuarine sediment communities. We collected surface sediments (n = 50) from four pristine estuaries along the Western Cape York Peninsula of Far North Queensland, Australia. Sediment microbiomes were analyzed for 16S rRNA amplicon sequences, central carbon metabolism metabolites and associated secondary metabolites via targeted and untargeted metabolic profiling methods. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated heterogeneity among all the sampled estuaries, however, taxa-function relationships could be established that predicted community metabolism potential. Twenty-four correlated gene-metabolite pathways were identified and used to establish sediment microbial blueprints of essential carbon metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis that were positively correlated with community metabolic function outputs (2-oxisocapraote, tryptophan, histidine citrulline and succinic acid). In addition, an increase in the 125 KEGG genes related to metal homeostasis and metal resistance was observed, although, none of the detected metabolites related to these specific genes upon integration. However, there was a correlation between metal abundance and functional genes related to Fe and Zn metabolism. Our results establish a baseline microbial blueprint for the pristine sediment microbiome, one that drives important ecosystem services and to which future ecosurveillance monitoring can be compared."

"Image-Based Sexual Abuse: Online Distribution Channels and Illicit Communities of Support Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica This article investigates the nature and scope of image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) material on 77 high-volume online websites. On the majority of these sites, users appeared to be motivated by sexual gratification and proving masculinity to a sexually deviant peer network, rather than revenge against the person depicted in the image. We argue that nonconsensual image exchanges are contextualized within ever-expanding digital environments, characterized by dislocation of time and space, overvisualization, and hypersexuality. We argue that IBSA is a vehicle for the construction, performativity, and negotiation of hypermasculinity and heteronormativity, within the bounds and structures of existing gendered power relations."
"OER based capacity building to overcome staff equity and access issues in higher education University Teacher; Professional Development; Academic Staff Open educational resources (OER) have already impacted educational systems around the world. In higher education more specifically, it has benefited learners, and has influenced institutional strategic plans and policies. Additionally, the benefits of OER also extend to staff in higher education, such as academic staff. For this group, OER can provide opportunities for collaboration, promote curriculum innovation and student led content development, as well as contribute to university teachers' much needed continuing professional development. In this paper, we examine the potential of OER to build capacity of academic staff in higher education, in particular to overcome some equity and access issues that they may face. It also examines some existing activities and strategies for professional developmen in higher educational institutions and provides some recommendations for academics, academic developers, institutions, and the sector in general."

"Transcriptome profiling of lentil (Lens culinaris) through the first 24 hours of Ascochyta lentis infection reveals key defence response genes Genetic Variability; Ascochyta Lentis; Breeding Programs Background: Ascochyta blight, caused by the fungus Ascochyta lentis, is one of the most destructive lentil diseases worldwide, resulting in over $16 million AUD annual loss in Australia alone. The use of resistant cultivars is currently considered the most effective and environmentally sustainable strategy to control this disease. However, little is known about the genes and molecular mechanisms underlying lentil resistance against A. lentis. Results: To uncover the genetic basis of lentil resistance to A. lentis, differentially expressed genes were profiled in lentil plants during the early stages of A. lentis infection. The resistant 'ILL7537' and susceptible 'ILL6002' lentil genotypes were examined at 2, 6, and 24 h post inoculation utilising high throughput RNA-Sequencing. Genotype and time-dependent differential expression analysis identified genes which play key roles in several functions of the defence response: fungal elicitors recognition and early signalling; structural response; biochemical response; transcription regulators; hypersensitive reaction and cell death; and systemic acquired resistance. Overall, the resistant genotype displayed an earlier and faster detection and signalling response to the A. lentis infection and demonstrated higher expression levels of structural defence-related genes. Conclusions: This study presents a first-time defence-related transcriptome of lentil to A. lentis, including a comprehensive characterisation of the molecular mechanism through which defence against A. lentis is induced in the resistant lentil genotype."
"The co-application of biochar with bioremediation for the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from contaminated soil Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Soil pollution from petroleum hydrocarbon is a global environmental problem that could contribute to the non-actualisation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Several techniques have been used to remediate petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soils; however, there are technical and economical limitations to existing methods. As such, the development of new approaches and the improvement of existing techniques are imperative. Biochar, a low-cost carbonaceous product of the thermal decomposition of waste biomass has gained relevance in soil remediation. Biochar has been applied to remediate hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, with positive and negative results reported. Consequently, attempts have been made to improve the performance of biochar in the hydrocarbon-based remediation process through the co-application of biochar with other bioremediation techniques as well as modifying biochar properties before use. Despite the progress made in this domain, there is a lack of a detailed single review consolidating the critical findings, new developments, and challenges in biochar-based remediation of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soil. This review assessed the potential of biochar co-application with other well-known bioremediation techniques such as bioaugmentation, phytoremediation, and biostimulation. Additionally, the benefits of modification in enhancing biochar suitability for bioremediation were examined. It was concluded that biochar co-application generally resulted in higher hydrocarbon removal than sole biochar treatment, with up to a 4-fold higher removal observed in some cases. However, most of the biochar co-applied treatments did not result in hydrocarbon removal that was greater than the additive effects of individual treatment. Overall, compared to their complementary treatments, biochar co-application with bioaugmentation was more beneficial in hydrocarbon removal than biochar co-application with either phytoremediation or biostimulation. Future studies should integrate the ecotoxicological and cost implications of biochar co-application for a viable remediation process. Lastly, improving the synergistic interactions of co-treatment on hydrocarbon removal is critical to capturing the full potential of biochar-based remediation."

"Communal area design in apartment buildings: development and comparison of a desktop and on-the-ground landscape assessment tool Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians In the context of global urbanisation, creating high-density living environments that promote health, wellbeing and social connectedness is vital. In apartment buildings, residents live in close physical proximity and share communal areas, however not all areas are equal in design and quality, which may impact usage and residentsâ€™ social connections. We developed and compared an on-the-ground and desktop/remote observation approach to auditing indoor and outdoor communal area design and quality. The Communal Areas Audit Tool (CAAT) and Communal Areas Desktop Audit Tool (CADAT), which measured design features that can impact residents use of (and interaction within) communal areas, were assessed for reliability and validity. Of the 77 CAAT items, 69 demonstrated moderate to almost perfect reliability. The CADAT included 57 CAAT items assessed using secondary data sources (architectural plans; online photographs; Google Earth imagery) and was validated by comparing the desktop and on-the-ground audit results. Only one CADAT item demonstrated poor agreement. The CADAT was a more time-efficient, inexpensive tool that bypassed the difficulties of accessing private buildings. Although it excluded items only auditable in person, its use is more practical for large-scale studies investigating high-density apartments and residentsâ€™ social outcomes, which is increasingly important to consider given urban densification."

"Losing the authority–what institutional architecture for cooperative governance in the Murray Darling Basin? Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Water governance strongly depends on the institutional arrangements in place. The plethora of recent inquiries into the adequacy and integrity of governance arrangements in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) indicates a crisis of trust, legitimacy and public confidenceâ€“in short, a loss of authority. With the prospect that current arrangements are losing the authority and legitimacy needed to govern the Basin, pressure is mounting for further reforms due to scandals exposed in the media throughout 2017 and 2018. These and subsequent inquiries have revealed serious concerns about probity, integrity, maladministration and the adequacy of compliance and enforcement regimes. The productive potential of this crisis is that draws attention to the need for reforms to governance institutions. This paper aims to explore the redesign of the institutional architecture in the MDB. Given the profound challenges of social and climate change that are demanding reconsideration of the underlying models used in adaptively governing large complex socio-ecological systems, the paper asks what arrangements are suited to the challenges of governing the Basin in the 21st century? This paper explores the nature of the redesign challenge, exploring principles, practices and features of MDB governance. The need for institutions with capacity for strategic navigation, goal seeking and the cultural co-construction of authority are suggested in the interests of cultivating debate about prospective reorganisation."

"Network Remote Powering through Quasi-Passive Optical Nodes The Internet has been deployed world widely using optical networks and it has significantly changed our daily lives in the past decade. However, providing network connections to remote areas remains challenging. One of the major limitations for remote access is the powering of remote optical network nodes, where the local power supply for network infrastructure may not be available. This project aims to solve this key limitation to provide reliable and broadband network access to remote areas through innovative low power consumption optical network nodes and the remote powering of these network nodes. The novel network node to be realised in this project is quasi-passive, and it does not consume any power under static network connections. When network reconfiguration is needed according to changing traffic and network conditions, the power required for the node reconfiguration will be remotely delivered using the same traffic transmission optical fibre. The principle and feasibility of such quasi-passive nodes and remote powering have been verified in our recent preliminary study, and this project will focus on the further investigation, optimisation and proof-of-concept experimental demonstrations of such node and the remote powering technology. The outcomes of this project will eliminate local power supply requirements in remote network nodes, to significantly facilitate reliable and high-speed Internet access in remote areas and remote communities."
"Deep-water cirripedes colonizing dead shells of the cephalopod Nautilus macromphalus from New Caledonian waters Ammonite; Shell; Cephalopoda Fossil cephalopods are frequently encrusted by epibionts; however, determining whether encrustation occurred prior to or post-mortem to the host, and whether the final environment of deposition corresponds to the habitat of encrustation is complex. The present paper describes cirripede epibionts, their calcareous bases and their attachment scars on 6 post-mortem shells of Nautilus macromphalus, collected from deep water off New Caledonia. The cirripedes have left both cemented calcareous bases of Hexelasma and scars associated with bioerosion and discoloration produced by verrucomorph barnacles. Live cirripedes included a Metaverruca recta, with articulated opercular plates and organic tissue (on a shell that had been exposed on the sea floor for at least 150 years), and specimens of Hexelasma velutinum, one of which was partly attached to an internal surface of a shell. The disposition of verrucomorphs indicates that most Nautilus shells were colonized post-mortem rather than during a floating stage. However, as cirripedes are known to have colonized living Nautilus, some Hexelasma, preserved only as calcareous eroded bases, may represent specimens that settled on a living Nautilus. The degree of bioerosion and discoloration induced by verrucomorph barnacles varies according to the surface preservation of Nautilus shells, with deeper and discolored traces preserved on old and degraded shells. Traces made by verrucomorphs described here are ellipsoidal and a new ichnotaxon, Anellusichnus ellipticus, is proposed to accommodate them. Importantly, verrucomorphs and other cirripede taxa with membranous bases that were attached to pristine shells may not leave any substantial scars, and, thus, will be difficult to detect in the fossil record."

"Population- and sex-specific sensitivity of the marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa to metal exposure Gammarus Fossarum; Potamopyrgus Antipodarum; Bioassay The sensitivity to contaminants of natural populations varies greatly depending on their historical exposure and on the sex of the individual. These factors result in great uncertainty in ecotoxicological risk assessments and challenge the protection of marine biodiversity. This study investigated the role of background pollution in the environment in shaping the sensitivity of males and females of the common marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa to the common trace marine pollutant, copper (Cu). Female and male amphipods were collected from two sites: Geelong (the polluted site) and Clifton Springs (the clean site). Amphipods were exposed to Cu treatments of 0, 50, 100, and 250 Î¼g/L for 10 days, followed by a 10-day recovery period. Cu-exposed males from Geelong showed a reduction in feeding rate at a higher Cu concentration than males from Clifton Springs, suggesting that they have a higher tolerance to Cu than males from Clifton Springs. This can be explained by their higher base level of metallothioneins (MTs) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), the key physiological responses for detoxification and defence against damages from Cu toxicity. Males showed a higher tolerance to Cu than females. This pattern was similar in both populations, which may be associated with a higher level of GST. During the recovery period, only males from Geelong fully recovered to the control level. Our results emphasize the importance of considering population- and sex-specific sensitivity of invertebrates to contaminants in ecotoxicological risk assessments."
"Study on the Carbon Footprint Reduction Through Recycling Activities in UTHM: Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic ARIMA; Mathematical Modeling; COVID-19 Recycling is an excellent method to manage institutional solid waste and reduce the environmental carbon footprint. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented chaos and affected recycling activities in UTHM. Therefore, the trend of carbon reduction through recycling activities in UTHM was determined to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the trend of carbon reduction. The data was collected from the recycling center in UTHM and the carbon reduction was further calculated to compare the difference before and after the pandemic outbreak. The weight of paper products collected was the highest, accounting for more than 75%, while the weight of aluminium collected was the lowest, accounting for less than 1%. Furthermore, it was found that the trend of carbon reduction increased steadily in 2019. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused the trend to plunge and approach zero in March 2020. Nevertheless, once the COVID-19 pandemic was under control, the carbon reduction trend improved and peaked again in 2021. In addition, paper products achieved the highest of the total carbon reduction at 5143.072 tCO2e while aluminium was the lowest at 0.357 tCO2e. The highest total carbon reduction was achieved in 2019 with 1980.168 tCO2e while the lowest was recorded in 2020 with 1220.932 tCO2e.

"Effective biodiversity behaviour change across supply chains Consumption of resources is the major driver of biodiversity loss yet understanding of how to change behavioural
drivers is lacking. This project aims to understand barriers to biodiversity behaviours across a supply chain, how
to overcome them and increase positive biodiversity impact via spillover effects. We will use coffee as a case
study to test specific interventions, design effective message frames for reducing the psychological distance of
consumption behaviours and develop a framework for generalising to other behaviours impacting biodiversity. The
project is expected to generate new knowledge and approaches critical for policy makers and other actors seeking
to reduce consumptive impacts on biodiversity."
"Developing disaster resilience: A processual and reflective approach Tourist; Destination Image; Risk Perception This study takes a processual view of resilience to investigate how tourism organisations utilise dynamic capabilities to develop resilience in a disaster context. A longitudinal qualitative research design was used to gain insights into the process. The study uses on-site observation, secondary documents, and in-depth interviews with representatives from 25 tourism organisations and industry stakeholders across two years to provide a longitudinal understanding of disaster resilience. A dynamic resilience framework is developed based on three dynamic capability steps (sensing, seizing, transforming) and helps to explain how tourism organisations develop resilience elements at each disaster management stage. Two notable contributions include (i) a new resilience element added to the existing list of resilience development, which illustrates disruptive changes of tourism facilitated by transforming dynamic capabilities, and (ii) a trial-and-error process used by tourism organisations to improve decision-making for future disaster events. These help to explain the cyclical nature of resilience building."
"Permittivity Sensor Based on a Slow-Wave Artificial Transmission Line Ring Resonator; Sensor; Metamaterials A slow-wave periodic artificial transmission line implemented by means of dumbbell-shaped defect ground structures (DB-DGS) is applied to the implementation of a phase variation permittivity sensor. Due to the dispersion characteristic of these lines, the sensitivity of the phase with the dielectric constant of the material under test (MUT) can be improved, as compared to the one of conventional lines. This sensitivity improvement is demonstrated in this work through full-wave electromagnetic simulations."

"Epidemiological investigation of Spotty Liver Disease in chickens to inform disease control Spotty Liver Disease (SLD) is an emerging disease in the layer industry in Australia. It is causing significant egg production losses and mortality (1). Our group recently identified the cause of the disease, Campylobacter hepaticus, and developed molecular tools to detect the organism  in clinical samples (2). This project?s aim  is to investigate bacterial infection and spread within flocks and identify possible transmission routes in layer farms by investigating the presence of the bacterium in environmental samples. The findings will assist in defining appropriate biosecurity measures and will help in flock and environmental management to reduce the impact of SLD."

"Social Capital Inequality and Subjective Wellbeing of Older Chinese Subjective Well-Being; Happiness; Life Satisfaction Using longitudinal data from the China Family Panel Studies, this study provides insights on comparative wellbeing outcomes for older people who are institutionally segregated into clusters that produce uneven social capital. We present the first study that examines how institutionalized social capital inequality, measured by the social capital gap generated by hukou (household registration) status in China, affects the wellbeing of older people. Our results show that high levels of social capital inequality are associated with lower subjective wellbeing, measured by life satisfaction. This general conclusion is robust to a number of sensitivity checks including alternative ways of measuring subjective wellbeing and inequality. We also find that the negative relationship between social capital inequality and subjective wellbeing is strongest for people with a non-urban hukou living in urban areas. Our findings highlight the need for policies aimed at narrowing the social capital gap and the dismantling of institutional structures that hinder upward social capital mobility."

"Laser-Induced µ-Rooms for Osteocytes on Implant Surface: An In Vivo Study Resonance Frequency Analysis; Osseointegration; Implant Laser processing of dental implant surfaces is becoming a more widespread replacement for classical techniques due to its undeniable advantages, including control of oxide formation and structure and surface relief at the microscale. Thus, using a laser, we created several biomimetic topographies of various shapes on the surface of titanium screw-shaped implants to research their success and survival rates. A distinctive feature of the topographies is the presence of â€œÂµ-roomsâ€, which are special spaces created by the depressions and elevations and are analogous to the Âµ-sized room in which the osteocyte will potentially live. We conducted the comparable in vivo study using dental implants with continuous (G-topography with Âµ-canals), discrete (S-topography with Î¼-cavities), and irregular (I-topography) laser-induced topographies. A histological analysis performed with the statistical method (with p-value less than 0.05) was conducted, which showed that G-topography had the highest BIC parameter and contained the highest number of mature osteocytes, indicating the best secondary stability and osseointegration."
"Using metabolomics to assess the sub-lethal effects of zinc and boscalid on an estuarine polychaete worm over time Homarine; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Daphnia Magna Introduction: Zinc is a heavy metal commonly detected in urban estuaries around Australia. Boscalid is a fungicide found in estuaries, both in water and sediment, it enters the system predominantly through agricultural run-off. Zinc is persistent while boscalid breaks down, with a half-life of 108 days. Both contaminants are widely distributed and their effects on ecosystems are not well understood. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the metabolite changes in Simplisetia aequisetis (an estuarine polychaete) following laboratory exposure to a sub-lethal concentration of zinc or boscalid over a 2-week period. Methods: Individuals were collected at six time points over a 2-week period. Whole polychaete metabolites were extracted and quantified using a multi-platform approach. Polar metabolites were detected using a semi-targeted GCâ€“MS analysis and amine containing compounds were analysed using a targeted LCâ€“MS analysis. Total lipid energy content was also analysed for Simplisetia aequisetis. Results: The pathways that responded to zinc and boscalid exposure were alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism (AAG); glycine, serine and threonine metabolism (GST) and metabolites associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Results showed that changes in total abundance of some metabolites could be detected as early as 24-h exposure. Changes were detected in the metabolites before commonly used total lipid energy assays identified effects. Conclusion: A multi-platform approach provided a holistic overview of the metabolomic response to contaminants in polychaetes. This approach shows promise to be used in biomonitoring programs to provide early diagnostic indicators of contamination and exposure."

"Policing repeat and high-risk family violence: police and service-sector perceptions of a coordinated model Domestic Violence; Intimate Partner Violence; Police Family violence forms a significant part of police-work, with many police agencies adopting evolving responses to family violence over time. This article presents the qualitative findings of a mixed-method evaluation of â€˜Alexisâ€™, a coordinated police-social-services approach to family violence piloted in the state of Victoria, Australia. In-depth interviews were conducted with 14 stakeholders (7 police members and 7 community service providers) to examine perceptions of how the model was working and how it differed from other policing approaches to family violence. Five key themes were extracted from the data via thematic analysis: (i) collaboration between police, an embedded family violence worker and other agencies; (ii) increased police accountability; (iii) adoption of a proactive major crime approach; (iv) emphasis on professional development; and (v) the allocation of dedicated time and resources. Implications for future policy development are discussed, with the findings highlighting promising practices for policing high-risk and recidivist family violence."

"Observations of phase changes in monoolein during high viscous injection X-Ray Laser; Crystallography; Serials Serial crystallography of membrane proteins often employs high-viscosity injectors (HVIs) to deliver micrometre-sized crystals to the X-ray beam. Typically, the carrier medium is a lipidic cubic phase (LCP) media, which can also be used to nucleate and grow the crystals. However, despite the fact that the LCP is widely used with HVIs, the potential impact of the injection process on the LCP structure has not been reported and hence is not yet well understood. The self-assembled structure of the LCP can be affected by pressure, dehydration and temperature changes, all of which occur during continuous flow injection. These changes to the LCP structure may in turn impact the results of X-ray diffraction measurements from membrane protein crystals. To investigate the influence of HVIs on the structure of the LCP we conducted a study of the phase changes in monoolein/water and monoolein/buffer mixtures during continuous flow injection, at both atmospheric pressure and under vacuum. The reservoir pressure in the HVI was tracked to determine if there is any correlation with the phase behaviour of the LCP. The results indicated that, even though the reservoir pressure underwent (at times) significant variation, this did not appear to correlate with observed phase changes in the sample stream or correspond to shifts in the LCP lattice parameter. During vacuum injection, there was a three-way coexistence of the gyroid cubic phase, diamond cubic phase and lamellar phase. During injection at atmospheric pressure, the coexistence of a cubic phase and lamellar phase in the monoolein/water mixtures was also observed. The degree to which the lamellar phase is formed was found to be strongly dependent on the co-flowing gas conditions used to stabilize the LCP stream. A combination of laboratory-based optical polarization microscopy and simulation studies was used to investigate these observations."

"Assessing agricultural drought management strategies in the Northern Murray–Darling Basin Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China The Northern Murrayâ€“Darling Basin (MDB) is a key Australian agricultural region requiring efficient Agricultural Drought Management (ADM), focused on resilience. Although a need for resilience in local farming communities has long been recognised, previous studies assessing ADM in the Northern MDB did not consider two key elements of resilient management: proactivity (preparing for drought prior to a drought event) and suitability (localised drought management targeted at decision-makers). This study assessed the current ADM Strategy (ADMS) implemented within five selected Northern MDB Local Government Areas (LGAs) (Paroo Shire, Balonne Shire, Murweh Shire, Maranoa Region, and Goondiwindi Region), specifically investigating the extent of ADMS proactivity, effectiveness, and suitability. To investigate suitability, drought risk extent of each LGA was determined. A region-specific drought risk index consisting of hazard, vulnerability and exposure indices was developed; risk mapping was conducted. All LGAs displayed very high levels of drought risk due to hazardous climatic conditions, vulnerable socio-economic attributes, and drought-exposed geographical features. A Criteria-Based Ranking (CBR) survey produced a quantitative effectiveness and proactivity rank for each major ADMS used in the Northern MDB. Government Assistance was the most proactive and effective ADMS. Strategy effectiveness ranks of the major ADMS used and drought risk extent found in each LGA were correlated to determine ADMS suitability. Overall, Balonne Shire and the Goondiwindi Region were identified as high priority areas requiring improved ADM. A user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought could potentially increase ADM proactivity and suitability in such areas, strengthening drought resilience of farming communities."

"Design of green spaces for biodiversity in cities My research aims to understand how green space design can lead to positive biodiversity outcomes using an ecological network approach. My fieldwork has been specifically targeted to assess how animals interact with existing green space design features, and how these interactions change in different contexts. I propose to collect temporally replicated plantpollinator interaction data in a representative sample of Melbourne?s green spaces, and will use a robust combination of observation and molecular techniques to characterise and quantify network structure and function. This approach has not previously been explored in urban areas. My project will, therefore, provide valuable baseline data on the functioning of urban ecosystems as well as practical recommendations for the design and management of green spaces in cities."

"A review on process and practices in operation and design modification of ejectors Ejectors; Cold Chain; Heat Pump Systems This work reviews the current operational condition and activities on design modification for different applications of ejectors. Ejectors being a simple mechanical system capable of perform-ing multiple fluid related functions (vacuum generation, pumping, mixing, condensing and heat exchanging), have been an essential part of several industrial processes. Two areas have been em-phasized; internal flow and application-based modifications in components of ejectors. The geometry and inlet flow conditions were found to be the prime influencing factor of its performance. The objective and application-based modifications were performed on the primary nozzle, secondary nozzle, mixing chamber, throat and diffuser. The resultant performance was found to be dependent on operational condition and fluid type. This emphasizes the requirement of application-based design selection of the technology. In addition, the flow dynamics of condensing, non-condensing, particle and slurry flow has been studied based on available literatures. The one-point final objective is to identify the usability of primary water jet ejectors for active vapor transport and condensation, to replace vacuum pump and condenser in compact domestic water desalination system."

"Towards a framework for critical social marketing: what is to be done for emancipation? Social Marketing; Wicked Problems; Marketers In this paper, we aim to theoretically advance critical social marketing (CSM). Our purpose is to advance a guiding ethos for the disparate corpus of CSM scholarship and encourage social marketers to become more critically informed in their research and practice. We introduce a critically reflexive, decolonising, intersectional, and trauma-informed CSM framework for social marketing theory, research, and practice towards emancipatory behaviour and social change. Our framework is applied in the context of the social problem of child labour. We then discuss and offer conclusions of the implications of our CSM framework, provide suggestions for a future research agenda that challenges scholars to engage in critically informed research and practice in social marketing."
"Photocatalytic Activity of Carbon Nanotube/Zinc Oxide Nanocomposite for Solar Energy Based Water Treatment and Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting Photocatalytic Activity; Zinc Oxide; Zinc Acetate Fluorine doped Tin Oxide (FTO) was used as the substrate for the synthesis of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes/Zinc Oxide nanorods composites. The first composite was a layer-by-layer sample of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes/Zinc Oxide nanorods and the second was a mixed sample of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes/Zinc Oxide nanorods. Characterisation techniques including XRD, FE-SEM and UV-Visible spectroscopy were performed on both the composites to investigate the diffraction peaks, morphology and band gap energy, respectively. Dye degradation and Photoeletrochemical (PEC) performance of both the composites were studied and the results proved that the photocatalytic activity and the photoelectrochemical performance were improved by the incorporation of MWCNT with ZnO nanorods. The highest dye degradation of 64.44% and 39.57% under UV and AM1.5G illumination and the highest photocurrent density of 1.5x10-4 A/cm2 and 8.0x10-5A/cm2 under UV and AM1.5G illumination were achieved by the MWCNT/ZnO layer-by-layer sample. This makes MWCNT/ZnO nanorods layer-by-layer sample a promising candidate for the removal of organic dyes from waste waters and for the production of Hydrogen as a source of sustainable energy by using the abundant light energy for water splitting."
"Optimisation of formulation and processing conditions for paneer manufacture Paneer is a South Asian variety of soft cheese prepared by acid and h eat coagulation of milk. It is mostly popular throughout South Asia, although there is a high demand for paneer In Australia among the vegetarians and migrated population . It i s a rich source of protein, fat, minerals and vitamins. Due to the availability or different types of milk and variation In milk composition, various techniques have been developed to produce paneer as per the requirements of the consumers with appreciable improvement in the yield and other quality characteristics . Mostly Paneer in South Asia is made using buffalo milk which h as a high content of fat and can withstand more heat. However, due to the very limited production of buffalo milk in Australia, cow's milk is the cheapest and easily sourcable milk commodity in Australia. Thus, with the use of cow's milk, the paneer preparation process needs to be optimised to achieve the desired textural, taste and quality that the consumers are looking for. The optimisation of the heating temperatures, acidulants used and duration of the treatments is necessary without comprising the qualities of traditional paneer."

"The “Gender Agenda” in Agriculture for Development and Its (Lack of) Alignment With Feminist Scholarship Farmers; Women in Agriculture; Farm Families Sustainable food systems require sustainable agriculture. To achieve this, we argue, inclusive approaches are required that incorporate the voices and lived experiences of diverse social groups. In agriculture-based international development efforts (known as Agriculture for Development or A4D), it is increasingly being recognized that sustainable agriculture requires attention to gendered power relations. In the past, gender inequality has been a major barrier to developing inclusive, sustainable food systems, and continues to be so today. At the same time, however, gender is increasingly â€œon the agendaâ€ in A4D. Yet what sort of agenda is being promoted and to what extent does it reflect progress in feminist scholarship? We examine the burgeoning â€œgender agendaâ€ through the lens of policy materials produced by prominent A4D organizations. In doing so, we find problematic narratives that instrumentalise women in the name of sustainable agricultural development. However, we also find other more transformative discourses that, in troubling the drivers of gender inequality and promoting shared responsibility for change, reflect a deeper awareness of feminist scholarship. In any effort to advance sustainable agriculture, further progress is needed to address the myriad ways gender pervades not just development settings but development institutions and donor nations, and contributes to the production of as well as responses to global A4D challenges."

"Paving roads with recycled plastics: Microplastic pollution or eco-friendly solution? Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens Although plastic-modified roads are a promising approach to reducing the amount of landfilled and incinerated plastic and improving asphalt pavement performance, the contribution of plastic-modified roads to microplastic pollution is unknown. This study aimed to develop a new abrasion procedure to quantify the release of microplastics from recycled plastic-modified asphalt depending on environmental factors, the type and content of plastic used, and the incorporation method in bitumen/asphalt. A Wet Track Abrasion machine was used to simulate road traffic abrasion on a plastic-modified asphalt sample, and a novel microplastic extraction procedure was designed to extract the generated microplastics. Incorporating recycled plastic as a polymer modifier in the bitumen matrix resulted in an early release of microplastics compared to its addition as a synthetic aggregate substitute in the asphalt mix. Cold temperatures and low pH values favoured the generation of microplastics from plastic-modified asphalt. Due to the lack of universal thresholds for the release of microplastics into the environment, environmental agencies and local authorities could benefit from this novel laboratory-based microplastic assessment procedure to foster the sustainable use of recycled plastic in roads."

"The leadership role of teachers and environment club coordinators in promoting ecocentrism in secondary schools: Teachers as exemplars of environmental education Deep Ecology; Sustainability; Anthropocentric This study of Naessian ecocentrism and anthropocentrism in three environment club coordinators/science teachers, their colleagues and some parents at three secondary schools uses deep ecology and relational fields as primary frameworks for open-ended interviews. The findings reveal new insights into the affective, cognitive and behavioural characteristics of coordinators who enhance environmental education in their schools. The work presents preliminary data on leadership among sustainability coordinators who run environment clubs. It fills a gap in the literature by showing that in addition to environmental educators requiring knowledge and attitudes regarding sustainability practices, affective qualities like connectedness and love for the environment may be important to their success as sustainability exemplars. Teachers emerge as sustainability exemplars in a relational field to implement sustainability across the secondary curriculum, galvanise students, teachers and parents to connect to the Earth, and help students, teachers and parents move away from anthropocentrism. Findings suggest that if schools commit resources and time to the coordinator's role, students experience significant benefits by becoming closer to the Earth and more empowered to act for the environment in ways consistent with deep ecology."

"Stealthing: a criminal offence? Criminalization; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Prosecution Non-consensual condom removal during sexual intercourse, commonly known as â€˜stealthingâ€™, presents a plethora of adverse consequences to complainants and is an emerging area of interest in the criminal law. Stealthing would require â€˜fresh consentâ€™ for intercourse to continue on a consensual basis after the condom has been removed. The substantive criminal law in Australia remains silent on the legality of non-consensual condom removal. This article will examine criminal law doctrines in Australia to determine whether stealthing would be considered to vitiate consent under the current law. This article concludes that it is unclear whether stealthing would be considered to negate consent to sexual intercourse under current consent laws in Australia. This article will ultimately propose two legislative reforms that seek to criminalise stealthing in Australia: to include stealthing as a discrete criminal offence, or to include stealthing under the current consent provisions as another circumstance where consent is deemed to be vitiated."
"It’s Elemental: Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) as scalable and sustainable student-centered practice in context University Teacher; Professional Development; Academic Staff Many educational institutions are facing the challenge of how to implement Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) in a meaningful, scalable and sustainable manner. This implementation is not a transition from change project to business as usual, but a fluid and continual narrative embraced by all that must be personalized for the diverse cohort it impacts. RMITs ongoing and evolving solution involves a combination of approaches that touch on strategic initiatives that operationalize standards (Elements) for consistency of student-centered teaching, capability building and training, resource development, technology implementations and organisational structures. This solution allows meaningful collaboration between professional and academic staff that values the interplay between learning design and discipline specific teaching practice. To operationalize this TEL solution with a focus on student-centred teaching, agile approaches have been used at RMIT. These approaches assist in placing value on people and the holistic relationship and interdependencies between the context of teaching and learning activities, and the methodologies used to enable change in practice."

"The role of microglia in mediating the neuroendocrine responses in diet-induced obesity Obesity induces inflammation, making it harder to lose weight and increasing the risk for long-term health complications. Recent data suggest microglia, the brain major immune cells, may play a key role in driving the detrimental consequences of obesity. I will test if microglia are necessary for the development of obesity. This will tell us if by targeting the neuroimmune consequences of diets high in fat, we are able to restore healthy weight and curb obesity."
"A synthetic nanoparticle based vaccine approach targeting MSP4/5 is immunogenic and induces moderate protection against murine blood-stage malaria Antibodies; Plasmodium Vivax; Malaria Vaccines Malaria remains a significant health problem in many tropical and sub-tropical regions. The development of vaccines against the clinically active blood-stage of infection needs to consider variability and polymorphism in target antigens, and an adjuvant system able to induce broad spectrum immunity comprising both antibodies and helper T cells. Moreover, recent studies have shown some conventional pro-inflammatory adjuvants can also promote expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), both of which could negatively impact malaria disease progression. Herein, we explore the ability of a model nanoparticle delivery system (polystyrene nanoparticles; PSNPs), previously proven to not induce conventional inflammation, Treg or MDSC, to induce immunity to MSP4/5 from Plasmodium yoelii, a member of the MSP4 and MSP5 family of proteins which are highly conserved across diverse malaria species including P. falciparum. The results show PSNPs-MSP4/5 conjugates are highly immunogenic, inducing immune responses comprising both T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cellular immunity, and a spectrum of antibody subclasses including IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b. Benchmarked against Alum and Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), the immune responses that were induced were of comparable or higher magnitude, for both T cell frequencies by ELISpot and antibody responses in terms of ELISA end titer. Importantly, immunization with PSNPs-MSP4/5 induced partial protection against malaria blood-stage infection (50-80%) shown to be mechanistically dependent on interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) production. These results expand the scope of adjuvants considered for malaria blood-stage vaccine development to those that do not use conventional adjuvant pathways and emphasizes the critical role of cellular immunity and specifically IFN-Î³ producing cells in providing moderate protection against blood-stage malaria comparable to Freunds adjuvant."

"The structural oppression of women by markets: the continuum of sexual violence and the online pornography market Marketing; Consumer Culture; Netnography This paper assembles emerging scholarship attendant to the marginalisation of people by market structures of power and dominance. We conceptualise this as market violence and locate one group of people largely missing from this conversation: women. To theorise womenâ€™s structural subordination in the marketplace we introduce several key tenets of radical feminist theory. Then, applying the continuum of sexual violence, we conceive markets as structures of sexual violence. Through the online pornography market, we find the market system (in producing and distributing women as commodities) is perpetrating a complex range of (often difficult to define) forms of sexual violence. We then reveal the marketâ€™s pervasiveness as a form of sexual harassment. To finish, we offer the continuum as a broader conceptualisation for future market violence scholarship."

"Minimizing the gap between expectation and ability: Strategies for smes to implement social sustainability practices Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices Traditionally, it is believed that small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not have enough ability to adopt and persistently practice social sustainability. This is because SMEs are not capital-intensive companies and neither are their returns nor skills. At the same time, the wellbeing of the employees in SMEs cannot be ensured and sustainable development goals cannot be achieved without making SMEs socially sustainable, as they account for the majority of world businesses. Moreover, the expectation of the stakeholders and subsequent pressure on SMEs to practicing social sustainability remains. Such pressure from the stakeholders creates a ""mismatch problem"" between stakeholders' expectations and SMEs' abilities to adopt socially sustainable practices. This study aims to explore what factors are responsible for this ""mismatch problem"", and how SMEs can handle this mismatch to be socially sustainable firms. Based on a rigorous literature review, this study reveals that both internal issues, such as a lack of resources and awareness, and external issues, such as the non-existence of a tailored social sustainability standard for SMEs and lack of institutional support, are responsible for this gap. This study develops several propositions that highlight the requirements in various situations and provides strategies outlining the implications for SMEs and their stakeholders to make SMEs socially sustainable. Overall, this study discloses that cooperative support from stakeholders, especially during a disruption such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a finance mechanism, the development of awareness and human capital in SMEs, and a unified standard for SMEs are likely to improve social sustainability practices in SMEs."

"Employment precarity and energy poverty in post-apartheid South Africa: Exploring the racial and ethnic dimensions Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort This study examines the link between employment precarity and energy poverty from racial and ethnic perspectives. Data are extracted from a five-year panel survey from South Africaâ€”a country noted for its high rate of racial, ethnic and gender segregation of occupations. Both employment precarity and energy poverty are measured using multidimensional indices. Our endogeneity corrected results indicate that employment precarity is associated with higher likelihoods of energy poverty, with racial and ethnic heterogeneities. These findings are consistent across different endogeneity-resolving techniques, alternative ways of capturing energy poverty, and robust to different cut-offs and weighting schemes used for the energy poverty index. Based on race, we find that employment precarity increases energy poverty more among Black South Africans compared to White/Asian/Indian/Other South Africans. Ethnically, the increasing effect of employment precarity on energy poverty is lowest among the Afrikaans/English speakers and highest among the Venda ethnic group. Labour income is identified as an important pathway through which employment precarity influences energy poverty."

"Rare earth elements (REE) for the removal and recovery of phosphorus: A review Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption There is little doubt that â€˜rock phosphateâ€™ reserves are decreasing, with phosphorus (P) peak to be reached in the coming decades. Hence, removal and recovery of phosphorus (P) from alternative nutrient-rich waste streams is critical and of great importance owing to its essential role in agricultural productivity. Adsorption technique is efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable for P recovery from waste streams which otherwise can cause eutrophication in receiving waters. As selective P sorption using rare earth elements (REE) are gaining considerable attention, this review extensively focuses on P recovery by utilising a range of REE-incorporated adsorbents. The review briefly provides existing knowledge of P in various waste streams, and examines the chemistry and behaviour of REE in soil and water in detail. The impact of interfering ions on P removal using REE, adsorbent regeneration for reuse, and life cycle assessment of REE are further explored. While it is clear that REE-sorbents have excellent potential to recover P from wastewaters and to be used as fertilisers, there are gaps to be addressed. Future studies should target recovery and reuse of REE as P fertilisers using real wastewaters. More field trials of synthesized REE-sorbents are highly recommended before practical application."

"Opportunities to reduce brick waste disposal Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management Brick is a widely used construction material in the Australian construction industry. It has different applications in construction elements, notably walls and pavements. Between 85â€“90% of new dwellings in Australia in 2011 were built with external brick walls and concrete flooring. Furthermore, brickwork generates an abundance of waste in construction projects each year. This paper investigates the opportunities for minimising the volume of brick waste across its supply chain based on circular economy principles. It develops a model called Brick- LoWMoR (Low of Waste, More of Resource) which can identify these opportunities across the brick supply chain from manufacturing through to design, construction and various end of life stages. This paper provides practical recommendations to improve brick waste management for construction and demolition activities. The recommendations can also inform the development of building codes and standards which impact on the construction and demolition (C&D) waste stream in Australia."
"Projecting biodiversity benefits of conservation behavior-change programs Community Participation; Green Product; Environmental Attitudes Biodiversity loss is driven by human behavior, but there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of behavior-change programs in delivering benefits to biodiversity. To demonstrate their value, the biodiversity benefits and cost-effectiveness of behavior changes that directly or indirectly affect biodiversity need to be quantified. We adapted a structured decision-making prioritization tool to determine the potential biodiversity benefits of behavior changes. As a case study, we examined two hypothetical behavior-change programsâ€“â€“wildlife gardening and cat containmentâ€“â€“by asking experts to consider the behaviors associated with these programs that directly and indirectly affect biodiversity. We assessed benefits to southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) and superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus) by eliciting from experts estimates of the probability of each species persisting in the landscape given a range of behavior-change scenarios in which uptake of the behaviors varied. We then compared these estimates to a business-as-usual scenario to determine the relative biodiversity benefit and cost-effectiveness of each scenario. Experts projected that the behavior-change programs would benefit biodiversity and that benefits would rise with increasing uptake of the target behaviors. Biodiversity benefits were also predicted to accrue through indirect behaviors, although experts disagreed about the magnitude of additional benefit provided. Scenarios that combined the two behavior-change programs were estimated to provide the greatest benefits to species and be most cost-effective. Our method could be used in other contexts and potentially at different scales and advances the use of prioritization tools to guide conservation behavior-change programs."

"Remaking Post-industrial Plans: Urban Industrial Zoning Past and Future (administered by Monash University) This project aims to examine the changing functions and roles of urban industrial land. Planning for industrial land remains rooted in approaches that are out of step with existing and emerging conditions. Urban policymakers sacrifice dwindling employment lands for property value growth and miss opportunities to incorporate industrial activity in sustainable planning goals. Through digital archival mapping, on-site analysis, and planner interviews, this project seeks to develop a deeper understanding of how industrial lands and their regulatory settings are linked to changes in urban development over time. This should lead to new knowledge to reinvent industrial zones
to meet contemporary needs and adapt to future disruptions."

"In vitro and in silico approach of fungal growth inhibition by Trichoderma asperellum HbGT6-07 derived volatile organic compounds Trichoderma; Fungi; Harzianum A The species of Trichoderma are one of the most frequently used natural biocontrol agent. This study, we identified isolate HbGT6-07 of Trichoderma asperellum and evaluated the antimicrobial effects both in vitro and in silico approaches. Tested 10% concentrated culture filtrate of HbGT6-07 inhibited 98% of colony radial growth in B. cinerea (B05.10) as well as 91% of S. sclerotiorum (A367). HbGT6-07 was detected to produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with antifungal activity. In in-vitro dish-within-dish method (DwD), The HbGT6-07 VOCs effectively reduced colonial diameter, growth rate and sclerotia production by two virulent fungal pathogens. Moreover, the hyphal fragments of HbGT6-07 demonstrated successful mycelia growth suppression (97%) against infection oilseed rape leaves by hyphae of the two virulent fungal pathogens through competition. The mixed culture assay, exhibited that the isolate T. asperellum HbGT6-07 was significantly reduced the production and weight of sclerotia. The GC-MS analysis identified 32 VOCs derived from HbGT6-07. In addition, VOCs derived from HbGT6-07 were assessed against targeted protein of three fungal species; Aspergillus oryzae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans via molecular docking. Butylated hydroxytolune and Beta-Cedrene had energy (âˆ’5.3 and âˆ’5.7 Kcal/mol) for targeted protein of Aspergillus oryzae and (âˆ’6.8 and âˆ’8.0 Kcal/mol) for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas alpha-bergamotene and Beta-Cedrene exihbit energy (âˆ’7.5 and âˆ’7.4 Kcal/mol), respectively. The molecular dynamics study confirms the structural stability and rigidity of the docked complex through multiple descriptors from simulation trajectories. The above findings indicated that HbGT6-07 could attain competitive progress via production of VOCs and comprehensive mycelial growth."
"Computational modelling of multiphase fluid flow behaviour over a stretching sheet in the presence of nanoparticles Nanofluid; Stagnation Point Flow; MHD Flow Present study analysed hydrodynamic flow behaviour of multiphase radiative Casson and Maxwell fluids with the appearance of nano-sized particles. The impression of a nonlinear chemical reaction is also considered. Firstly, the time-dependent governing equations were computationally resolved using finite difference discretisation methods. Secondly, the convergence analysis with stabilisation of the numerical approach is carried out where the current model has converged for Le â‰¥ 0.025 and Pr â‰¥ 0.075. Finally, the impressions of various pertinent parameters are depicted diagrammatically along with tabular analysis on diversified flow fields. The main aim is to define and draw a comparison between Maxwell and Casson fluids on different flow fields. In addition, a comparative study between these two fluids is also newly carried out in this work through the analysis of streamlines and isotherms plotting. Furthermore, the thermal and mass properties found significantly improved mostly in the case of Maxwell fluid. However, Eckert number, Ec, has influenced the temperature field significantly for Casson fluid, and some parameters (Du, Nt, Nb, Le, Pr and Sr) have represented the identical impact on respective fields for both fluids. For the numerical validation, some comparisons are also shown with previous studies and satisfactory agreement is observed."
"Lamb to Rayleigh Wave Conversion on Superstrates as a Means to Facilitate Disposable Acoustomicrofluidic Applications Surface Acoustic Wave; Droplet; Interdigital Transducers Rayleigh surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have been demonstrated as a powerful and effective means for driving a wide range of microfluidic actuation processes. Traditionally, SAWs have been generated on piezoelectric substrates, although the cost of the material and the electrode deposition process makes them less amenable as low-cost and disposable components. As such, a ""razor-and-blades"" model that couples the acoustic energy of the SAW on the piezoelectric substrate through a fluid coupling layer and into a low-cost and, hence, disposable silicon superstrate on which various microfluidic processes can be conducted has been proposed. Nevertheless, it was shown that only bulk vibration in the form of Lamb waves can be excited in the superstrate, which is considerably less efficient and flexible in terms of microfluidic functionality compared to its surface counterpart, that is, the SAW. Here, we reveal an extremely simple way that quite unexpectedly and rather nonintuitively allows SAWs to be generated on the superstrate - by coating the superstrate with a thin gold layer. In addition to verifying the existence of the SAW on the coated superstrate, we carry out finite-difference time domain numerical simulations that not only confirm the experimental observations but also facilitate an understanding of the surprising difference that the coating makes. Finally, we elucidate the various power-dependent particle concentration phenomena that can be carried out in a sessile droplet atop the superstrate and show the possibility for simply carrying out rapid and effective microcentrifugation - a process that is considerably more difficult with Lamb wave excitation on the superstrate."

"Diagnostic analysis of a single-cell Proton Exchange Membrane unitised regenerative fuel cell using numerical simulation Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC); Diffusion in Gases; Electrode Fabrication and testing of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells to improve performance is an expensive and time-consuming process. This paper presents a novel procedure for using computer simulation â€“ namely the ANSYS PEM Fuel Cell Module â€“ to identify key performance limiting factors in fuel cell mode of a PEM Unitised Regenerative Fuel cell (URFC) fabricated at RMIT by comparing its performance with a higher performing URFC reported in the literature. The diagnostic analysis is performed in two steps: firstly, changing operating conditions to ensure both cells are compared based on the same conditions; secondly identifying differences in cell properties, specifically catalyst exchange current densities and membrane conductivity. The simulation results show that applying the more optimal operating conditions of the higher performing cell doubled the maximum power of the RMIT cell (from 0.163 W/cm2 to 0.327 W/cm2). To overcome the remaining performance deficit in the ohmic polarization region, the value of the protonic conduction coefficient in the modelled RMIT cell had to be increased. Overall the study indicates that computer simulation modelling, in conjunction with carefully focussed experiments, can be a very useful tool in diagnosing fuel-cell performance problems."

"A review of cultural background and thermal perceptions in urban environments Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Microclimate Thermal comfort is among the chief indicators of the sustainability of outdoor spaces. However, the complex nature of comfort represents the interaction of several determinants that leads to a perception of the thermal environment. Recently, researchers have paid particular attention to non-physical factors to understand the mechanisms involved in thermal perceptions in urban environments. The extant literature has contended that culture and cultural background are determinants to individualsâ€™ thermal perceptions. Therefore, this study aimed to review how the link between outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) and cultural background is investigated. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first review study on the subject. The study used a systematic literature review approach based on secondary data available in relevant and contemporary literature. The findings first showed the scarcity of research on cultural background and OTC; however, all studies identified corroborated the significant impact of cultural background on thermal perceptions. Notably, the cultural background was found to be the source of variation in thermal perceptions, tolerance to, and preference for certain thermal conditions, thermal comfort requirements and expectations, choice of clothing, and environmental attitudes. The findings provide a sound basis for future researchers to address the research gaps identified. The study also raises policy makersâ€™ and designersâ€™ awareness of urban environment usersâ€™ genuine needs and requirements."

"Trade liberalization, financial modernization and economic development: An empirical study of selected Asia–Pacific countries Financial Development; Economic Growth; Trade Openness This study investigates the relationship between trade liberalization, financial modernization and economic development for 14 countries in the Asia and Pacific region over the period spanning from 1961 to 2011. The study uses panel data as they have many advantages over cross-sectional or time series data. In addition to analyzing the full panel, we also divide the 14 countries under study into two sub-samples: high-income countries and middle-income countries, based on World Bank's income classification as of 1st July 2013. The panel cointegration tests show a long run relationship between the above variables. The study uses Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) method to estimate the models and then conducts Granger causality tests to identify patterns of causation among the variables of interest. In general, the results indicate unidirectional causality (1) from financial modernization to economic development for the entire panel and the panel of middle-income countries; (2) from trade liberalization to economic development for the whole panel as well as two subpanels of high-income and middle-income countries; and (3) from trade liberalization to financial modernization for the whole panel as well as two subpanels. The findings of this study support that the actual effect of financial depth on economic development (and vice versa) seems to depend on the level of financial development."

"Review of resilience assessment of coastal bridges to extreme wave-induced loads Wave Force; Coast; Tsunamis Coastal bridges are susceptible to severe damage due to wave-induced forces during extreme events such as coastal flooding, hurricanes, storm surges and tsunamis. As a direct impact of climate change, the frequency and intensity of these events are also expected to increase in the future. This paper presents a comprehensive review of a four-phase resilience assessment of coastal bridge structures, namely, (i) characterization of external wave-induced forces, (ii) structural response of bridges, (iii) vulnerability assessment of damaged components, and (iv) post-disaster recovery. The four comprehensive modules are adopted from the classic framework of PEER PBEE and constitute the integrated knowledge needed for the prediction of the resilience of infrastructure under extreme wave-induced loads. The study also presents new expressions for resilience restoration that simultaneously account for the time, resources (cost) and environmental impacts of different recovery options with variable importance levels to different stakeholders."

"The fragility of results and bias in empirical research: an exploratory exposition Firm; Bribes; Anti-corruption Measures The results of empirical work in economics and finance are typically sensitive, inter alia, to model specification, sample period, variable definitions and estimation methods. If the underlying issue attracts bias of some sort, the reporting of the results tends to be selective, intended to confirm prior beliefs, which may be ideologically-driven, or to make the paper more publishable. In this paper the fragility (variability and sensitivity) of empirical results is demonstrated and the process whereby it enables research selection bias is described. For this purpose, several research areas are considered, including the determinants of economic growth, the effect of gender on risk aversion, the determinants of capital structure, the J-curve effect, the effect of corruption on foreign direct investment, and the Kuznets curve."

"Flexible conservation decisions for climate adaptation Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework Climate change is transforming the decision-making landscape for many conservation organizations. Conservation planning and implementation under climate change are challenging due to uncertainties about climate impacts and the effectiveness of adaptation options. Strategically building flexibility into conservation plans so they can be adjusted over time in response to unforeseen events, or new information, is one solution to this challenge. Yet, there are a wide range of mechanisms to choose from to enhance flexibility and so there is a need for a more structured approach to inform building flexibility into conservation plans. To achieve this, we conceptualize flexible strategies as three types, procedural flexibility, resource flexibility, and action flexibility, and explicitly link these to climate risks and steps in conservation decision-making processes. We discuss how this framework can guide choices of flexible strategies, including identifying the costs and benefits, and illustrate this using examples. This provides a new conceptual tool for conservation organizations to make strategic choices about flexibility for climate adaptation."

"Assessing the impact of using instant messaging in elearning on the performance of teaching and learning in higher education Digital Natives; Education; Information Literacy There are growing interests in improving teaching and learning performance through eLearning using specific emerging technologies in higher education. As a result, understanding the impact of using such technologies on the performance of teaching and learning is becoming important. This experimental study investigates the impact of eLearning using instant messaging on the performance of teaching and learning in higher education in developing countries. Pre-test and post-test surveys are used for collecting experimental data from participants to investigate the impact of using instant messaging on teaching and learning. Data analysis conducted quantitatively using SPSS reveals that eLearning using instant messaging improves teaching and learning. In particular, the use of instant messaging in eLearning is more effective than face-to-face teaching and learning with respect to the overall performance in the classroom. This leads to the conclusion that eLearning using instant messaging could transform teaching and learning in higher education in developing countries."
"World city futures: The role of urban and regional policies in the Asia Pacific region Hukou; China; Land Development This chapter addresses six major policy issues that confront planners concerned with placing their cities in the top rank of the world hierarchy: spatial organization, regional governance, social and environmental sustainability, migrant workers, the rise of civil society, and intercity networks. It reviews the geography of global capitalism, because the â€˜regional levelâ€™ to which A. J. Scott refers is precisely the level of world city formation. The chief sources of demographic growth for the mega-city regions come from rural migration and international migration, though Asian world cities are beginning to experience international migration as well. Rural households in world city regions are tightly integrated with an urban economy that is grounded in manufacturing and business services. The hyper-urbanizing cities of Asia are thus drawing on the so-called surplus population of rural and small town areas within their own country, although migrant workers are beginning to arrive in larger numbers also from abroad."

With less private and communal space, residents are hypothesised to rely on public spaces for physical, social and recreational activities. Yet, little is known about which spaces apartment residents use and why. This project aims to generate new knowledge on: (1) public open space use by apartment dwellers, including which spaces are used and why; and (2) test whether public open space use compensates for reduced apartment/building space. Findings will be used to create tailored, equitable evidence-based recommendations for public open space planning and apartment design guidelines."

"Review of drivers and threats to coastal groundwater quality in China Nutrients; Submarines; Radon With rapid socio-economic development, China's coastal areas are among the fastest growing and most economically dynamic regions in the world. Under the influence of climate change and human activities, protecting the quality of coastal groundwater has emerged as one of the key environmental and resource management issues for these areas. This paper reviews (for the first time) groundwater quality data for the coastal basins of China, where over 600 million people live, focussing on key inorganic indicators/pollutants; groundwater salinity, nitrate, fluoride, and arsenic. These pollutants present major water quality issues and are also valuable as indicators of wider processes and influences impacting coastal groundwater quality â€“ e.g. saltwater intrusion, agricultural pollution and release of geo-genic contaminants. We discuss the major drivers causing water quality problems in different regions and assess future trajectories and challenges for controlling changes in coastal groundwater quality in China. Multiple processes, including modern and palaeo seawater/brine migration, groundwater pumping for agricultural irrigation, pollution from agrochemical application, rapid development of aquaculture, urban growth, and water transfer projects, may all be responsible (to different degrees) for changes observed in coastal groundwater quality, and associated long-term health and ecological effects. We discuss implications for sustainable coastal aquifer management in China, arguing that groundwater monitoring and contamination control measures require urgent improvement. The evolution and treatment of coastal groundwater quality problems in China will serve as an important warning and example for other countries facing similar pressures, due to climate change, coastal development, and intensification of anthropogenic activity in coming decades."

"“Dropping out and working”: The vocational narratives of creative graduates Cultural Economy; Freelancer; Art This chapter focuses on the vocational narratives of creative graduates. Using qualitative interviews from Australia and the UK, it reflects on how vocational identities are produced by creatives and how they understand the relationship between creative skills and employment more broadly. Using the concept of â€œnarratives of employabilityâ€ and reflecting on the inability of creative graduates to use their educational credentials, we highlight how the â€œlived and narrated experienceâ€ that is not only reported but continuously performed and embodied, becomes a key object of analysis. The findings highlight that such narratives balance a set of common oppositions, such as commitment/flexibility, autonomy/instrumentalism, and personal effort/constraints of social context. We observe that vocational narratives are used in relation to managing (financial) risk and â€œembeddedâ€ forms of creative work, allowing graduates to fine-tune their vocational identity within creative work in and outside of the creative industries."

"Latitude, Elevation, and Mean Annual Temperature Predict Peat Organic Matter Chemistry at a Global Scale Carbon Dioxide; Methane Emission; Fens Peatlands contain a significant fraction of global soil carbon, but how these reservoirs will respond to the changing climate is still relatively unknown. A global picture of the variations in peat organic matter chemistry will aid our ability to gauge peatland soil response to climate. The goal of this research is to test the hypotheses that (a) peat carbohydrate content, an indicator of soil organic matter reactivity, will increase with latitude and decrease with mean annual temperatures, (b) while peat aromatic content, an indicator of recalcitrance, will vary inversely, and (c) elevation will have a similar effect to latitude. We used Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy to examine variations in the organic matter functional groups of 1034 peat samples collected from 10 to 20, 30â€“40, and 60â€“70 cm depths at 165 individual sites across a latitudinal gradient of 79Â°Nâ€“65Â°S and from elevations of 0â€“4,773 m. Carbohydrate contents of high latitude peat were significantly greater than peat originating near the equator, while aromatic content showed the opposite trend. For peat from similar latitudes but different elevations, the carbohydrate content was greater and aromatic content was lower at higher elevations. Higher carbohydrate content at higher latitudes indicates a greater potential for mineralization, whereas the chemical composition of low latitude peat is consistent with their apparent relative stability in the face of warmer temperatures. The combination of low carbohydrates and high aromatics at warmer locations near the equator suggests the mineralization of high latitude peat until reaching recalcitrance under a new temperature regime."

"Development of effective and sustainable adsorbent biomaterial from an agricultural waste material: Cu(II) removal Mechanical Properties; Sisal; Coir Motivated by the significant scope which exists to generate value-added products from agricultural waste materials, in this work a comprehensive study was performed on the microstructure of alkali-treated coconut coir in order to evaluate its potential as an environmentally friendly absorbent. By investigating the influence of the alkali concentration, temperature and treatment time through a systematic Design of Experiments (DOE) approach, it was found that alkali-treated coconut coir possessed greatly improved water and moisture absorption properties (27% and 30% increases, respectively, compared to those of untreated coconut coir). The efficiency of heavy metal removal of treated coconut coir samples has been studied by investigating Cu (II) removal performance of selected samples with higher water and moisture absorbency. The effect of contact time and concentration of Cu (II) on the Cu (II) removal efficiency of samples have been investigated. The results show almost five times higher Cu (II) removal performance for the treated sample compared to raw coconut coir under optimized conditions. These findings highlight that the alkali treatment of biomaterials such as coconut coir can be used to tailor their water-absorbency properties as well as their adsorption properties, providing facile and effective adsorbent materials from readily available agricultural waste materials."

"How the missing matter The project aims to investigate how the unresolved issue of the missing from conflicts impacts on the identities, memories and migration patterns of the survivors in the aftermath of violence and displacement. The comparative ethnographic study expects to contribute to the innovative theorising of memory, community and the missing. Outcomes of this project will include raising awareness about the missing worldwide and informing policy on migration and resettlement of refugees in Australia and internationally. This should provide significant benefits in terms of broadening understanding of refugee wellbeing following resettlement and improving the work done by governments and organisations in creating supportive resettlement contexts."
"Latest advancements on livestock waste management and biogas production: Bangladesh's perspective Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production Large quantity of animal waste production in Bangladesh has spurred the demand of potential applications for waste management. Therefore, biofuel production from animal waste has been projected as the solution for animal waste management along with the potential of a new source of renewable energy. This study aimed to evaluate the production of biogas from the farm wastes in Bangladesh and presented the potential biological applications for processing the wastes to convert into biogas. The study demonstrated that the highest amount of livestock waste, approximately 229 million ton was produced in 2016 and it was accounted for a total biogas production potential of 16988.97 million m3 which could be converted into 16.68 Ã— 107 MWh of electricity. This study also presented the suitable conversion technologies as well as mechanisms of biogas production from animal waste and related mathematical equations to calculate the amount of total biogas productions. The latest advancements in large scale biogas production via government and non-government organizations have also been documented in this work. Besides biogas production analysis, this study also demonstrated the environmental impacts of biogas application. A net CO2 emission reduction of 4.42 million tons could have been achieved over the diesel power generation along with 29 million ton of biofertilizer. The study also proposed a management plan to improve the current waste removal situation in Bangladesh. Along with that, this review comprehensively outlined the worldwide scenario of biogas production and applications."

"Opportunities for biodiversity conservation as cities adapt to climate change Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Cities are investing billions of dollars in climate change adaptation to combat the effects of sea-level rise, temperature extremes, increasingly intense storm events, flooding and water scarcity. Natural ecosystems have enormous potential to contribute to city resilience, and so, actions that rely on this approach could sustain considerable co-benefits for biodiversity. In this paper we identify the prevalence of key themes of human adaptation response that could have biodiversity conservation outcomes in cities. We then quantify the area of impact for actions that identify specific targets for greening or green infrastructure that could involve natural ecosystems, providing an indicator of potential co-benefits to biodiversity. We then extrapolate to explore the total area of land that could benefit from catchment management approaches, the area of waterways that could benefit from nature-based improvement of these spaces, and finally the number of threatened species that could benefit across these cities. From 80 city climate adaptation plans analysed, we found that urban greening plays a key role in most adaptation strategies, and represents an enormous opportunity for biodiversity conservation, given the diversity of animal and plant species in urban environments. We show that the ranges of at least 270 threatened species overlap with the area covered by just 58 city adaptation plans, including watershed catchments totalling over 28 million km2. However, an analysis of 80 city adaptation plans (of a total 151 found globally) shows that this opportunity is being missed. Just 18% of the plans assessed contained specific intentions to promote biodiversity. We highlight this missed opportunity, as climate adaptation actions undertaken by cities represent an enormous incipient opportunity for nature conservation. Finally, we encourage planners and city governments to incorporate biological conservation into climate adaption plans, for the mutual benefit of urban societies and their biodiversity."
"Urban greening, property and more-than-human commoning Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems Urban greening is about bringing vegetation into cities in ways that produce flourishing urban ecologies whilst also making cities more liveable for human inhabitants. We focus here on greening that is done through the maintenance or establishment of gardens, parks, urban forests and informal spaces. We argue that in contexts with established property law systems, such as Australia, making urban ecologies through greening is shaped heavily by relations of property tied to land. This includes constraining the extent to which urban greening can contribute to socio-ecologically just cities. We suggest that progressing greening that is more attentive to the geographies and temporalities of more-than-human life requires us to trouble the hold of property over greening. To do this we explore the possibilities opened up by the lens of urban commons/commoning. We engage with the emerging concept of more-than-human commoning as a way of attuning urban greening to nonhuman agency and affordances. We also grapple with the risk of obscuring or concealing difference between humans in the way commoning makes room for more-than-humans, especially in the context of settler-colonialism. We conclude by calling for a more overt politics of urban greening that encompasses diverse human and more-than-human experiences of the city."

"Phillip Island Nature Parks Research Project Evaluating interactions of beachgoers and their dogs with local wildlife Phillip Island Nature Parks (PINP) are currently pursuing a number of interventions and awareness campaigns aimed at reducing conflicts and harmful interactions between off-leash dogs and local wildlife on PINP-managed beaches. Reducing harm and disturbance to Hooded Plovers (Thinornis rubricollis) during breeding season has been a focus of these efforts, which has included volunteer observation and discussion with beachgoers who are not following regulations to keep dogs on leads where required. The People, Nature, Place Research Program (PNP) are seeking to assist with research that helps to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of these interventions over time. This research could form the first phase of a wider-reaching, longer term examination of the extent to which the community (local and visitor) understands the protection measures for local wildlife on beaches, and how greater care, respect and responsibility for local wildlife could be fostered amongst beachgoers, residents and visitors to Phillip Island."
"Performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine powered by macadamia and grapeseed biodiesels Fuel Tests; Diesel Engines; Biofuel Biodiesel is an alternative, eco-friendly and renewable source of energy. It can be produced from a wide range of feedstocks which can be grown in marginal land use. It has drawn more attention to the researchers. In this study, the oil extraction, biodiesel conversion, and physiochemical properties of Macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia) and Grapeseed (Vitis vinifera) biodiesels are presented. The experimental investigation of diesel engine performance, emissions and combustion characteristics were conducted using B5 (5% biodiesel and 95% diesel by volume) and B10 (10% biodiesel and 90% diesel by volume) blends. The engine performance parameters, such as brake power (BP), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) have been investigated in this experiment. The emission parameters, for example, carbon monoxide (CO), the ratio of CO2/CO, nitrogen oxide (NOx), hydrocarbon (HC), particulate matter (PM) have been measured during the experiment. Finally, the combustion parameters such as cylinder pressure (CP) were recorded, and heat release rate (HRR) was analysed and compared with that of diesel fuel. The study revealed that the Macadamia biodiesel performed better than Grapeseed biodiesel and behaved closely to that of diesel fuel. A significant reduction of engine emissions was found in the case of Macadamia biodiesel with a minimal reduction of engine performance. Further analysis of energy, exergy and tribological characteristics of the Macadamia biodiesel is recommended for assessing its feasibility for commercial application."
"Advanced RF and microwave functions based on an integrated optical frequency comb source Microresonators; Solitons; Comb and Wattles We demonstrate advanced transversal radio frequency (RF) and microwave functions based on a Kerr optical comb source generated by an integrated micro-ring resonator. We achieve extremely high performance for an optical true time delay aimed at tunable phased array antenna applications, as well as reconfigurable microwave photonic filters. Our results agree well with theory. We show that our true time delay would yield a phased array antenna with features that include high angular resolution and a wide range of beam steering angles, while the microwave photonic filters feature high Q factors, wideband tunability, and highly reconfigurable filtering shapes. These results show that our approach is a competitive solution to implementing reconfigurable, high performance and potentially low cost RF and microwave signal processing functions for applications including radar and communication systems."

"Marriage trafficking: Women in forced wedlock Human Trafficking; Sexual Exploitation; Prostitution This book examines the traffic in women for marriage, a phenomenon that has been largely overlooked in international efforts to address the problem of human trafficking. In contrast to current international and state-based approaches to trafficking, which tend to focus on sex trafficking and trafficking for forced labour, this book seeks to establish how marriage as an institution is often implicated in the occurrence of trafficking in women. The book aims firstly to establish why marriage has tended not to be included in dominant conceptions of trafficking in persons and secondly to determine whether certain types of marriage may constitute cases of human trafficking, in and of themselves. Through the use of case studies on forced marriage, mail-order bride (MOB) marriage and Fundamentalist Mormon polygamy, this book demonstrates that certain kinds of marriage may in fact constitute situations of trafficking in persons and together form the under-recognised phenomenon of â€˜marriage traffickingâ€™. In addition, the book offers a new perspective on the types of harm involved in trafficking in women by developing a framework for identifying the particular abuses characteristic to marriage trafficking. It argues that the traffic in women for marriage cannot be understood merely as a subset of sex trafficking or trafficking for forced labour, but rather constitutes a distinctive form of trafficking in its own right. This book will be of great interest to scholars and postgraduates working in the fields of human rights theory and institutions, political science, international law, transnational crime, trafficking in persons and feminist political theory."
"Factors affecting the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices: Findings from panel data for Vietnam Agriculture; Indo-Gangetic Plain; Tillage Conventional farming and climate change are placing considerable stress on agricultural systems around the world, leading to increased hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, particularly in developing countries. Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) can help raise productivity and agricultural incomes while minimising negative environmental impacts. While recognising that sustainability is a contested term, we identify agricultural practices that are generally viewed as sustainable as they minimise impacts on the environment. Despite the benefits of SAPs, adoption rates are still low in developing countries. While previous studies have examined the factors affecting SAP adoption, most have not accounted for issues of heterogeneity and endogeneity inherent in such analysis. In this paper, we address this by employing a random-effects probit model with the Mundlak approach and fixed-effects linear probability models to control for farmer- and plot-level heterogeneities and to avoid the incidental parameters problem. We analyse panel data from Vietnam for approximately 14,000 plots over the period 2008â€“2016 to identify the factors behind SAP adoption. Overall, we find that improved knowledge transferred by extension agents and learning from peers significantly influence adoption. Farmers' knowledge of their land and soil quality are also important factors. We recommend enhancing cooperation between extension agents, farmer groups and peers in order to encourage SAP adoption."

"Go hydrogen! Promoting Japanese awareness of Australian hydrogen The purpose of the activity is to deliver the project AJF2021104 -Go hydrogen! Promoting Japanese awareness of Australian hydrogen. This project aims to promote Japanese awareness of Australian hydrogen production. Australia and Japan have developed a bilateral trade partnership through hydrogen production. From 2021, Australian hydrogen will be exported to Kobe using a special cargo ship designed in Japan. This world-first hydrogen export project has been developed jointly by thepublic and private sectors of both countries. However, as highlighted at the Australia Japan Business Co-operation Committee’s webinar in April 2021, information on Australian hydrogen has not been adequately communicated to Japanese citizens. Unlike standard Australian export products, it is hard for Japanese people to understand where and how Australian hydrogen is produced. In collaboration with Tohoku University, this project will develop visual communication content to raise Japanese citizens’ awareness of Australian hydrogen production. Communication content will include material such as short videos, fact sheets, posters, technical diagrams, and other learning material. This project will contribute to increase awareness of Australian hydrogen and support Japan’s transition to renewable energy. It also promotes the Japan-Australia Partnership on Decarbonisation through Technology signed by Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga at the G7 on 13 June 2021."
"Neurosteroid-based intervention using Ganaxolone and Emapunil for improving stress-induced myelination deficits and neurobehavioural disorders Ice Storm; Prenatal Stress; Prenatal Exposure Background: Prenatal stress is associated with long-term disturbances in white matter development and behaviour in children, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. Oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin formation is a tightly orchestrated process beginning during gestation, and therefore is very vulnerable to the effects of maternal prenatal stresses in mid-late pregnancy. The current study aimed to examine the effects of prenatal stress on components of the oligodendrocyte lineage to identify the key processes that are disrupted and to determine if postnatal therapies directed at ameliorating white matter deficits also improve behavioural outcomes. Methods: Pregnant guinea pig dams were exposed to control-handling or prenatal stress with strobe light exposure for 2hrs/day on gestational age (GA) 50, 55, 60 and 65, and allowed to spontaneously deliver ~GA70. Pups were administered oral ganaxolone (5 mg/kg/day in 45% cyclodextrin) or the TSPO agonist, emapunil (XBD173; 0.3 mg/kg/day in 1% tragacanth gum) or vehicle, on postnatal days (PND) 1â€“7. Behavioural outcomes were assessed using open field and elevated plus maze testing on PND7 and PND27. Hippocampal samples were collected at PND30 to assess markers of oligodendrocyte development through assessment of total oligodendrocytes (OLIG2) and mature cells (myelin basic protein; MBP), and total neurons (NeuN) by immunostaining. Real-time PCR was conducted on hippocampal regions to assess markers of the oligodendrocyte lineage, markers of neurogenesis and components of the neurosteroidogenesis pathway. Plasma samples were collected for steroid quantification of cortisol, allopregnanolone, progesterone and testosterone by ELISA. Results: Prenatal stress resulted in hyperactivity in male offspring, and anxiety-like behaviour in female offspring in the guinea pig at an age equivalent to late childhood. Postnatal ganaxolone and emapunil treatment after prenatal stress restored the behavioural phenotype to that of control in females only. The oligodendrocyte maturation lineage, translation of MBP mRNA-to-protein, and neurogenesis were disrupted in prenatally-stressed offspring, resulting in a decreased amount of mature myelin. Emapunil treatment restored mature myelin levels in both sexes, and reversed disruptions to the oligodendrocyte lineage in female offspring, an effect not seen with ganaxolone treatment. Conclusion: The marked and persisting behavioural and white matter perturbations observed in a clinically relevant guinea pig model of prenatal stress highlights the need for postnatal interventions that increase myelin repair and improve long-term outcomes. The effectiveness of emapunil treatment in restoring female offspring behaviour, and promoting maturation of myelin indicates that early therapeutic interventions can reverse the damaging effects of major stressful events in pregnancy. Further studies optimising target mechanisms and dosing are warranted."

"Connecting survivors to therapeutic support and criminal justice through informal reporting options: an analysis of sexual violence reports made to a digital reporting tool in Australia Sexual Assault; Rape; Victims This article analyses the content of 483 reports of sexual violence, including rape, sexual assault, child sexual abuse and various forms of sexual harassment, made to a digital reporting tool (DRT) developed by a rape crisis centre in Melbourne, Australia. These written digital reports were made in a confidential and informal capacity, with all de-identified reports distributed to relevant policing jurisdictions to support intelligence gathering. Based on an analysis of the de-identified reports, this article suggests the DRT functioned as an important gateway in connecting survivors with appropriate therapeutic support when disclosing sexual violence and had a demonstrable capacity to provide the police with information for intelligence gathering. There was also scope for survivors to make formal reports should they wish to do so. However, further research with police, sexual violence support services and survivors is needed to develop a full understanding of the potential of informal sexual violence reporting options."
"Infrequent detection of unintentional fentanyl use via urinalysis among people who regularly inject opioids in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia U-47700; N-(1-Phenethylpiperidin-4-Yl)-N-Phenylacetamide; Intoxication Background and aim: The current phase of the North American â€˜opioid crisisâ€™ is characterised by illicit fentanyl use; however, the presence of illicit fentanyl in Australia is unknown. This study aimed to monitor unintentional fentanyl consumption in Australia. Design: Rapid urine drug screens (UDS) paired with surveys conducted within supervised injecting facilities (SIFs) and confirmatory laboratory testing. Setting: Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. Participants: Clients who used heroin within the past 2 days (n = 911 tests, 2017â€“2021). Participants were demographically similar to the overall client base (median age 43, 72% male). Measurements: UDS were conducted using BTNX Rapid Response fentanyl urine strip tests with cross-reactivity to numerous fentanyl analogues. Positive urine samples were analysed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Surveys covered past 3 day drug use and lifetime report of fentanyl in heroin. Findings: Two percent of participants reported intentional use of fentanyl, mostly through fentanyl patches. Of the 911 rapid UDS conducted, 17 (1.9%) yielded positive results. Eight of these (all from Melbourne) were not explained by survey-reported fentanyl use in the past 3 days. Of these 8 unexplained positives, confirmatory laboratory analysis was conducted on 6, with 4 deemed to be false positives, and 2 confirmed for the presence of fentanyl. This represents the first confirmation of unintended use of fentanyl type substances in this population. Conclusion: There is limited evidence of unintentional fentanyl use among people in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia who regularly inject heroin, suggesting that, currently, there is very little illicit fentanyl in Australian drug markets accessed by supervised injecting facilities attendees. This study demonstrates the feasibility of quick onsite testing to cost-effectively screen large samples for fentanyl; however, the high false positive rate emphasises the need for confirmation of positive tests through advanced analytical techniques."

"Assessing multi-climate-hazard threat in the coastal region of Bangladesh by combining influential environmental and anthropogenic factors Bangladesh; Cyclonic Storms; Disaster This study developed a geo-spatial framework for assessing multi-hazard threat on the Bangladesh coast, integrating environmental hazards (EH), geo-environmental attributes (GA), and anthropogenic modifications (AM) based on their potential contribution to overall threat. For this purpose, a fuzzy logic based analytical technique was integrated with geospatial mapping. Thematic layers were prepared for twenty-three theoretically important factors representing the three components of threat. The spatial variations of threat and its components were delineated through spatial overlaying of the respective layers in a GIS environment. The final threat map revealed 32% (5338 km2) and 4% (646 km2) of the area of the western deltaic coast, which encompassed >50â€“60% of the areas of Khulna, Bagerhat, and Satkhira districts, was under high and very high threat, respectively, owing primarily to frequent cyclones, salinity ingression, and subsidence, and secondarily to the low elevation of the coast, high astronomical tide, shallow bathymetry, excessive groundwater extraction, and polder construction. High and very high threat zones within the central estuarine coast corresponded to 27% (4518 km2) and 16% (2618 km2) of the area, including most of Bhola, Barguna, and Patuakhali districts, which was attributable to the effects of coastal erosion, sea-level rise, flooding and the ancillary effects of strong wave action, high river discharge, deforestation, and land transformation. Around 14% (948 km2) and 3% (164 km2) of the eastern cliff coast, comprising the southwestern part of the Coxsbazar district, was found to be under high and very high threat, respectively, due to the direct effects of sea-level rise, storm surge, erosion, and indirect effects of closeness to the shoreline, alluvial composition of the beach, tourism, and pollution from industries. The outcomes of this study could guide the coastal managers of Bangladesh in prioritizing actions aimed at disaster risk reduction and sustainable development of this region."

"Corrosion and Wear Resistance of Micro-Arc Oxidation Composite Coatings on Magnesium Alloy AZ31—The Influence of Inclusions of Carbon Spheres Magnesium Alloys; Ceramic Coatings; Aluminum Poor corrosion and wear resistance of magnesium (Mg) alloys restrict their applications. Herein, corrosion and wear-resistant films are formed upon Mg alloy AZ31 through a micro-arc oxidation (MAO) process in silicate electrolyte in the presence of carbon spheres (CS). Surface morphology, chemical composition, corrosion resistance, hardness, and coefficient of friction (CoF) of the MAO coatings are investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemical and hydrogen evolution measurements, automatic micro-hardness testing, and reciprocating tribometer, respectively. Results demonstrate that the surface morphology and hardness of MAO coatings vary with the concentration of CS. The presence of CS results in an increased coating thickness from 8.0 Â± 1.8 to 12.2 Â± 1.8 Î¼m, mean pore size from 0.7 Â± 0.1 to 1.9 Â± 0.1 Î¼m, open porosity of MAO coating from 4.2 Â± 0.4 to 5.6% Â± 1.1%, and coating hardness from 347.0 Â± 59.0 to 853.0 Â± 67.3 Vickers-hardness (HV). Furthermore, CS-modified MAO coatings lead to improved corrosion resistance in comparison with that of the neat MAO counterparts. Moreover, the high hardness and formation of SiC of CS-modified coatings lead to a low and stabilized CoF, which implies an enhanced wear resistance."

"Resident’s issues and interactions with grid-connected photovoltaic energy system in high-performing low-energy dwellings: A user’s perspective Insulation; Energy; Energy Saving in Building Solar PV systems have become common-place in many cities and regions, and is a core technology in purpose-built low-energy homes, but evidence is emerging that in many cases electricity output may be significantly lower than expected. Information from in-home energy monitoring systems, interviews and informal discussions with residents has shed some light on the experiences and issues faced by the end-user, particularly those associated with operating a solar PV system to achieve a low-carbon lifestyle. Case studies of residents in different ownership and income situations, and from three distinct housing developments in Australia and England are used to highlight end-user experiences. The study finds that the residents face a range of issues including the initial sizing and commissioning, a lack of solar knowledge and expected generation performance, as well as regulatory barriers that limit the opportunity to upgrade system size."

"Equity of physical characteristics between adolescent males and females participating in single- or mixed-sex sport Age Effects; Players; Soccer Policies on single- or mixed-sex junior sports participation continue to be challenged publically and legally. Often challenges relate to perceptions of size and performance variability between adolescent males and females, yet the evidence base behind these challenges lacks recent review and rigor. Physical performance was compared between males and females from 2 groups of younger (,13 years, n = 109, 67% females, 33% males) and older (â‰¥13 years, n = 108, 43% females, 57% males) adolescents. Using a cross-sectional design, adolescents were tested for speed, strength, power, and endurance. No sex differences were found for most of the physical test results in the ,13 years age group, although males showed greater endurance (p = 0.020) and upper-body strength (p = 0.010) than females. However, among adolescents aged â‰¥13 years, males scored better than females in all physical tests, without exception (p > 0.05). Further explorations comparing how many females in the same age grouping shared test results equal to or greater than the top third of males were fewer in the older than younger age group. Equality of participation in mixed-sex sport becomes more difficult to guarantee for older adolescents when results from generic sport-related physical test performances are considered."

"Transience as method: A conceptual lens to understanding evolving trends in migration, mobility, and diversity in the transnational space Education; Acculturative Stress; Studies Abroad Migration as an act and as a concept is becoming more complex and nuanced not only because of increasing numbers of people and groups criss-crossing and circulating international borders but also because of push-pull factors that determine agendas and aspirations affecting transnational mobile actors. Static and binary understandings of migration as either settled or temporary are thus disrupted with new and impactful rising trends in the migration-mobility nexus identified. Based on observations of global political and community responses to transnational migration, and various research projects I have been involved with on temporary migration (international students, working holiday makers, and university-educated professional workers) in the Asia-Pacific, this article puts forward the idea that transience - a phenomenon where migrants regardless of visa and residency status are, for different reasons, spatially unsettled and transnationally mobile - be used as a conceptual lens in order to see emerging dynamics within the migration-mobility experience. Transience as a conceptual lens provides a disjuncture in our understanding of the migration-mobility nexus beyond the categories of temporary and permanent, and is a useful method in helping us understand the complexities, nuances, and ecologies which emerge from the migration experience, and making us aware of evolving patterns of diversity. Transience, in other words, becomes a new method in understanding evolving and emerging migration patterns by investigating the unevenness of the migrant(ion) journey."

"Optimization of load dispatch strategies for an islanded microgrid connected with renewable energy sources Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems This paper evaluates the design and optimization of an islanded hybrid microgrid for various load dispatch strategies by assessing the optimal sizing of each component, the power system responses and different cost analysis of the microgrid. Four divisions of the northern side of Bangladesh namely, Mymensingh, Rangpur, Rajshahi and Sylhet hybrid microgrids incorporating solar PV, wind turbine, battery storage, diesel generator and a load of 27.31 kW have been optimized for five different dispatch strategies: (i) Load Following, (ii) Cycle Charging, (iii) Generator Order, (iv) Combined Dispatch and (v) HOMER predictive dispatch strategy. The proposed microgrids have been optimized to reduce the Net Present Cost, CO2 emission and Levelized Cost of Energy. All the five dispatch strategies for the four microgrids have been analyzed in HOMER Pro, and subsequently, the power system responses and feasibility analysis of the microgrids have been performed in MATLAB Simulink. The results obtained in this study provide a guideline to estimate component sizes and costs for the optimal operation of the proposed microgrids under various load dispatch scenarios. The simulation results suggest that the Load Following is the best dispatch strategy having the lowest Net Present Cost of 149,794 USD, Levelized Cost of Energy of 0.204 USD/kWh, Operating cost of 3,698 USD and CO2 emission of 3,298 kg/year with a stable power system response. Combined Dispatch is found to be the worst strategy having the maximum Levelized Cost of Energy of 0.532 USD/kWh, Net Present Cost of 415,030 USD, Operating cost of 15,394 USD and Green House Gas emissions of 17,266 kg/year and comparatively poor power system responses. Finally, a brief comparative analysis has been presented between designed microgrid system and other hybrid energy systems and conventional power stations in terms of Levelized Cost of Energy, Net Present Cost, CO2 emissions and operating cost."

"The impact of natural disasters on migration: Findings from Vietnam Climate Change; Decision to Migrate; Small Islands Increasingly, studies are examining whether the incidence of natural disasters influences household migration. This paper examines whether the severity of natural disasters is important for migration decisions in Vietnam, rather than just examining their occurrence. Data for a sample of 1,003 farm households from the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey are examined for the period 2006-2008. A residual generated regressor approach is adopted to isolate the direct impact of disasters on migration from the indirect impact they have on migration through reducing agricultural output and income. Findings suggest that more severe disasters are directly associated with a greater probability of migration. Furthermore, such outcomes are the same for poor households vis-Ã -vis their non-poor counterparts."

"Microbial diversity and characteristics of kombucha as revealed by metagenomic and physicochemical analysis Kombucha; Antioxidant; Gluconacetobacter Liquefaciens Kombucha is a fermented tea made from a Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast (SCOBY) with a long history of use as a health tonic. It is likely that most health benefits come from the tea and fermentation metabolites from specific microbial communities. Despite its growing importance as a functional health drink, the microbial ecosystem present in kombucha has not been fully documented. To characterize the microbial composition and biochemical properties of â€˜The Good Brewâ€™ original base kombucha, we used metagenomics amplicon (16S rRNA and ITS) sequencing to identify the microbial communities at the taxonomic level. We identified 34 genera with 200 microbial species yet described in kombucha. The dominance of organic acid producing microorganisms Acetobacter, Komagataeibacter and Starmerella are healthy for the human gut and their glucose metabolising activities have a putative role in preventing conditions such as diabetes and obesity. Kombucha contains high protein (3.31 Âµg/mL), high phenolic content (290.4 mg/100 mL) and low sugars (glucose: 1.87 g/L; sucrose 1.11 g/L; fructose: 0.05 g/L) as compared to green tea. The broad microbial diversity with proven health benefits for the human gut suggests kombucha is a powerful probiotic. These findings are important to improve the commercial value of kombucha and uncover the immense prospects for health benefits."

"A Generic Framework of Unifying Industrial By-products for Soil Stabilization Soil Cement; Compressive Strength; Calcium Carbide This paper presents a newly proposed generic framework for unifying different industrial by-products (IBPs) as composite binders to potentially replace ordinary Portland cement (OPC) for soft clay stabilization. The concepts of three chemical moduli (TCM) and strength activity index (SAI) are used to determine the fractions of different IBPs, and the final design mix is further tuned by adding gypsum for additional strength gain contributed by density due to ettringite formation. As a case study, a coastal soft clay was stabilized by different IBPs and gypsum using the new generic framework. Results show that the highest unconfined compression strengths of the IBPs stabilized clay cured for 7, 28, and 60 days reach 0.75, 1.21, and 1.39 MPa, respectively, which are even higher than those of the OPC-stabilized counterparts, suggesting the possibility of using IBPs to substitute OPC. Moreover, the additive gypsum plays a beneficial role for more strength gain due to the formation and volumetric expansion of ettringite. The implementation strategy for the new framework is recommended, and its practical implications for soil stabilization are discussed in terms of IBPs recycling and reuse, environmental sustainability, and economic benefits."
"Precariously placed: housing affordability, quality and satisfaction of Australians with disabilities Social Support; Social Care; Direct Payments Access to adequate, safe, secure, accessible and affordable housing is a fundamental human right and one stipulated in the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Australian adults with disabilities experience housing disadvantage including homelessness, poor-quality housing and housing unaffordability; however, we lack a comprehensive comparison of the housing circumstances of people with and without disabilities and differences by impairment type. We analysed data from a nationally representative sample of 11,394 working-aged Australians collected in 2011. We found that people with disabilities experienced disadvantage across all housing indicators, and people with intellectual and psychological disabilities fared worst. These findings suggest that there is a housing crisis for Australians with disabilities, which may intensify with the introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There is a need to develop long-term housing solutions that promote independence, are accessible and affordable, and that consider location and neighbourhood context."

"The Adoption Appraisal of Autonomous Vehicles Robot; Random Trees; Artificial Potential Field This paper presents an application of the multi-attribute decision making (MADM) methodology, intended to determine the levels of the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AV). We have used results of the survey conducted in Saudi Arabia as inputs for MADM. Our approach is based on fuzzy logic, and it incorporates criteria identified by survey responses that influence degree of the new technology acceptance. These criteria are related to the positive outcomes, like reduction of air pollution, environmental sustainability, efficiency and effectiveness of new transport systems and negative issues like high cost and associated risks of the automation. The survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia, where a new futuristic, smart, megacity is being launched. It will be powered by renewable energy with zero emission. We aim to establish if the community, businesses and government are ready to adopt new autonomous driving technology. The model can be used in various applications reliant on multi-attribute constraints, envisioned to obtain a resolution that satisfies all restraints. Results attained by using this methodology and survey were updated considering COVID-19 outbreaks, trends and known impacts on this adoption which is expected to have."
"Global diversity and balancing selection of 23 leading Plasmodium falciparum candidate vaccine antigens Antibodies; Plasmodium Vivax; Malaria Vaccines Investigation of the diversity of malaria parasite antigens can help prioritize and validate them as vaccine candidates and identify the most common variants for inclusion in vaccine formulations. Studies of vaccine candidates of the most virulent human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, have focused on a handful of well-known antigens, while several others have never been studied. Here we examine the global diversity and population structure of leading vaccine candidate antigens of P. falciparum using the MalariaGEN Pf3K (version 5.1) resource, comprising more than 2600 genomes from 15 malaria endemic countries. A stringent variant calling pipeline was used to extract high quality antigen gene 'haplotypes' from the global dataset and a new R-package named VaxPack was used to streamline population genetic analyses. In addition, a newly developed algorithm that enables spatial averaging of selection pressure on 3D protein structures was applied to the dataset. We analysed the genes encoding 23 leading and novel candidate malaria vaccine antigens including csp, trap, eba175, ama1, rh5, and CelTOS. Our analysis shows that current malaria vaccine formulations are based on rare haplotypes and thus may have limited efficacy against natural parasite populations. High levels of diversity with evidence of balancing selection was detected for most of the erythrocytic and pre-erythrocytic antigens. Measures of natural selection were then mapped to 3D protein structures to predict targets of functional antibodies. For some antigens, geographical variation in the intensity and distribution of these signals on the 3D structure suggests adaptation to different human host or mosquito vector populations. This study provides an essential framework for the diversity of P. falciparum antigens to be considered in the design of the next generation of malaria vaccines."
"Gender Equality Prior to and Following Separation: Nordic and Liberal Policy Inconsistencies One Child Policy; Family Planning Policy; Dual-Earner We compare family policy in Australia and Finland, focusing on child support as interrogating how gender equality ideals and realities play out when families diverge from the dual-parent model. Despite Finland's de-gendered leave and employment policy, a gender wage gap continues to position mothers as primary carers. In Australia, pre-separation policies are gendered in that leave benefits position mothers as primary carers. In both countries, child support policy took the opposite approach. Finland's child support policy provides less incentive for the father to take care of children post-separation."

Using a sample of 26 banks from an emerging market (Malaysia), over the period 2003â€“2018, we find that the development of FinTech firms over time increases bank financial stability. We uncover further evidence that FinTech firmsâ€™ impact on bank financial stability holds when we conduct sub-sample analyses by bank size, bank type (Islamic vis-Ã -vis conventional), and level of corporate governance. The results are robust to alternative model specifications, measures of financial stability, and FinTech."

"Scalable dual-layer film with broadband infrared emission for sub-ambient daytime radiative cooling Radiative Cooling; Hot Temperature; Net Radiation As a passive cooling method with no energy input, radiative cooling has great potential in applications like building energy saving. The key to effective radiative cooling lies in selectively controlling the radiative properties in both solar and mid-infrared spectrums, and simple structures based on polymer materials attract growing attentions due to their overwhelming advantages of low cost and large-scalable fabrication. In this study, a dual-layer film consisting of polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) layer and Ag coating is proposed to act as an efficient daytime radiative cooler with low solar absorption and broadband infrared emission. An outdoor test demonstrates that sub-ambient daytime cooling is successfully achieved by the proposed cooler with an equilibrium temperature 2 Â°C below the ambient under solar irradiation of 950 W/m2. Due to better durability and better performance in anti-staining and corrosion protection than other polymer materials, the demonstrated cooling performance based on the PVF film would facilitate radiative cooling principle in much broader applications."

"Micro- and Nanosystems for Advanced Transdermal Delivery Transdermal Drug Administration; Drug Delivery Systems; Needle The skin is the largest and most accessible organ in the human body and, as such, it appears as the most convenient portal for drug delivery. However, the skin is also a formidable barrier which, while protecting us from physical, chemical, and immunological agents, requires appropriate technology for effective delivery. Today, the most effective administration method for large, lipophobic, and polar molecules continues to be hypodermic injection, which is associated with pain, needle phobia, and stick injury. As an alternative, a range of advanced strategies to overcome the skin barrier have been established over the last few decades including chemical enhancement, sonophoresis, iontophoresis, electroporation, thermal ablation, and mechanical approaches. Encouraged by the advances in nanotechnology, micro- and nanosystems have emerged as powerful tools to overcome the skin barrier, enabling significant advances on the existing methods. In particular, microneedle- and nanoparticle-assisted transdermal delivery has gained significant traction and will most likely have a strong impact in the field. In this review, the most recent progress in the field of transdermal delivery based on microneedle and nanoparticle delivery systems is discussed and examples of key therapeutic application are provided. Finally, a critical summary is presented alongside a vision for future research directions."

"Respect@Uni: A feminist insider perspective on respect-based culture change in higher education Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science This article provides feminist insider perspectives on the development and delivery of an innovative respect-based sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH) prevention initiative in higher education. The initiative is designed specifically to address risk factors in graduate research. It is one of the first of its kind world-wide. Respect and cognate, moderate feminist, concepts are increasingly prevalent as oblique, or stealth, approaches to gender equality in contexts in which doing so openly may be counterproductive. The respect-based initiative examined here addresses the various risk factors that distinguish graduate research from undergraduate education, particularly power imbalances. Adopting a feminist reflective practice methodology, we provide an insider perspective into the multi-layered processes involved in enabling and undertaking institution-wide culture change of this kind. Our critical reflections focus on the stealth approaches adopted during design and delivery, highlighting resistance and receptivity to the initiative and how these were either countered or harnessed. The article provides both practical and theoretical insights into the advantages and limitations of respect-based culture-change. Most notably, it contributes to enhanced understanding of what works in practice, for which there is an urgent need."

"How do housing and labour markets affect individual homelessness? Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease We examine the impact of housing and labour market conditions on individual risks of homelessness. Our innovation is a focus on homelessness entries, although findings from jointly estimated homelessness entry and exit probit equations are reported. Risky behaviours and life experiences such as regular use of drugs, the experience of violence and biographies of acute disadvantage lead to a higher risk of becoming homeless. Public housing is a strong protective factor. We find clear evidence that for certain subgroups it is being the â€˜wrong person in the wrong placeâ€™ that matters most when considering risks of entering homelessness. Indigenous Australians, for example, are no more likely to become homeless than other vulnerable groups holding housing and labour market conditions constant. However, tighter housing markets and weaker labour markets expose Indigenous Australians to significantly higher risks of entering homelessness."
"Mitigating spatial conflict of land use for sustainable wetlands landscape in Li-Xia-river region of central Jiangsu, China Ecosystem Health; China; Ecological Civilisation Li-Xia-river Wetlands make up the biggest freshwater marsh in East China. Over the last decades, social and economic developments have dramatically altered the natural wetlands landscape. Mitigating land use conflict is beneficial to protect wetlands, maintain ecosystem services, and coordinate local socioeconomic development. This study employed multi-source data and GIS-based approaches to construct a composite index model with the purpose of quantitatively evaluating the intensity of land use conflict in Li-Xia-river Wetlands from 1978 to 2018. The results showed that the percentage of the wetlandsâ€™ area declined from 20.3% to 15.6%, with an overall reduction rate of 23.2%. The mean index of land use conflict increased from 0.15 to 0.35, which suggests that the conflict intensity changed from â€œno conflictâ€ to â€œmild conflict.â€ The number of severe conflict units increased by about 25 times. A conspicuous spatial variation of land use conflict was observed across different periods, although taking land for agricultural activities was the overriding reason for wetlands reduction. However, in recent years, urban sprawl has posed the greatest threat to Li-Xia-river Wetlands. Coordinating land use conflict and formulating a practical strategy are the initial imperative steps to mitigate the threat to wetlands."

"Investigation of Reaction Mechanism and the Effects of Process Parameters on Ionic Liquid–Based Delignification of Sugarcane Straw Biomass; Delignification; Ethanol Production The delignification of sugarcane straw (SCS) was investigated using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, [Emim][OAc], varying three process parameters such as temperature, residence time, and stirring rate. The maximum degree of delignification was around 63.9% at 90 Â°C for a stirring rate of 1400 rpm and a residence time of 5 h. The 23 full factorial statistical model was well-fitted with the experimental results. Among the 26 solid-liquid reaction mechanisms studied in this study, Zhuravlev, Lesokhin, and Templeman diffusion (i.e., shrinking core/product layer) model was found to be the most suitable model for describing the delignification mechanism of SCS using [Emim][OAc]. When compared with other process parameters, higher temperatures produced low crystalline and low thermally stable recovered cellulose-rich material with high porosity and BET surface area due to higher degree of crystalline cellulose I to amorphous cellulose II transformation. The recovered lignin was of low molecular structure with high content of phenolic OHâˆ’ groups and syringyl units. The recovery of [Emim][OAc] was > 85% with no structural changes.

"Emerging women leaders’ views on political participation in Melanesia Political Representation; Quotas; Parliament Existing explanations for why women do not get elected to parliament in Melanesia emphasize structural barriers to participation, including prohibitive costs and patriarchal norms. They are largely silent, however, on why those women who do conform to the profile of the â€œarchetypal candidate,â€ and thus have the best chance of overcoming these barriers, choose not to run. Drawing on an extensive qualitative dataset, including forty in-depth interviews with emerging women leaders from three Melanesian countries, we find that many women are pessimistic about the way electoral politics are conducted. Echoing longstanding critiques of political practice, this cohort conceptualizes their political activity as being conducted in a parallel public sphere, in contexts in which they consider themselves more able to pursue programmatic reform. Rather than focusing on structural barriers, we explore their decision to eschew parliamentary elections as an act of resistance against politics as usual in Melanesia. This new material adds to the literature on why women chose to run â€œfromâ€ rather than â€œforâ€ parliament and therefore has implications for scholars and practitioners interested in improving womenâ€™s parliamentary representation across the globe."

"Thermal Stability and Oxidation of Group IV Terminated (100) Diamond Surfaces Germanium; Sige; Nanocrystal High resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used to explore the thermal stability of as-prepared and oxidized silicon and germanium-terminated (100) diamond surfaces which form two domain (3 Ã— 1) surface reconstructions. The as-prepared germanium and silicon-terminated surfaces are stable up to 1200 Â°C, making them the most thermally stable surface termination for diamond (100). The oxidized forms of these surfaces can be created via exposure to O2, H2O or atmospheric conditions and retain the (3 Ã— 1) surface symmetry. The thermal stability of the oxidized surfaces exhibit differing behavior. A 700 Â°C anneal is sufficient to liberate oxygen from the germanium-oxide-terminated (100) diamond surface, leaving the pristine germanium-terminated surface, while the silicon-oxide-terminated surface is thermally stable up to 1200 Â°C, at which point both silicon and oxygen are removed."
"When Disaster Strikes! An Interdisciplinary Review of Disasters and Their Organizational Consequences Disaster; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; Terrorist Attack Disasters (e.g., natural catastrophes, pandemics/epidemics, mass violence events, and human/technological errors) are becoming increasingly common due to factors such as growing population density and accelerated climate change. Exposure to any type of disaster is damaging for both individuals and organizations. Disasters deprive individuals of their livelihoods, alter how employees perform their work, and harm individual well-being. For organizations, disasters compromise functioning and profitability, often resulting in organizational failure. As a result, there is growing interest in research linking disaster events to the workplace. Based on an analysis of 260 disaster articles, we offer a comprehensive, systematic, interdisciplinary review of the disaster literature with organizational implications. Employing a resource-based perspective, embedded within an ecological systems framework, we suggest that disaster exposure depletes (or prompts investment of) individual, team, and organizational resources and subsequently impacts organizational outcomes. This theoretical framework can be used to identify the critical research gaps that exist in the literature and offers a promising agenda for future research."

"Gut Akkermansia muciniphila ameliorates metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease by regulating the metabolism of L-aspartate via gut-liver axis Intestine Flora; Ruminococcaceae; Microorganisms The gut bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila has been increasingly recognized for its therapeutic potential in treating metabolic disorders, including obesity, diabetes, and metabolicdysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). However, its underlying mechanism involved in its well-known metabolic actions needs further evaluation. The present study explored the therapeutic effect and mechanism of A. muciniphila in intervening MAFLD by using a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diet induced obese mice model. Mice treated with A. muciniphila efficiently reversed MAFLD in the liver, such as hepatic steatosis, inflammatory, and liver injury. These therapeutic effects persisted after long-term drug withdrawal and were slightly weakened in the antibiotics-treated obese mice. A. muciniphila treatment efficiently increased mitochondrial oxidation and bile acid metabolism in the gut-liver axis, ameliorated oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis in gut, leading to the reshaping of the gut microbiota composition. These metabolic improvements occurred with increased L-aspartate levels in the liver that transported from the gut. The administration of L-aspartate in vitro or in mice displayed the similar beneficial metabolic effects mentioned above and efficiently ameliorated MAFLD. Together, these data indicate that the anti-MAFLD activity of A. muciniphila correlated with lipid oxidation and improved gutâ€“liver interactions through regulating the metabolism of L-aspartate. A. muciniphila could be a potential agent for clinical intervention in MAFLD."

"To eat in peace, share well: A vision of a relational peace from the democratic republic of congo African Philosophy; Ubuntu; Communitarian The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is well known for incidences of violence, human rights violations and injustices. Indeed, ever since its formation as the Congo Free State (1885 to 1908) under King Leopold II of Belgium, the Congo has been imagined as a site of savagery, barbarity and extreme violence, embodying the primal heart of the dark continent of Africa (Dunn 2003). It is less well known that here, like elsewhere throughout Africa, a rich tradition of BÃºmÃ¹ntÃ¹ (authentic Personhood) endures - calling individuals and communities towards a relational peace (of social harmony alongside human dignity for all). Drawing from dialogues conducted in Kamina, the Haut-Lomami Province, this article explores a vision of peace arising from such a tradition. It asks the question - what might the struggle for peace look like if the challenge is understood not as a negative one of ending an ""inherent""violence, but instead as a positive one of extending an existing peace?."
"How do fintech start-ups develop capabilities? Towards a fintech capability Model Alliance Portfolios; Firm; Open Innovation This research investigates how FinTech start-ups, which refer to organisations that offer novel â€œfinancial services or products that are delivered via technologiesâ€, develop capabilities for innovation, survival and scaling. The study draws from the dynamic capabilities theory to investigate how Fintech start-ups not only spur innovations in products, business models and processes but also ensure their sustenance both in the Fintech and financial industry. Empirically, the study uses qualitative case studies with 13 Fintech firms in Australia. The findings identified six clusters of FinTech firms' capabilities that are associated with four broad micro-foundations. Based on these findings, the study contributes a model that illustrates the FinTech capability development process."
"Artificial Intelligence in food system redesign ? Designing for the benefit of the whole (Student: Stephanie Camarena) The future of humanity is urban with a predicted 66% of people living in cities by 2050. However, with the sprawl of cities, agricultural knowledge is lost and the disconnection from the source of food growing emphasises issues of waste, resilience, food security and health. Climate change is adversely impacting the production of food in Australia whether in terms of quantity, quality and altogether availability.

Providing alternative and sustainable food systems requires an increased connectivity between demand and supply, the valorisation of local products, stewardship and local knowhow. Better models and techniques could support a way for local consumption to more closely match the production available or the production capacity in urban and peri-urban areas.

The research will develop a model based on a series of case studies using artificial intelligence (AI) applied to different parts of the food system. The system design thinking methods will allow observations and findings on how redesigning part of the food system can
improve the benefits of the whole and how adopting a service system design from the start might change the problem formulation. The proposed model could help evaluate city food policies and future planning and bring a clearer understanding of how habits and purchases
are directly linked to sustainable outcomes."
"Assessing critical infrastructure resilience in terms of its service-providing capacity in coastal Bangladesh: A synthesis of geospatial techniques and social responses Bangladesh; Cyclonic Storms; Disaster Lack of adequate infrastructure, especially in the coastal regions of developing countries, limits the capacity of households to prevent, cope with, and recover from the adverse effects of natural hazards. The services provided by critical infrastructure (CI) contribute to the overall resilience of marginalized coastal households to natural hazards. CI, in turn, may itself be resilient (or not). Resilient CI is capable of providing services to meet the community's demand for that service. This research developed and tested an innovative framework for assessing CI resilience in terms of services it was capable to provide to coastal residents in three separate phases (before, during, and after) of Cyclone Sidr, using empirical evidence from a coastal sub-district of Bangladesh. The disaster-phase-wise level of demand for these services was identified using GIS-based network analysis combined with community rankings of service importance across the disaster phases. Households were surveyed to determine whether they were able to procure CI services in each phase. A comparison of service demand levels with success in procuring CI services was used to assess CI resilience. The results revealed spatio-temporal variation in the service provision of existing CI units to households in the study area. A mixed trend was indicated: less exposed communities contained a somewhat higher percentage of service-receiving households than more exposed communities during the pre- and post-disaster phases, whereas the percentage was higher in the more exposed communities during the syn-disaster phase. This approach has the potential to determine whether the existing CI in a community is resilient enough to support the population in the different phases of a cyclone. The results could guide planners to bolster CI resilience for communities, thereby also improving community resilience to natural hazards."

"Living liveable? RESIDE's evaluation of the “Liveable Neighborhoods” planning policy on the health supportive behaviors and wellbeing of residents in Perth, Western Australia Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Background: The RESIDential Environments (RESIDE) project is a unique longitudinal natural experiment designed to evaluate the health impacts of the â€œLiveable Neighbourhoodsâ€ planning policy, which was introduced by the Western Australian government to create more walkable suburbs. Objectives: To summarize the RESIDE evidence of the impact of the planning policy on a range of health-supportive behaviours and wellbeing outcomes and to assess the consistency and direction of the estimates of associations. Methods: An audit of 26 RESIDE research papers (from 2003 to 2012) identified the number of positive associations (statistically significant and consistent with policy expectations), negative associations (statistically significant and inconsistent with policy expectations), and null findings from multiple-exposure models between objective and perceived measures of 20 policy design requirements and 13 health-supportive behaviors and wellbeing outcomes. Results: In total 332 eligible estimates of associations (n = 257 objective measures and n = 75 perceived measures) were identified. Positively significant findings were detected for: 57% of walking estimates with objectively measured policy design features (negative = 3%; null = 40%) (n = 115) and 54% perceived measures (negative = 0%; null = 33%) (n = 27); 42% of sense of community estimates with objectively measured of policy design features (negative = 8%; null = 50%) (n = 12) and 61% perceived measures (negative = 8%; null = 31%) (n = 13); 39% of safety or crime-related estimates with objectively measured of policy design features (negative = 22%; null = 39%) (n = 28) and 100% perceived measures (n = 7). All (n = 4) estimates for mental health outcomes with objectively measured policy-related design features were positively significant. Conclusions: The synthesis of findings suggests that new suburban communities built in accordance with the â€œLiveable Neighbourhoodsâ€ policy have the potential to encourage health supportive behaviors and wellbeing outcomes including transport and recreation walking, and to create neighborhoods with a stronger sense of community where residents may feel safer."

"Quantitation of carotenoids and fatty acids from Atlantic salmon using a portable Raman device Astaxanthine; Pigmentation; Diet Raman spectroscopy can be a useful tool for performing non-destructive subsurface measurements, allowing for investigations on intact foods that would otherwise require food products to be prepared for analysis, thus creating food waste, and often requiring the addition of chemicals. To overcome this, we have developed a method to measure the concentration of pigment (astaxanthin) and fatty acids in whole, unfilleted Atlantic salmon through the skin using defocused Raman spectroscopy. Subsurface measurements were performed across different regions of Atlantic salmon. PLS regression of the measured spectra gave a moderate correlation between Raman bands and astaxanthin concentration (R2 = 0.5797) and good correlations for fatty acid concentrations (total, saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, trans; R2 = 0.7457 to 0.8249). This work shows that subsurface Raman measurements can provide useful quantitative information regarding important quality parameters (pigment and fatty acid concentrations) that can aid with production in aquaculture."

"Biotinylated Mn3O4 nanocuboids for targeted delivery of gemcitabine hydrochloride to breast cancer and MRI applications Gadolinium Oxide; Contrast Media; Magnetic Resonance Imaging Multifunctional nanocarriers have been found as potential candidate for the targeted drug delivery and imaging applications. Herein, we have developed a biocompatible and pH-responsive manganese oxide nanocuboid system, surface modified with poly (ethylene glycol) bis(amine) and functionalized with biotin (Biotin-PEG-MNCs), for an efficient and targeted delivery of an anticancer drug (gemcitabine, GEM) to the human breast cancer cells. GEM-loaded Biotin-PEG@MNCs showed high drug loading efficiency, controlled release of GEM and excellent storage stability in the physiological buffers and different temperature conditions. GEM-loaded Biotin-PEG@MNCs showed dose- and time-dependent decrease in the viability of human breast cancer cells. Further, it exhibited significantly higher cell growth inhibition than pure GEM which suggested that Biotin-PEG@MNCs has efficiently delivered the GEM into cancerous cells. The role of biotin in the uptake was proved by the competitive binding-based cellular uptake study. A significant decrease in the amount of manganese was observed in biotin pre-treated cancer cells as compared to biotin untreated cancer cells. In MRI studies, Biotin-PEG-MNCs showed both longitudinal and transverse relaxivity about 0.091 and 7.66 mMâˆ’1 sâˆ’1 at 3.0 T MRI scanner, respectively. Overall, the developed Biotin-PEG-MNCs presents a significant potential in formulation development for cancer treatment via targeted drug delivery and enhanced MRI contrast imaging properties."

"Hidden in Plain Sight: Building Visibility for Critical Gender Perspectives Exploring Markets, Marketing and Society Marketing; Consumer Culture; Netnography In this introduction to the special issue on gender and macromarketing, we explore how gender research within the journal has remained â€œhidden in plain sightâ€; and, offer concrete proposals to build visibility for critical gender perspectives which explore markets, marketing and society. This introduction is divided into four sections. First, we examine existing research in the journal which has focused on gender. Next, we provide a summary of the eight articles published in this special issue. We then examine systemic gender inequalities and injustices currently evidenced within macromarketing. Finally, we proffer suggestions for future gender research directions within the journal, alongside our reflections on addressing the problematic gendered dynamics that persist within the journal and the Macromarketing Society."

"Alginate-immobilised algal wastewater treatment enhanced by species selection Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Immobilisation of algae by entrapment in alginate beads enables rapid nitrogen and phosphorus removal from wastewater and simplifies biomass harvesting for resource recovery. The alginate beads provide a protected environment for algal cultivation, enabling a species to be selected with less risk of contamination occurring during wastewater treatment. Immobilised Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus abundans, Selenastrum capricornutum and Coelastrum microporum were compared in terms of the nutrient uptake capacity of each bead with the aim of selecting the species with highest uptake and so reducing the operational cost of bead generation. The N:P ratio assimilated from the wastewater varied markedly between species and was not affected by cultivation in N-depleted or P-depleted medium before immobilisation. This indicated species could be selected based on the relative importance of N or P removal for the site, or tailored to the wastewater, with C. vulgaris (cellular N:P of 6.1 Â± 0.2) and S. abundans (2.6 Â± 0.1) best suited for wastewater with a high and low N:P ratio, respectively. S. abundans adapted best to the restricted growth environment of the alginate matrix, assimilated the most P per cell (reducing interference of wastewater PO43âˆ’ with the Ca-alginate structure), and thus led to the most durable beads during semi-continuous treatment of wastewater. This species gave the longest treatment duration of 42 days and algal cell production of 1.36 Â± 0.7 Ã— 107 cells/bead. S. abundans also achieved the greatest nutrient removal capacity (101 Â± 8 Î¼g N/bead and 45.9 Â± 1.9 Î¼g P/bead), demonstrating that the cost of alginate bead supply per unit of nutrient removed could be reduced and potential resource recovery from the biomass increased."

"How are gender inequality and violence against women related? Findings from a population-level community attitudes survey Child Care; Time Use; Domestic Division of Labour Low support for gender equality (GE) predicts attitudes supporting violence against women (VAW). However, little is known about the influence of attitudes toward different manifestations of GE. This study extends knowledge by assessing the relative strength of attitudes to GE across seven theoretically derived dimensions, and their association with attitudes toward VAW. 17,542 Australians participated in the 2017 National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women Survey. Population means were calculated for the following scales formed from survey questions: the Community Attitudes Supportive of Violence Against Women Scale (CASVAWS), the Gender Equality Attitudes Scale (GEAS) and measures within the GEAS representing the theoretical dimensions. There was variation in support for GE between the measures. The lower the support for GE, the higher the support for VAW. Although all GEAS measures included in regression modelling contributed to variance in the CASVAWS, two accounted for more than half. The study suggests benefits in using a multidimensional model of GE to mitigate cultural support for VAW, with emphasis on the private sphere and countering hostility toward women and rigid gender roles and identities."

"A model for mental health advance directives in the new Victorian Mental Health and Wellbeing Act Human Rights; Chief Justice; Statutory Interpretation Under the Victorian 2014 Mental Health Act (MHA14), Victorians have a right to advance statements. While there have been initiatives to support uptake, under 3% of consumers have done so. In March 2021, the Royal Commission into Victoriaâ€™s Mental Health System (the Commission) released its report, including a call to repeal MHA14 and enact a new Act no later than mid-2022. In this paper, we discuss the role of advance planning documentation and instruments used in Australian legislation. Drawing on the Commissionâ€™s recommendations, models of advance planning in Australia and the Victorian legislative context, this paper proposes a model of both binding and non-binding advance directives. This model would bring the rights of Victorian consumers into alignment with rights provided under the Medical Treatment, Planning and Decisions Act 2016 (Vic) and assist in bringing the new Act into compatibility with the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic)."

"Microplastics and pollutants in biosolids have contaminated agricultural soils: An analytical study and a proposal to cease the use of biosolids in farmlands and utilise them in sustainable bricks Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Treated waste-water sludge (biosolids) are frequently recycled in agricultural lands; however, this practice has polluted soils with microplastics (MPs), nanoplastics (NPs), synthetics, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals and engineered nanoparticles. This study analyses many of the significant research outcomes in this area and proposes the urgent reduction of biosolids recycling in farmlands, aiming to eliminate their use altogether as soon as practicable, and instead, to utilise this material as a source of brick firing energy in the manufacturing of fired clay bricks and as a replacement for virgin brick soil. Based on a comprehensive data analysis, this study has calculated that in the European Union, the United States, China, Canada and Australia, approximately 26,042, 21,249, 13,660, 1,518 and 1,241 tonnes of microplastics, respectively, are added to farmlands annually as a result of biosolids application. The accumulation of microplastics produces detrimental effects on soil organisms and increases the accumulation of other micropollutants, such as heavy metals. The degradation of MPs over time is a source for the creation of nanoplastics, which pose a greater threat to ecosystems and human and animal health, as their size allows for their absorption into plant cells. On the other hand, the results of a comprehensive study at RMIT, including a comprehensive Life-Cycle Assessment, confirm that recycling biosolids in fired clay bricks (Bio-Bricks) is a promising sustainable alternative. This study proposes the mandatory addition of 7% biosolids in all brick manufacturing worldwide to utilize all biosolids production in fired clay bricks. This will reduce brick firing energy by over 12.5%."
"Decent work for sustainable development in post-crisis Nepal: Social policy challenges and a way forward Welfare Regimes; Public Policy; Nepal Although the Decent Work agenda has received significant attention in the context of sustainable development, the formulation and implementation of appropriate social policies in developing countries remain an underexplored subject. This article responds to this gap and traces country-specific Decent Work related policies and programs in Nepalâ€”which is recovering from two major crises: a decade-long armed conflict that ended in 2006 as well as the 2015 earthquake. Drawing on Critical Policy Analysis framework, this article examines how key tenets of the International Labour Organisation's Decent Work platform, namely creation and provision of employment, social protection, social dialogue and rights at work have manifested in Nepal. The findings indicate that while attempts have been made to embrace the Decent Work agenda into social policies and programs, structural instability of political processes means that there is a lack of strategic directions to address a capacity deficit specific to the informal sector and outbound labour migrants. The article makes broader analytical contributions towards evaluating the implementation of social policies driven by the global priority in the context of developing nations with weak governance settings. In countries like Nepal, where the majority of workers are located within the informal sector and as such the administrative reach and effectiveness of Decent Work related social policies designed for the formal sector are limited."

"Passengers’ perception of safety and its relationship with demographics, service quality, satisfaction and loyalty in airlines sector - A case study of Vietnam to Australia route SERVQUAL; Loyalty; Consumer Satisfaction Our understanding of airline passengers' perception of safety and its association with their satisfaction and airline service quality measures is limited in the literature. This study aims to conduct a systematic examination of airline passengersâ€™ perception of safety and its association with demographics attributes, service quality measures, overall satisfaction and loyalty by using Vietnam to Australia route as a case study. We conducted a questionnaire survey of 436 respondents travelling on a full-service airline flying from Vietnam to Australia. Only 53.4% of respondents feel safe while travelling in the airline while 28.9% feel neutral safe and 17.7% feel unsafe. We found that the four service quality measures of SERVQUAL model (Tangibles, Reliability, Assurance and Empathy) and airline specific measures (Flight Experience, Ground Service, Airline Employees and Flight Schedule) had significant effects on the passengers' perception of safety. Also, respondents' differences in educational qualification, frequency of travel, ticket types and the membership of frequent flyer program (FFP) had a significant effect on their perception of safety. Likewise, passengersâ€™ overall satisfaction and loyalty to the airline also had a significant effect on the perception of safety. No effects on the perception of safety were found for differences in gender, age, nationality, income and purpose of travel. Although all airlines flying in and out of Australia must meet Australia's Safety Management System regulations and requirements, our findings emphasize the importance of understanding the relationship between passengers' perception of safety and their satisfaction. There is an opportunity for the airline operator to secure a lead in the market share of air travel by improving service quality measures that can influence passengers' perception of safety."

"Chemosensation in Ascaris infection (administered by University of Melbourne) During invasion, many parasitic helminths (worms) migrate through a number of host tissues and organs before reaching their final infection site. This process is essential and can be targeted for novel methods of parasite control. We have identified chemosensory activity during migration by the giant pig roundworm, Ascaris suum, during migration through the host liver and lung. We will use a combination of cutting-edge imaging, systems biology, chemical biology and microfluidic methods rooted in classical parasitology to explore Ascaris chemosensation during larval migration, identify the key host queues and parasite genes regulating this process, and probe helminth chemosensation as a novel target for anti-parasitic treatments."
"Design and demonstration of an islanded hybrid microgrid for an enormous motel with the appropriate solicitation of superfluous energy by using iHOGA and matlab Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems The urge for Electrical Power is escalating regularly at an increased rate due to the internationalization and progression of civilization. However, proper economic consumption of additional energy produced from the Islanded Hybrid Microgrid System (IHMS) that has not been consumed by the load is a major challenge globally. To overcome the above mentioned summon, this research focuses on a multi-optimal combination of stand-alone IHMS for Tioman Motel located at Tioman Island, Malaysia with an efficient exertion of redundant energy. To avail of this excess energy efficiently, an electrical heater along with a storage tank has been designed concerning diversion load having proper energy management. Furthermore, the system design has adopted the improved hybrid optimization by genetic algorithms (IHOGA) software for profitable and practical analysis of the designated configuration. Moreover, the optimal size of every module has been tested and analyzed through MATLAB Simulink and stabilized the whole system by representing the values of 1297 and 15 096 kW have been determined as the approximated peak and average load per day for the Motel, respectively. Moreover, the optimized IHMS is comprehended of Photovoltaic (PV) cells, Diesel Generator, Wind Turbine, Battery, and Converter. Adjacent to this, the optimized system ensued in having a net present cost (NPC) of $19.77 million, Renewable Fraction (RF) of 23%, cost of energy (COE) of $0.175/kWh, CO2 of 1 726 825 kg/year and excess energy of 532.26MWh per annum. Whereas, the system involved with the diesel generator lead a COE of $0.315/kWh, CO2 of 6 213 353 kg/year and NPC of $22.12 million. Additionally, this design alone with diesel generator has a higher CO2 emission rate, COE and NPC compared to optimized IHMS. On the other hand, the amount of excess energy is effectively utilized with an electrical heater as a diversion load."

"Characterising sedimentation velocity of primary waste water solids and effluents Wastewater Treatment; Clarifiers; Baffles Sedimentation in waste water is a heavily studied topic, but mainly focused on hindered and compression settling in secondary sludge, a largely monodispersed solids, where bulk sedimentation velocity is effectively described by functions such as double Vesilind (Takacs). However, many waste water solids, including primary sludge and anaerobic digester effluent are polydispersed, for which application of velocity functions is not well understood. These systems are also subject to large concentration gradients, and poor availability of settling velocity functions has limited design and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis of these units. In this work, we assess the use of various sedimentation functions in single and multi-dimensional domains, comparing model results against multiple batch settling tests at a range of high and low concentrations. Both solids concentration and sludge bed height (interface) over time are measured and compared. The method incorporates uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo regression, DIRECT (dividing rectangles), and Newton optimisation. It was identified that a double Vesilind (Takacs) model was most effective in the dilute regime (<1%v/v), but could not effectively fit high solids concentrations (>1%v/v) without a substantial (50%) decrease in effective maximum sedimentation velocity (V0). Other parameters (Rh, Rp) did not change. A power law velocity model (Diehl) was significantly less predictive at low concentrations, and not significantly better at higher concentrations. The optimised model (with reduction in V0) was tested vs a standard (optimised) double Vesilind velocity model in a simple primary sedimentation unit, and resulted in deviation from -12% to +18% in solids capture prediction from underload to overload (washout) conditions, indicating that the effect is important in CFD based analysis of these systems."
"The Contested Politics of Drought, Water Security and Climate Adaptation in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Droughts are intensifying in many mid-latitude river basins due to climate change; therefore understanding the influence of droughts on water policy is crucial. This study of the politics of water reforms in Australiaâ€™s Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) analyses contrasting discourses of water security during the Millennium Drought (1996-2010). The paper traces the historical evolution, mobilisation and effects of three discourses defined as 'drought-proofing', 'higher value use' and 'river restoration'. These are broadly aligned with engineering, economics and ecological perspectives, and while all discourses were integrated into government responses to the drought, the resurgence of drought-proofing significantly altered policy settings intended to shift MDB water management onto a more sustainable path. The paper illustrates the political and physical conditioning of water policy, placing drought responses in their historical context. The analysis demonstrates how policy actors used discourses of water security to define normative goals and legitimise policies, particularly when climatic extremes provide opportunities to influence policy outcomes. The paper provides three key insights for water governance and climate adaptation: first, drought responses can have far-reaching effects for water governance and policy trajectories; second, droughts pose challenges to positive climate adaptation when they revitalise heroic drought-proofing initiatives; and third, understanding the historical roots of contemporary drought responses is vital for effective climate adaptation"

Influenza A viral infection and pregnancy complications Pregnant women who contract influenza are 5 times more likely to be hospitalised than the general population. Babies of mothers with influenza are also associated with increased perinatal mortality rates. We hypothesise that influenza infection in pregnancy significantly impairs the maternal vascular system resulting in maternal and foetal morbidity. Outcomes from this research may change current treatment modalities to improve maternal and foetal outcomes complicated by influenza infection.
"Slag waste incorporation in high early strength concrete as cement replacement: Environmental impact and influence on hydration & durability attributes Concrete Aggregates; Construction and Demolition Waste; Mechanical Properties This paper investigates the effects of incorporating slag waste (Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag; GGBS) as cement replacement in high early strength concrete. GGBS was used in various replacement ratios and resulting properties of the developed concretes were evaluated. Compressive strength, heat of hydration and shrinkage were determined for evaluating hydration attributes while chloride penetrability and carbonation resistance were investigated for studying the durability-related characteristics of the resulting concretes. The optimum ratio of GGBS as SCM has been determined, in this study, as 30% at which there is merely an average strength decline of 11% while reducing the total carbon dioxide emissions by 30%. Similarly, at this replacement level, the decreased chloride ion penetrability (15%) and higher carbonation resistance (3%) further encourage its use in precast concrete incorporating (HESC). Finally, the beneficial effects of using slag waste in concrete were quantified by determining associated CO2 emissions. It is concluded that slag incorporation in concrete significantly reduces the CO2 emissions, (up to 68%) depending on the cement replacement level, thus promoting green construction and sustainable development."

"Careful Digital Kinship: Understanding Multispecies Digital Kinship, Choreographies of Care and Older Adults During the Pandemic in Australia Economics; Dutch Disease; Emigration and Immigration During the pandemic many aspects of our life were recalibrated through the digital - highlighting the paradoxes of the digital for both empowerment and exploitation. In particular, the pandemic demonstrated the increasing role of the digital in shaping, and being shaped by, kinship. Kinship is a complex term that captures our relationality, intimacies and connections. Kinship is always in action, always becoming. Throughout the pandemic, some cohorts such as older adults (65 years +) were disproportionally disadvantaged due to the uneven digital literacies skills. In this article I expand upon the role of digital kinship as part of human and more-than-human choreography of (informal) care for older adults in Australia. I also reflect on the role of creative forms of knowledge transmission such as illustrations and placemaking games to curate public awareness and enact change."

"Warm stratification and optimised temperatures improve conservation of the endangered orchid, Caladenia robinsonii (Orchidaceae) Germination; Tulasnella; Cephalanthera Context: Maximising seed germination and seedling development is critical for conservation of endangered plants around the world. Orchidaceae is one of the most threatened plant families and can be one of the most difficult to propagate ex situ. Three critical, but potentially limiting, factors are important for orchid germination, namely, conducive conditions, 'ready-to-germinate' seed and effective mycorrhizal fungi. Aims: Our aim was to improve poor germination in vitro of a recalcitrant Australian endangered orchid, Caladenia robinsonii, and to predict the potential impacts of climate change on this species. Methods: Three experiments were conducted to optimise germination in C. robinsonii, with a focus on temperature. In Experiment 1, on the basis of meteorological data, three constant temperatures (15Â°C, 20Â°C and 27Â°C) were tested. In Experiment 2, the optimal constant temperature was compared with diurnally varying temperatures of 22Â°C/18Â°C (12/12 h), with and without warm stratification at 30Â°C/27Â°C (12/12 h) for 1 week. In Experiment 3, the same diurnally varying temperature and warm stratification were tested using multiple orchid mycorrhizal fungal isolates cultured from wild and re-introduced populations of C. robinsonii. Key results: Without warm stratification, germination was greatest at 20Â°C (21%), but only 4% of seedlings developed to the green-leaf stage, whereas fungal growth was greatest at 27Â°C. Stratification increased germination (79%) and development to the green-leaf stage (47%), but more so with subsequent incubation under constant 20Â°C than diurnal 22Â°C/18Â°C. Fungal isolate affected total germination (53-69%) and development to the green-leaf stage (26-41%); isolates from the wild population were less effective than were those from re-introductions. Conclusions: Warm stratification and specific seasonal temperatures significantly improved germination, both factors being typical of seeds with physiological dormancy. Implications: Mimicking in situ conditions can provide a strong basis for ex situ germination strategies and predicting future outcomes. Winter-spring flowering orchid seedlings are commonly observed in autumn, and warm stratification should be considered for improving germination of similar orchid species. However, future climate warming may reduce in situ seedling recruitment."

"Palm oil biomass global supply chain: Environmental emissions vs. technology development of maritime transportation Biomass; Supply Chain Design; Biomass Power To accomplish the climate-neutrality objective by 2050, it is necessary to increase the share of renewable energy sources globally. A significant portion of this burden should be carried by palm oil biomass. However, the palm oil biomass supply may not be large enough to satisfy the rising demand worldwide. International trade and maritime transportation networks may play a significant role in satisfying the objectives defined for biomass renewable energy worldwide. In this context, seaports play a major part in developing palm oil global biomass supply chains (GBSC). This study aims to fill the research gap by investigating the effects of ship technology developments (capacity and size), shipment distance, and mass flow of the palm oil GBSC on environmental emissions. To achieve this goal, a novel dynamic simulation model is developed and tested on two leading palm oil suppliers: Malaysia and Indonesia. The results show to what extent container ship technologies such as size and capacity would affect the environmental emissions in the next 30 years."

"Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence and CSR: Radical Feminist Theory and a Human Rights Perspective Fair Trade; Global Value Chains; Global Production Networks This paper extends Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) scholarship to focus on issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence. Despite a significant body of work on gender and CSR from a variety of feminist perspectives, long-standing evidence of sexual harassment and sexual violence in business, particularly in global value chains, and the rise of the #MeToo movement, there has been little scholarship focused specifically on these issues in the context of CSR. Our conceptual paper addresses this gap in the literature through two key contributions. First, we extend the theoretical base of CSR scholarship by drawing upon and explicating radical feminist theory, a resource that has been underutilized in the field to date. This theoretical perspective is well placed to offer insights around the issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence, and to explain the centrality of these concerns to the gender equality agenda in business and in CSR. Second, building upon insights from radical feminism, and from research on CSR and human rights, we explicate a business and human rights approach to sexual harassment, sexual violence and CSR. We point to ways in which this approach might be more effective in addressing these issues than previously adopted strategies and suggest directions for future research arising from our analysis."

"Air Pollution and Tourism: Evidence from G20 Countries Snow Making; Skiing; Skis Theoretically, it is well argued that environmental factors affect the growth of the tourism industry; however, from an empirical perspective, some gaps still exist in the literature. We empirically examine the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions on tourist arrivals in a panel of G20 countries. Using annual data from 1995 to 2014 and a series of panel data models, our results suggest that the growth of both CO2 and PM2.5 emissions adversely affects international tourist arrivals. The results also show that the observed effect of CO2 emissions is more pronounced in developed economies, while the effect of PM2.5 emissions is stronger for developing economies. Given these findings, our study provides and discusses a number of policy and practical implications."

"Fiscal decentralisation and economic growth in Malaysia: A Market preserving federalism perspective Fiscal Decentralization; Federalism; China By using fiscal datasets from 1990 to 2010 in Malaysia, a panel Dynamic-OLS (DOLS) is employed to investigate the extent to which fiscal decentralisation can support state level economic growth as proposed in the Market preserving federalism (MPF) theory. Despite having a more centralised federalism system, the result strongly shows that a fiscal decentralisation variable (a composite ratio of decentralisation) has significant coefficient and positive relationship with state economic growth. This implies that a certain degree of fiscal decentralisation in Malaysia is able to contribute to states' economic performance by adopting fiscal decentralisation simultaneously on both dimensions of revenue and expenditure as this validates the view that decentralisation is a multi dimentional measure. The study shows that Malaysia also would be able to benefit from a system of federalism which empowers state governments to make policies for their jurisdictions and to compete with one another for better services and higher investment. Hence, competition is the mechanism that creates incentives that result from satisfying the MPF conditions and subsequently leading to the achievement of higher regional economic performance."

"The business case for social housing as infrastructure Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Business cases and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) are conventional features of infrastructure decision-making processes in Australia, and are used to evaluate the societal benefit of proposed projects. However, business cases and CBA have been contentious in terms of design and deployment. Funding commitments are regularly made prior to the completion of business cases and CBA, diminishing their value as a decisive part of infrastructure development decisions. For social housing, business case and CBA processes could provide useful evidence of the wider societal benefits of social housing provision, but the nature of contemporary policy decision-making means that political will remains an important factor in investment decisions. The development of public infrastructure appraisal methods such as CBA can be understood as a consequence of long-term infrastructure investment creating a demand for improvements in assessment and increased analytical capacity in the public and private sector, in the context of competition for funding. This indicates a degree of circularity: ongoing funding to support sector expansion is important in promoting economic analysis in the social housing sector, which is also seen as a step towards increasing industry funding. There is a presumed association between infrastructure provision and economic productivity within appraisal processes and infrastructure agency remits. This relationship is recognised by public servants and representatives from the social housing sector, indicating that infrastructure conceptualisations may not be appropriate for arguing for housing as a welfare intervention, but more apt for proposals that generate employment outcomes, such as key-worker housing. Therefore, the pertinent question is not whether social housing is infrastructure, but whether such a conceptualisation is the best standpoint from which to found advocacy for increased social housing investment. The answer to this question depends on the purpose of the intervention. The resources required to develop appraisal methodologies and analytical capacities underscore the importance of choosing an appropriate basis for further development of social housing business case methodologies. Alternatives to conventional infrastructure CBA methodologies include: avoided costs financial appraisal; a public welfare conceptualisation; and the proposition that the whole of society values providing for those in need. These examples provide a stronger conceptual link to the welfare focus of the social housing. It is also possible that adopting social housing as infrastructure as a central argument for business cases may risk diverting funding to new areas of intervention, rather than increasing funding for providing housing for those most in need."
"Associations between microplastic pollution and land use in urban wetland sediments Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Microplastic pollution is concerning because it is widespread in aquatic environments and there is growing evidence of negative biological effects. Here, we present one of the first studies to examine microplastic pollution (plastic particles < 1 mm) in urban wetlands and investigate relationships between contamination and urban land use. Sediment samples were collected from 20 independent urban wetlands, each with different types of urban land use within their catchments. Microplastics were observed at all wetlands, with an average abundance of around 46 items/kg of dry sediment. Plastic fragments were the most common type of microplastic, accounting for 68.5% of all microplastics found. Consistent with other studies, microplastic abundance was positively correlated with increased catchment urbanisation. On closer examination, plastic fragments and beads correlated with catchment urbanisation. Fragment abundance also increased in wetlands with catchments that had a higher proportion of industrial land use and decreased in catchments with higher residential densities. This study demonstrates the susceptibility of urban wetlands to microplastic pollution, further highlighting the ubiquitous nature of microplastic pollution. The prevalence of microplastic fragments indicates that plastic litter degradation is a significant source of microplastics in urban environments, especially in industrial areas."

"Open Forest: Data, Stories, and Walking-With Anthropocene; Climate Change; Environment Crisis Open Forest is a collective, experimental inquiry into different forests and more-than-human dataflows. The project explores how forests and forest data can be produced, thought of and engaged with otherwise, in co-creative ways that consider perspectives of diverse forest creatures and reach beyond geo-engineering, techno-solutionist perspectives. In this Situated Action, we build on our previous Open Forest activities organized in different parts of the world and take an experimental, hybrid walk in a local forest area in Newcastle followed by a co-creation of forest stories. Through these engagements, we hope to entangle the existing, mostly quantitative forests datasets with more messy and abstract data to question the currently available understandings about the forest as a resource to be used. Our aim is to support collective imagination and care-full sustainability actions towards flourishing more-than-human futures."
"Thermal imaging potential and limitations to predict healing of venous leg ulcers Diabetic Foot; Wounds And Injuries; Wound Healing Area analysis of thermal images can detect delayed healing in diabetes foot ulcers, but not venous leg ulcers (VLU) assessed in the home environment. This study proposes using textural analysis of thermal images to predict the healing trajectory of venous leg ulcers assessed in home settings. Participants with VLU were followed over twelve weeks. Digital images, thermal images and planimetry of wound tracings of the ulcers of 60 older participants was recorded in their homes by nurses. Participants were labelled as healed or unhealed based on status of the wound at the 12th week follow up. The weekly change in textural features was computed and the first two principal components were obtained. 60 participants (aged 80.53 Â± 11.94 years) with 72 wounds (mean area 21.32 Â± 51.28cm2) were included in the study. The first PCA of the change in textural features in week 2 with respect to week 0 were statistically significant for differentiating between healed and unhealed cases. Textural analysis of thermal images is an effective method to predict in week 2 which venous leg ulcers will not heal by week 12 among older people whose wounds are being managed in their homes."
"Particle-Gaseous pollutant emissions and cost of global biomass supply chain via maritime transportation: Full-scale synergy model Biomass; Supply Chain Design; Biomass Power Environmental and economic issues in the maritime transportation and logistics industry have historically received less stakeholder attention than aviation and overland freight sectors. Stakeholders in the port industry have gradually started paying attention to emissions and cost issues across all the sectors, such as supply chains. Global biomass supply chain is one of the main sectors which has not been addressed in published literature. To address this gap, this study aims to develop a dynamic full-scale synergy model to assess cost-mass flow, particulate matter emissions, and air pollutants for maritime transportation of the global crude palm oil biomass supply chain. Focusing on leading producers of palm oil worldwide, we have analyzed a total of 93 sea routes from Malaysia and Indonesia to main export markets in the US, Europe, and Asia. The analysis distinguishes three freight categories: light, medium-weight, and heavy for different sizes of capacity and types of container ships based on the twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU). The findings highlight the dependency of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions level on other factors such as technology, size, and mass flow used for container ships. The results also show a strong relationship between GHG emitted and the type of container ship in a systemic view. A ship with higher TEU contributes to the higher transported amount and lower GHG emissions in the long term. To conclude, the results would increase port industry stakeholdersâ€™ understanding of developing energy policies and managerial strategies for low cost and low carbon fuels technologies."

"Assessing environmental impact of textile supply chain using life cycle assessment methodology Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing The environmental impact of textile supply chain of selected cotton, wool and polyester apparels consumed in Australia was accessed in this study using life cycle assessment methodology. The environmental impact category, climate change was used for this assessment. Climate change is related to the emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and the reference unit of climate change impact category is kg CO2 equivalent. The environmental impact of these apparels was then scaled up based on their total consumption in Australia in 2015. The results highlight the differences in environmental impact between the three apparels. This study demonstrates that the main contributor to climate change is the consumer use stage for cotton and polyester apparel whereas wool apparel production process contributes more impact than consumer use stage. Energy use is the main factor of environmental impact. Sensitivity analysis was carried out based on the different parameters used to develop baseline model, such as change of transport from airfreight to sea freight; change of transport distance, change of consumer laundering behaviour. Around 10% CO2 equivalent emission can be reduced from base case by reducing washing machine energy up to 40%. A high efficient washing machine and full load machine wash can save energy and reduce carbon emission."
"Are Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers Associated with Reductions in Poverty and Improvements in Well-being? Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations Should Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) be the tool for implementing the new Sustainable Development Goals, as they were for the Millennium Development Goals? Surprisingly, despite the controversies around them, there has never been a quantitative evaluation of PRSPs. This paper estimates the impact of having a PRSP on various targets of the Millennium Development Goals. Results suggest that countries under PRSP treatment achieve much greater reductions than control countries, in head count poverty and infant mortality, while also achieving greater improvements in primary school enrolments and gender parity."

"Differences between Students from Senior High School and Vocational School in the Learning Outcomes of Electrical Engineering Students Classroom Experiments; Academic Performance; Attendance Senior High Schools (SMA) and Vocational High Schools (SMK) are high school levels whose output can direct graduates into the workforce or have them continue to the tertiary level. The two types of high schools certainly have different curricula. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a difference between students from SMA and SMK in the learning outcomes of Electrical Engineering students at the Universitas Negeri Surabaya. The method used in this research is the quantitative method, by comparing the learning outcomes of students from SMA and SMK with the learning outcomes of 5 engineering courses and Grade Point Average (GPA) in the first semester. To find out the differences in their learning outcomes, a t-test with the help of SPSS software was used. In the component of course scores, 64 students of the Electrical Engineering study program class of 2019 are compared, but in the GPA component with the t-test, 24 students of each type of graduate are taken randomly. From the results of data processing, it is known that SMK graduates only excel in 1 course, while high school graduates excel in 4 courses. Overall, high school graduates get a higher GPA than vocational high school graduates. The t-test results show that Sig <0.05. From these results, it can be concluded that there are differences in the learning outcomes of students from SMA in comparison to those from SMK."
"Engineering local environment of ruthenium by defect-tuned SnO2 over carbon cloth for neutral-media N2 electroreduction Nitrogen Fixation; Ammonia; Electrosynthesis Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is of great potential as a sustainable and alternative technique to the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process for NH3 production. However, its practical applications are impeded by the low NH3 yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE) mainly due to the inert Nâ‰¡N triple bond and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, ruthenium-doped defect-rich SnO2 nanoparticles on carbon cloth (Ruâ€“SnO2/CC) are synthesized for efficient electrocatalytic NRR under ambient conditions. The catalysts exhibit an NH3 yield of 4.83 Î¼g hâˆ’1 cmâˆ’2 with a FE of 17.01% at âˆ’0.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 M Na2SO4. The integration of Ru species, SnO2 and oxygen vacancies leads a synergistic catalytic system, in which the semiconducting SnO2 particles not only stabilize the Ru active centers but also suppress the HER, while the oxygen vacancies in SnO2 lattice help to promote the N2 adsorption and enhance the activity of the Ru active centers. Overall, this synergy result in a unique local environment around the Ru active sites that favors the NRR process, which is further reinforced by the binder-free and facile electron transfer nature of CC, leading to the outstanding NRR catalytic activity and durability. These results outperform majority of the noble-metals-based electrocatalysts under similar conditions. This metal-doping tuned local environment manipulation may open up a promising avenue to the design and fabrication of efficient catalysts for N2 electroreduction."

"High selectivity color filters based on bismuth enhanced plasmonic nanorods Color Printing; Metals; Counterfeiting In view of the low intensity of surface plasmon resonance in nanorod-array based color filters, we propose a Bi-SiO2-Ag nanorod array color filter, which takes advantage of the perfect absorption of the incident light by bismuth and the enhancement effect of metalâ€“insulatorâ€“metal (MIM) cavity on localized surface plasmon resonance. By changing the thickness of silicon dioxide in the middle layer to adjust the resonance wavelength and using the COMSOL Multiphysics software to study and verify, we show that the proposed device can achieve filtering effect in the visible and near-infrared spectrum range, leading to up to 95% reflectivity in a specific wavelength range. In addition, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the device is considerably lower than that of traditional metallic materials, significantly reducing color crosstalk. Therefore, it can be used as a reflective color filter. The proposed structure has many potential applications in the fields of photoelectric detection, image sensing and display."

"Expert systems and the prospects of artificial intelligence for the automatic supervisory control of salinity gradient solar ponds Solar Ponds; Salinity; Exergy Salt Gradient Solar Ponds (SGSPs) are conventionally operated wholly manually. They hence suffer from a loss of efficiency for substantial durations when disturbed by natural diffusion and environmental elements such as temperature variation, solar radiation, and wind. They also impose considerable operational costs and time when a repair is unavoidable. Here, a Zero-Discharge Closed Cycle (ZDClC) is proposed for sustainable implementation of control architectures. We then define the SGSP as a control system and propose an automatic approach that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to mimic expertsâ€™ actions during repair operations. More specifically, an Automatic Supervisory Controller (ASC-SGSP) is proposed that decomposes the pond into several uniform sublayers according to their thicknesses and salt concentrations. The automated supervisor then uses a decision tree analysis of pond stability to determine the sequences of injection/suction actions to guarantee the pond stability and prevent layer overturning. An onâ€“off subcontroller then directs the chosen sublayer's salt density to its desired value. The supervisory structure is general and can operate with either the proposed open-loop or closed-loop configurations. Results indicate the potential utility of AI and expert systems as a successful paradigm for SGSP control. Specifically, the proposed approach is examined in a simulated pond under several scenarios challenging its efficiency, adaptivity, robustness, and constraint handling properties. The ASC-SGSP fulfills the automatic control requirements during either open/closed-loop configurations and regulates the desired salinity levels under parameter constraints and uncertainties, even when the SGSP parameters are perturbed by as much as 50%."

"Leveraging smart contract in project procurement through dlt to gain sustainable competitive advantages Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things Project delivery on time, with agreed quality and assigned budget, is the desire of project-based companies. Time, quality, and cost are determinants of project success; however, organisations suffer from achieving these three success criteria at the same time. Failures in project delivery cause the loss of the competitive advantage. The recent digital technologies introduce smart contracts to supply chain (SC) operations for improving SC processes. Project procurement is the area for smart contract implementation to deliver successful projects and gain sustainable competitive advantages. The aim of this study was in explaining how smart contracts benefit project organisations through project procurement. Qualitative research design guided this research with phenomenology. Semi-structured interviews generated the data. The obtained research data were analysed with thematic, textual, and discourse analysis. Published industry reports were used to triangulate the data. This study demonstrated an integrated relationship model to answer the research question. The research findings initially identified the fact that smart contracts improve procurement efficiency through cost, time, and quality. Secondly, smart contracts build a trust-less platform where reliability is delivered and reinforced with transparency, traceability, and security. This study found that enhanced procurement efficiency and reliability meet requirements to gain sustainable competitive advantages. This study intends to contribute to industry practices and future research. The correlation of project procurement management success, smart contracts, and sustainable competitive advantages are expected to guide feature research and business practices."

"Pregnancy and homelessness: Women?s perspectives on
early intervention and a cross-sector forum The proposed research project aims to build evidence to inform service delivery and policy development to meet the needs of pregnant women experiencing homelessness. This project builds on previous research (Murray, Theobald & Watson, 2018) which, while noting elements of good practice, identified several key issues concerning pregnant homeless women in relation to data collection, staff training, integration of services, and the provision of specialist support and all forms of accommodation, including crisis, transitional and long term housing. This earlier research (Stage 1) involved interviews with 41 staff from 27 homelessness, health and other agencies and produced a report with 24 policy and practice recommendations. This second stage of the research, informed by the earlier stage of the research, will investigate the experiences and perspectives of pregnant, homeless women and produce a report with policy and practice recommendations. The findings, in conjunction with the findings of Stage 1, will provide the foundation for a cross-sector forum. The cross-sector forum will identify a strategy to inform policy and improve service delivery for pregnant homeless women."

"The state of wildfire and bushfire science: Temporal trends, research divisions and knowledge gaps Fuel Treatment; Climate Change; Fire Severity Along with the increase in the frequency of disastrous wildfires and bushfires around the world during the recent decades, scholarly research efforts have also intensified in this domain. This work investigates divisions and trends of the domain of wildfire/bushfire research. Results show that this research domain has been growing exponentially. It is estimated that the field, as of 2021, it has grown to larger than 13,000 research items, with an excess of 1,200 new articles appearing every year. It also exhibits distinct characteristics of a multidisciplinary research domain. Analyses of the underlying studies reveal that the field is made up of five major divisions. These divisions embody research activities around (i) forest ecology and climate, (ii) fire detection and mapping technologies, (iii) community risk mitigation and planning, (iv) soil and water ecology, and (v) atmospheric science. Research into the sub-topics of reciprocal effects between climate change and fire activities, fire risk modelling/mapping (including burned area modelling), wildfire impact on organic matter, biomass burning, and human health impacts currently constitute trending areas of this field. Amongst these, the climate cluster showed an explosion of activities in 2020 while the human health cluster is identified as the most recent emerging topic of this domain. On the other hand, dimensions of wildfire research related to human behaviourâ€”particularly issues of emergency training, risk perception and wildfire hazard educationâ€”seem to be notably underdeveloped in this field, making this one of its most apparent knowledge gaps. A scoping review of all reviews and meta-analysis of this field demonstrates that this sub-topic is also virtually non-existent on the research synthesis front. This meta-synthesis further reveals how a western, deductive view excludes socioecological and traditional knowledge of fire."

"Solar Panels and Geotechnical Soil Slopes Integration Solar technology can be readily applied to the integration of solar panels with geotechnical slopes, such as slopes, embankments of traffic roads. The integration of solar panels on geotechnical slopes will have many advantages and benefits, such as increasing slope stability, reducing construction and maintenance costs, as well as producing clean electric power. 
While in most of solar power implementations, the solar panels are installed on roof tops, the installation of solar panels on geotechnical slopes or traffic embankment has additional benefits as a part of sustainable technology implementation.
This research project aims at investigating solar panels and geotechnical structure integration on Victoria railway and road embankments. The recent advancement in solar technology has made it economically viable to generate clean energy electricity on our public space such as embank slopes. Geotechnical benefit of installing solar panels to existing slopes/embankments includes reduction in rainwater infiltration into soil soils. Study has shown that 95% of slope instability were triggered by rainwater. Solar panels installed on slopes will reduce rainwater infiltration into the soils, so to protect the slope stability, and reduce maintenance costs. This concept can also be adopted in a new slope design using solar panels as an integrated component in a slope system.

"QDaS: Quality driven data summarisation for effective storage management in Internet of Things Incentive Mechanism; Individual Rationality; Internet Of Things The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the emergence of enabling many interesting applications within the realm of several domains including smart cities. However, the accumulation of data from smart IoT devices poses significant challenges for data storage while there are needs to deliver relevant and high quality services to consumers. In this paper, we propose QDaS, a novel domain agnostic framework as a solution for effective data storage and management of IoT applications. The framework incorporates a novel data summarisation mechanism that uses an innovative data quality estimation technique. This proposed data quality estimation technique computes the quality of data (based on their utility) without requiring any feedback from users of this IoT data or domain awareness of the data. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed QDaS framework using real world datasets."
"Optimal Solar Plant Site Identification Using GIS and Remote Sensing: Framework and Case Study Solar Farms; Solar Power Plants; Global Positioning System Many countries have set a goal for a carbon neutral future, and the adoption of solar energy as an alternative energy source to fossil fuel is one of the major measures planned. Yet not all locations are equally suitable for solar energy generation. This is due to uneven solar radiation distribution as well as various environmental factors. A number of studies in the literature have used multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to determine the most suitable places to build solar power plants. To the best of our knowledge, no study has addressed the subject of optimal solar plant site identification for the Al-Qassim region, although developing renewable energy in Saudi Arabia has been put on the agenda. This paper developed a spatial MCDA framework catering to the characteristics of the Al-Qassim region. The framework adopts several tools used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), such as Random Forest (RF) raster classification and model builder. The framework aims to ascertain the ideal sites for solar power plants in the Al-Qassim region in terms of the amount of potential photovoltaic electricity production (PVOUT) that could be produced from solar energy. For that, a combination of GIS and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques were employed to determine five sub-criteria weights (Slope, Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), proximity to roads, proximity to residential areas, proximity to powerlines) before perform-ing spatial MCDA. The result showed that â€˜the most suitableâ€™ and â€˜suitableâ€™ areas for the establish-ment of solar plants are in the south and southwest of the region, representing about 17.53% of the study area. The â€˜unsuitableâ€™ areas account for about 10.17% of the total study area, which is mainly concentrated in the northern part. The rest of the region is further classified into â€˜moderateâ€™ and â€˜restrictedâ€™ areas, which account for 46.42% and 25.88%, respectively. The most suitable area for potential solar energy, yields approximately 1905 Kwh/Kwp in terms of PVOUT. The proposed framework also has the potential to be applied to other regions nationally and internationally. This work contributes a reproducible GIS workflow for a low-cost but accurate adoption of a solar energy plan to achieve sustainable development goals."

"The evolution of stakeholder management practices in Australian mega construction projects Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management Purpose: The complicated nature of megaprojects requires appropriate analysis of multiple stakeholders to achieve project objectives and to accommodate stakeholder interests. During the last two decades, many stakeholder theories and empirical studies have sprouted. Although previous studies have contributed to the development of stakeholder theory, it seems that these theoretical advances have not been fully adopted and acknowledged in practices, especially in megaprojects. The purpose of this paper is to explore the evolution of stakeholder analysis and engagement practices adopted in the Australian megaprojects over the last two decades. Design/methodology/approach: Four mega construction projects are described and analysed in this study. Secondary data were first assembled in order to get general knowledge of each case. Interviews were conducted with the project directors. Project documents were collected from the project teams and reviewed. Wherever the project information was unclear, e-mails were sent to the directors and the team members to confirm the details. Findings: Project teams have started to apply snowball rolling and stakeholder attribute assessment methods to analyse stakeholders. However, there is still a way to adopt the â€œnetworkâ€ analysis perspective because the project teams are reluctant to use complicated tools which need specialistsâ€™ assistance. The stakeholder engagement practices have evolved to an extent where the project teams monitor the dynamics of stakeholdersâ€™ requirements. Projects teams have identified the importance of continuity to manage stakeholders in these massive projects. However, a structured method selection mechanism for stakeholder engagement has not been developed. Originality/value: This study will help academics to understand the adoption progress and status of stakeholder management methods."

"Online activism and redress for institutional child abuse: function and rhetoric in survivor advocacy group tweets Social Media; Organization-public Relationships; Strategic Communication In Australia, survivor advocacy groups have been closely engaged with the emergence and development of policy and redress responses to institutional child abuse. Their activities and influence in this respect have been under-researched. This study focuses on the use of Twitter, a tool increasingly employed by activist groups in their lobbying repertoires. Using content and thematic analysis, tweets of 15 non-survivor led advocacy groups, and one survivor-led organisationâ€”Care Leavers Australasia Network (CLAN)â€”referring to â€˜redressâ€™ were analysed for rhetorical content (via Aristotleâ€™s traditional framework of ethos, pathos, and logos) and communication purposes using three broad functional areas defined by Lovejoy and Saxton (2012). In keeping with Lovejoy and Saxtonâ€™s (2012) framework, the results found that for both non-survivor led advocacy groups and CLAN the primary function of their use of Twitter was to convey information to audiences. However, the integrated use of the rhetoric framework with the function framework revealed markedly different lobbying styles between the non-survivor led advocacy groups and CLAN with the latter pursuing a more confrontational and direct style of lobbying in communications. CLAN also overwhelmingly pursued emotion-focussed rhetoric in lobbying communications."

"Assessment of red tide risk by integrating CRITIC weight method, TOPSIS-ASSETS method, and Monte Carlo simulation Rainstorms; Disaster; Projection Pursuit This study proposes a red tide risk assessment method based on intercriteria correlation (CRITIC), technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS), assessment of estuarine trophic status (ASSETS) methods and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to calculate the probability of each risk level. The integrated TOPSIS-ASSETS method is used to calculate the risk levels of each year, where index weight is determined by CRITIC method. MCS method is employed to calculate the probability of each risk level. The results showed that level III to level V indicates high possibility of red tides in the case study area (Tolo Harbor). The highest risk rating was level V in 1988. The change of the risk level of red tide is consistent with the real situation of the occurrence of red tide. Another case of the east part of Skagerrak Strait shows that the results of this method are consistent with field situation. When there is an error between the evaluation results and the real situation, MCS can further suggest the probability of error in the evaluation results. Meanwhile, sensitivity analysis was used to test the performance of the evaluation model and two comparative methods. The results show that the proposed risk assessment method has better performance than other methods and can provide an effective risk evaluation for red tide management."

These trends in practice create complex tensions and ethical dilemmas for SPs. UNICEF (2017) argue that all children with disabilities should be educated in mainstream settings and recommend that specialist education provision ends. Indeed, challenging behaviour is often the primary reason given to justify why children with disabilities are placed at a special school rather than their local mainstream school. A mapping literature review of research literature published 2009â€“2019 was undertaken to investigate this issueâ€”namely, the type of specialist behavioural interventions delivered in specialist settings by SPsâ€”and illuminate any tensions or ethical dilemmas arising. Contrary to expectations, literature reviewed was unclear whether SPs are increasingly involved in specialist settings delivering evidence-based behavioural interventions. Articles surveyed tended to explore the use of evidence-based behavioural interventions in mainstream settings to de-escalating challenging behaviours, reducing the risk that students with disabilities are referred out of mainstream into specialist provision. Several studies captured by this review critically questioned whether evidence-based behavioural interventions were suitable for use in educational settings of any type with students with a disability. Directions for future research are given, specifically: research should illuminate precisely what, if any, involvement SPs have in delivering behavioural interventions to students with disabilities in special schools, behaviour units and clinics, including greater discussion about any associated benefits or ethical risks."

"Porous Silicon Nanocarriers with Stimulus-Cleavable Linkers for Effective Cancer Therapy Drug Delivery Systems; Theranostic Nanomedicine; Hydrosilylation Porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNPs) are widely utilized as drug carriers due to their excellent biocompatibility, large surface area, and versatile surface chemistry. However, the dispersion in pore size and biodegradability of pSiNPs arguably have hindered the application of pSiNPs for controlled drug release. Here, a step-changing solution to this problem is described involving the design, synthesis, and application of three different linker-drug conjugates comprising anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) and different stimulus-cleavable linkers (SCLs) including the photocleavable linker (ortho-nitrobenzyl), pH-cleavable linker (hydrazone), and enzyme-cleavable linker (Î²-glucuronide). These SCL-DOX conjugates are covalently attached to the surface of pSiNP via copper (I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC, i.e., click reaction) to afford pSiNP-SCL-DOXs. The mass loading of the covalent conjugation approach for pSiNP-SCL-DOX reaches over 250 Âµg of DOX per mg of pSiNPs, which is notably twice the mass loading achieved by noncovalent loading. Moreover, the covalent conjugation between SCL-DOX and pSiNPs endows the pSiNPs with excellent stability and highly controlled release behavior. When tested in both in vitro and in vivo tumor models, the pSiNP-SCL-DOXs induces excellent tumor growth inhibition."

"Electrochemical hydrogen storage in porous carbons with acidic electrolytes: Uncovering the potential Hydrogen Storage; United States Department of Energy; Graphite Electrochemical hydrogen storage in porous carbon materials is emerging as a cost-effective hydrogen storage and transport technology with competitive power and energy densities. The merits of electrochemical hydrogen storage using porous conductive carbon-based electrodes are reviewed. The employment of acidic electrolytes in such storage systems is compared with alkaline electrolytes. The recent innovations of a proton battery for smaller-scale electricity storage, and a proton flow reactor system for larger (grid)-scale storage and bulk export of hydrogen produced from renewable energy, are briefly described. It is argued that such systems, along with variants proposed by others, all of which rely on electrochemical hydrogen storage in porous carbons, can contribute to the search for energy storage technologies essential for the transition to a zero-emission global economy."

"Nanostructures and their application for enhancing photocatalytic activity of CO2- AINSE post graduate award (applicant PhD student: Ms Jiajia Zhao) Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is a renewable reaction to convert CO2 into chemical fuels. Semiconductors are commonly used as photocatalysts, however poor selectivity and low-efficient light absorption still restrict large-scale production. Therefore, it is critical to control the structure properties of photocatalysts and investigate reaction mechanisms for improving product selectivity. This project aims to develop novel SnO2-based nanostructures and mixed-metal oxides for improved photocatalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation. A library of catalysts will be synthesised and characterized by using high-throughput methods. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction will be used to analyse crystal structures, and neutron diffraction will be used to determine oxygen defect concentration."

"Comparative root transcriptomics provide insights into drought adaptation strategies in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) Cicer; Ascochyta; Genetic Variability Drought adversely affects crop production across the globe. The root system immensely contributes to water management and the adaptability of plants to drought stress. In this study, drought-induced phenotypic and transcriptomic responses of two contrasting chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) genotypes were compared at the vegetative, reproductive transition, and reproductive stages. At the vegetative stage, drought-tolerant genotype maintained higher root biomass, length, and surface area under drought stress as compared to sensitive genotype. However, at the reproductive stage, root length and surface area of tolerant genotype was lower but displayed higher root diameter than sensitive genotype. The shoot biomass of tolerant genotype was overall higher than the sensitive genotype under drought stress. RNA-seq analysis identified genotype-and developmental-stage specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to drought stress. At the vegetative stage, a total of 2161 and 1873 DEGs, and at reproductive stage 4109 and 3772 DEGs, were identified in the tolerant and sensitive genotypes, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed enrichment of biological categories related to cellular process, metabolic process, response to stimulus, response to abiotic stress, and response to hormones. Interestingly, the expression of stress-responsive transcription factors, kinases, ROS signaling and scavenging, transporters, root nodulation, and oxylipin biosynthesis genes were robustly upregulated in the tolerant genotype, possibly contributing to drought adaptation. Furthermore, activation/repression of hormone signaling and biosynthesis genes was observed. Overall, this study sheds new insights on drought tolerance mechanisms operating in roots with broader implications for chickpea improvement."

"Midkine treatment for multi-organ protection from hypoxia and inflammation in neonates (PG08917) The GOAL of this program is to develop a safe and easily administered therapy for infants that have experienced oxygen and nutrient starvation during gestation and at birth. We propose that treatment with the growth factor MIDKINE has the potential to address
complications of birth asphyxia, principally neonatal encephalopathy (NE) and associated multi-organ dysfunction involving respiratory, cardiovascular, renal and digestive systems. In this project, we will determine the most effective and clinically relevant way to deliver
midkine to neonatal animals (systemic vs intranasal routes), and investigate if midkine treatment at various times after birth improves the health of infants that would otherwise suffer multi-organ damage and cerebral palsy. The results of this study will be readily transferable to a clinical trial of midkine in infants - in both high-income settings where therapeutic hypothermia is available, and in low resource settings where such interventions are not available!

"High-performance work systems and job performance: the mediating role of social identity, social climate and empowerment in Chinese banks High Performance Work Systems; Personnel; HR Practice Purpose: Despite the utility of social identity and social climate theories in explaining individual and group behaviour within organizations, little research has been conducted on how these approaches interconnect to explain the way high-performance work systems (HPWSs) may increase job performance. This study extends oneâ€™s understanding of the human resource management (HRM)â€“performance relationship by examining the interconnections between these disparate social approaches within the Chinese banking context. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a sample of 561 employees working across 62 bank branches in China, the authors test four hypotheses: (1) HPWS is positively related to social climate; (2) social climate mediates the relationship between HPWS and social identification; (3) psychological empowerment mediates the relationship between social identification and job performance; and (4) social climate, social identification and psychological empowerment sequentially mediate the relationship between HPWS and job performance. Data were collected over two waves and job (in-role) performance was rated by managers. Findings: The authors confirm the four hypotheses. Social climate, social identification and psychological empowerment sequentially mediate the relationship between HPWS and job performance. Research limitations/implications: This study contains some limitations. First, the authorsâ€™ research sites were focussed on one main region in state-owned banks in China. Second, this study examined only one industry with a relatively homogeneous workforce (i.e. relatively young and highly educated employees). Practical implications: HPWS may translate into individual performance through a supportive social climate in which staff identify themselves with their work team. This suggests that organizations should pay close attention to understanding how their HPWS system can foster a strong social climate to enhance employee identification at the work group level. Second, as the nature of work is becoming increasingly more complex and interdependent, enabling not just individuals but also work groups to function effectively, it is critical for departments and work groups to promote a collective understanding of HRM messages with shared values and goals. Originality/value: This research contributes towards a more comprehensive understanding of the HRMâ€“performance chain as a complex social process underpinned by social identity theory. The authors demonstrate that social identification and social climate both play an important role in explaining how HPWS positively affects psychological empowerment and subsequent job performance."
"A comparative study of biological activated carbon based treatments on two different types of municipal reverse osmosis concentrates Ozonation; Micropollutant; Effluent A study was conducted to understand the impact of reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) characteristics on the efficacy of biological activated carbon (BAC) based treatments for removing organics and nutrients from two ROC streams (ROCa derived from municipal waste input with high salinity, and ROCb derived from domestic waste plus industrial trade waste with markedly lower salinity). Fluorescence excitation and emission matrix spectra and molecular weight analysis demonstrated that ROCa and ROCb had a significantly different composition of organic compounds due to the petrochemical processing and abattoir waste compounds in ROCb. Although the sequence of coagulation, UV/H2O2 and BAC gave the highest organic removal from the two ROCs (67% DOC for ROCa and 62% for ROCb), UV/H2O2 followed by BAC achieved satisfactory removal (>55%) for both ROC types. Sequential treatment involving coagulation gave better phosphorus removal (>90%) than any single treatment (<65%). Total nitrogen (TN) removal was fairly low (<50%) for all the treatment options and the salinity level had insignificant impact on nitrogen removal. Analysis of bacterial communities suggested that higher phosphorus removal and lower total nitrogen and nitrate removal from ROCb than ROCa was related to the presence of various denitrifying or phosphorus accumulating bacteria in the BAC."

"Remediation of PBDEs-metal co-contaminated soil by the combination of metal stabilization, persulfate oxidation and bioremediation Activation; Sulfate Radical; Advanced Oxidation Laboratory experiments were performed to investigate the efficiency of a simultaneous metal stabilization, persulfate oxidation and bioremediation for decontaminating polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and toxic metals from an actual soil polluted by the recycling activity of electronic waste. Biochar and bentonite were applied to the soil for immobilizing heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn and Ni). It was found that the toxicity level declined most significantly in the case of 20 g/kg biochar +20 g/kg bentonite. A low dose of persulfate (20 mmol/kg soil) was found to be suitable for oxidizing soil PBDEs and enhancing the bioavailability of PBDEs residue. Persulfate oxidation reduced the soil organic matter content, and caused dramatic decrease of bacterial density. Nevertheless, microbial activity and number recovered on the whole during 90 days of bioremediation. Finally, a degradation efficiency of 94.6% and a mineralization efficiency of 60.3% were obtained by the hybrid treatment scheme. The pyrosequencing analysis indicates that soil bacterial community changed obviously during the treatments, and there was an enrichment of PBDE-degrading populations during bioremediation relative to that of oxidized soil."

"On the Feasibility of Machine Learning Models for Customer Spending Prediction Problem Customer Churn; Sales; Customer Relationship Management Over the last few years, FinTech (Financial Technology) companies have played a significant role in supporting e-commerce processes and transactions. For individual users, more convenient payment methods were invented to help them purchase more easily. For businesses, itâ€™s now a lot easier to understand customers than ever, especially in knowing how they spend their money. In fact, the capability of predicting customer spending power over a period of time is a crucial task for marketers in making strategic decisions about advertising. However, it is not trivial to build such an automatic prediction system due to the numerous models and metrics available combined with the ad-hoc nature of personal purchases. In this paper, as the first step in tackling the above-mentioned problem, we explored the feasibility of applying different machine learning models and metrics to predict customer spending under different contexts. In particular, we applied Beta Geometric/Negative Binomial distribution (BG/NBD), Gamma-gamma, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to train and predict customer spending. Experimenting with anonymized real-world data supplied by one of the biggest payment providers in Vietnam provided us with valuable insights into the suitability of each model. The result of this research can serve as a foundation for more in-depth work on the same problem in the future."

"Public satisfaction with urban trees and their management in Australia: The roles of values, beliefs, knowledge, and trust Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure The success of urban forest management strategies is dependent on public support for and engagement with urban trees. Satisfaction with urban trees and their management, and the level of trust people have in urban tree managers, are useful for understanding public opinions. Yet these concepts, and the mechanisms leading to the formation of public opinions remain poorly explored in the literature. Here we explore how satisfaction with urban trees and with urban tree management, and trust in the agencies responsible for urban tree management, are explained by cognitive factors (values, beliefs, and knowledge) and socio-ecological contextual factors (tree presence/canopy cover, cultural diversity, and socioeconomic status) using an online survey of 16 local government areas in south-eastern Australia. Analyses of 2367 responses revealed that people's opinions about trees in general (values and beliefs) were overwhelmingly positive, while their opinions about more contextualised measures such as satisfaction and trust were more mixed. Two distinct pathways that influence satisfaction were identified: one linked to beliefs about having trees in cities, and another one linked to trust in urban tree management. At the local government level, satisfaction was negatively associated with a measure of cultural diversity and very low levels of tree canopy cover, but not with socioeconomic disadvantage. Satisfaction with local trees could be improved by increasing the quality of ecological function of trees, such as habitat provision and tree diversity. Community engagement could also improve satisfaction and trust, particularly perceived procedural fairness of decision-making, reinforce positive beliefs about the outcomes of having trees in cities, and dispel negative beliefs. Engagement processes should recognise that people hold complex and diverse opinions about urban trees, and by incorporating these opinions into decision-making we can meet the increasingly complex and diverse expectations being placed on urban forests."
"Blockchain technology implementation challenges in supply chains – evidence from the case studies of multi-stakeholders Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things Purpose: The aim of the research is to identify and prioritise the implementation challenges of blockchain technology and suggests ways for its implementation in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: Underlined by the technology, organisational, and external environment model, a conceptual framework with four challenge categories and sixteen challenges is proposed. Data collected from three stakeholder groups with experience in the implementation of blockchain technology in India is analysed by employing an analytical hierarchy process method-based case study. Further, a criticalityâ€“effort matrix analysis is performed to group challenges and suggest ways for implementation. Findings: The analysis revels that all stakeholders perceive complexity challenge associated with the technology, organisational structure, and external environment, and issues of compatibility with existing systems, software, and business practices to be high on the criticality and effort scales, which thus require meticulous planning to manage. Likewise, top-management support issues related to insufficient understanding of how technology fits with the organisationâ€™s policy and benefits offered by the technology requires high effort to address this challenge. Research limitations/implications: The results were obtained by focusing on the Indian context and therefore may not apply to other nationsâ€™ contexts. Practical implications: By investigating the challenges that the developers, consultants, and client organisations need to address, this study assists managers in developing plans to facilitate coordination among these organisations for successful blockchain implementation. Originality/value: To the authorsâ€™ knowledge this study is the first to identify and prioritise the challenges from the perspectives of multiple stakeholder groups with experience in blockchain technology implementation."

"Entrepreneurial Motivations, Opportunities, and Challenges: An International Perspective Entrepreneurial Intention; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship The current entrepreneurship research has primarily focused on external environmental factors that influence enterprise development in developed economies, whilst studies from developing economies are lagging. Yet, evidence from the World Bank and Global Entrepreneurship Index suggest that entrepreneurship practice in developing economies has peaked. Using semi-structured interview data from 20 entrepreneurs in The Gambia, we examined their motivations for entrepreneurship, the market opportunities and challenges hindering enterprise growth. We found the factors influencing motivation to be individual (necessity, poverty, job creation, personal knowledge, and experience) and contextual (opportunity recognition, ethnic and religious norms). Interestingly, three forms of opportunities were identified: entrepreneurial networks, competitive market, and discovery. Nonetheless, the entrepreneurs faced individual challengesâ€“insufficient finance and unskilled staffâ€“and contextual limitations such as political change, limited government reforms, high taxes, high business cost, and market uncertainty. We offer critical insights into individual and contextual motivations for entrepreneurship, extending the current discourse. In addition, we expose specific dynamic market influences for enterprise development in a developing economy."

"Quantification of long-term accumulation of inhaled ultrafine particles via human olfactory-brain pathway due to environmental emissions – a pilot study Pollution Exposure; Air Quality; Alzheimer Disease Olfactory pathway as a viable route for brain uptake of environmental pollutants has been hypothesized in past decade. In such a hypothesis, subclinical low-dose exposure and chronic brain accumulation of exogenous airborne agents are critical to define neurodegenerations, however the information is extremely lacking. Advances in granular measurement of air pollutants, real-time personal exposure monitoring and big data analytics have opened-up an unprecedented opportunity to enable researchers conduct longitudinal investigation and potentially link the external environment condition to risks of human developing neurodegenerative diseases in a foreseeable future. Detailed case studies are provided in this work that illustrate the quantification of human brain accumulation of ultrafine particles (UFPs) from exposure, surface deposition, and pathway penetration via the transport route of nasal olfactory in prolonged timespans. The study links the individual components along the olfactory pathway, showcases the available research capacity, and pinpoints the critical areas of research need in environmental, toxicological and epidemiological studies, significant to a joint effort to bring together an interdisciplinary solution to uncover the insight of time course and dose dependency between environmental exposure and risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases in a foreseeable future. It should be noted that current study assumes that nanoparticle penetration along the olfactory pathway is unidirectional and follows the rate observed in the rodent study. Tissue responses in determining the penetration and retention corresponding to size and composition of the inhaled nanoparticles are not considered."

"Conformationally tuned antibacterial oligomers target the peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria Guanidines; Antiinfective Agent; Ammonium Salts The recent rise of antibiotic resistance amongst Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) populations has made treating Staph-based infections a global medical challenge. Therapies that specifically target the peptidoglycan layer of S. aureus have emerged as new treatment avenues, towards which bacteria are less likely to develop resistance. While the majority of antibacterial polymers/oligomers have the ability to disrupt bacterial membranes, the design parameters for the enhanced disruption of peptidoglycan outer layer of Gram-positive bacteria remain unclear. Here, the design of oligomeric structures with favorable conformational characteristics for improved disruption of the peptidoglycan outer layer of Gram-positive bacteria is reported. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to inform the structure design and composition of cationic oligomers displaying collapsed and expanded conformations. The most promising diblock and triblock cationic oligomers were synthesized by photo-induced atom transfer radical polymerization (photo ATRP). Following synthesis, the diblock and triblock oligomers displayed average antibacterial activity of ~99% and ~98% for S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), respectively, at the highest concentrations tested. Importantly, triblock oligomers with extended conformations showed significantly higher disruption of the peptidoglycan outer layer of S. aureus compared to diblock oligomers with more collapsed conformation, as evidenced by a number of characterization techniques including scanning electron, confocal and atomic force microscopy. This work provides new insight into the structure/property relationship of antibacterial materials and advances the design of functional materials for combating the rise of drug-resistant bacteria."

"Cinnamide derived pyrimidine-benzimidazole hybrids as tubulin inhibitors: Synthesis, in silico and cell growth inhibition studies Antineoplastic Activity; Tubulin Modulators; Combretastatin An approach in modern medicinal chemistry to discover novel bioactive compounds is by mimicking diverse complementary pharmacophores. In extension of this strategy, a new class of piperazine-linked cinnamide derivatives of benzimidazole-pyrimidine hybrids have been designed and synthesized. Their in vitro cytotoxicity profiles were explored on selected human cancer cell lines. Specifically, structural comparison of target hybrids with tubulin-DAMA-colchicine and tubulin-nocodazole complexes has exposed a deep position of benzimidazole ring into the Î±T5 loop. All the synthesized compounds were demonstrated modest to interesting cytotoxicity against different cancer cell lines. The utmost cytotoxicity has shown with an amine linker of benzimidazole-pyrimidine series, with specificity toward A549 (lung cancer) cell line. The most potent compound in this series was 18i, which inhibited cancer cell growth at micromolar concentrations ranging 2.21â€“7.29 ÂµM. Flow cytometry studies disclosed that 18i inhibited the cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle. The potent antitumor activity of 18i resulted from enhanced microtubule disruption at a similar level as nocodazole on Î²-tubulin antibody, explored using immunofluorescence staining. The most active compound 18i also inhibited tubulin polymerization with an IC50 of 5.72 Â± 0.51 ÂµM. In vitro biological analysis of 18i presented apoptosis induction on A549 cells with triggering of ROS generation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in DNA injury. In addition, 18i displayed impairment in cellular migration and inhibited the colony formation. Notably, the safety profile of most potent compound 18i was revealed by screening against normal human pulmonary epithelial cells (L132: IC50: 69.25 Â± 5.95 Î¼M). The detailed binding interactions of 18i with tubulin was investigated by employing molecular docking, superimposition and free energy analyses. Thus remarks made in this study established that pyrimidine-benzimidazole hybrids as a new class of tubulin polymerization inhibitors with significant anticancer activity."
"Mandatory corporate social responsibility in India: reporting reality, issues and way forward Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: Since 2013, the Indian Companies Act Section 135 has mandated corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting by Indian central public sector enterprises (CPSEs). CSR reporting is regulated by multiple Government of India ministerial agencies, each requiring different formats and often different data. This study aims to understand the impact of these multiple regulatory bodies on CSR reporting by Indian CPSEs; evaluate the expectation gap between regulators and the regulated; and investigate the compliance burden on CPSEs. Design/methodology/approach: An interview-based approach was adopted to evaluate the perspectives of both regulators and regulated CPSEs on the impact of the new regulations on CSR reporting quality. The authors use the lens of institutional theory to analyse the findings. Findings: Driven by coercive institutional pressures, CPSEs are overburdened with myriad reporting requirements, which significantly negatively impact CPSEsâ€™ financial and human resources and the quality of CSR activity and reports. It is difficult for CPSEs to assess the actual impact of their CSR activities due to overlapping with activities of the government/other institutions. The perceptions of regulators and the regulated are divergent: the regulators expect CPSEs to select more impactful CSR projects to comply with mandatory reporting requirements. Originality/value: The findings of this study emphasise the need for meaningful dialogue between regulators and the regulated to reduce the expectation gap and establish a single regulatory authority that will ensure that the letter and spirit of the law are followed in practice and not just according to a tick-box approach."
"Life cycle assessment of rainwater harvesting system components – To determine environmentally sustainable design Rainwater; Harvesting; Water Saving There is a common perception that rainwater harvesting (RWH) is an environmentally sustainable water supply option. This perception is not always precise for all arrangements of the RWH system and components. Thus, all potential features of RWH need to be thoroughly studied to verify its environmental impacts. Broadly, on a household-scale RWH, there are two LCA aspects available in the literature, which can be identified as selecting tank material on the one hand and saving potable water on the other hand. Most of these studies used HDPE as tank material and its fabrication, transportation, installation, and disposal. However, the effects of yearly runoff and pollutant load reductions in net environmental impact assessments were not included in those studies. In this study, catchment-scale net environmental impacts of RWH systems made of different tank materials (e.g. HDPE, LDPE, ferrocement, and steel), components (with pump, no pump, and raised tank bases), tank and roof sizes, and varying annual rainfall patterns (e.g. dry, average and wet years) for various RWH supply reliabilities, were quantified through LCA approach. Results show that the HDPE tank has lesser impacts in most of the impact categories than other tanks. RWH systems with tank sizes of 2000 and 3000 L without pumps, and tank size of 2000 L with a pump under 150 m2 roof, are the most feasible environmental perspectives. The water-saving and pollutant load reductions cannot compensate for the pump operation's impacts, except for very few cases, like 2000 L tank during the driest rain year at lower reliabilities. A tank size larger than 2000 L would not be effective. On average, 70% of the total net life cycle impacts were developed from the operational phase of the RWH (with a pump). The pumping operation provided about 6.5 times higher CO2-eq emission than the water-main. The outlined strategy would help select tank materials, sizes, and RWH accessories based on annual rainfall and roof size available and introduce definite engineering standards, government rebates, and guidelines for RWH. This approach of quantifying the environmental impacts will explain further insights into the RWH system and its components."

"Outrage in Malaysia: The Politics of Taking Offence Malaysia; British Malaya; Islam This article develops a general articulation of the politics of offence and outrage by drawing on examples of high profile political furores in Malaysia. In these furores, minority ethno-religious groups and individuals ostensibly caused offence to the majority Muslim Malay population. Although these offences were framed as transgressions of genuine sensitivities, I argue that politics of offence must be seen for the political utility it holds for those who claim to represent the majority group that has been putatively offended. In Malaysia, a key component of this political strategy is the positioning by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) of its constituencyâ€”the Malaysâ€”as being comparatively economically weaker than non-Malay groups. This positioning in turn warrants the continuation of the positive discrimination policies of the New Economic Policy of the 1970s, which was implemented to achieve parity between the major ethnic groups in Malaysia. An example of this was when UMNO vehemently rejected the findings of a think tank that argued that the New Economic Policyâ€™s target of having 30% Malay ownership of equity had been achieved. This positioning of an in-group as weak, and the normalisation of privilege in the Malaysian context, is analysed in view of two other cases studies, Erving Goffmanâ€™s concept of â€˜the turnâ€™, and Ward Goodenoughâ€™s description of the human experience of outrage. I also show that â€˜outrageâ€™ as a politico-emotional strategy remains effective despite the momentous results of Malaysiaâ€™s general elections in 2018, which might otherwise herald a new era of inter-ethnic co-operation."

"Mussel-inspired synthesis of filter cotton-based AgNPs for oil/water separation, antibacterial and catalytic application Water; Hydrophobicity; Aerogels In this work, we have reported a facile method to fabricate multifunctional three-dimensional filter cotton (3D FC). Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was in situ hydrothermally grown on polydopamine (pDA)-templated filter cotton followed by decoration of 1-Dodecanethiol on the surface for highly efficient oil/water separation, antibacterial and catalytic activity. The morphologies and structural characteristics of functionalized filter cotton were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. It has exhibited good superhydrophobic property with a water contact angle (WCA) of 152.5Â°, and high oil/water separation efficiency. In addition, the 3D filter cotton also be provided with efficient antibacterial properties against E. coli. The catalytic activity of the functionalized filter cotton was evaluated by the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), and it has also performed robust reusability. The multifunctional 3D filter cotton can effectively remove oil and dyes in wastewater, which has promising application prospects in many fields."

"Compressive strength and microstructure evolution of low calcium brown coal fly ash-based geopolymer Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali A comprehensive experimental study has been conducted to investigate the geopolymerisation and compressive strength development of mortar made from brown coal fly ash from two separate locations in the storage ponds of an Australian power plant. The specimens gave similar compressive strengths but had significantly different material and performance characteristics despite being from the same storage location. The Loy Yangâ€’A (LYA) geopolymer mortar demonstrated an approx. 30% strength increase while Loy Yangâ€’B (LYB) gave an approx. 18% strength drop over the period from 7 and 90 d, though both geopolymer mortars initially achieved a similar 28-d strength of approx. 23 MPa. The LYA ash had almost double the alumina content compared to LYB and a higher proportion of AlVI compared to the LYB. The lower alumina content coupled with the low quantity of AlVI in the ash and its lower conversion to AlVI during geopolymerisation is identified as the primary reason for the reduction in strength observed in the LYB geopolymer. The increase of Q4(3Al) during geopolymerisation and some conversion to Q4(4Al) coordination over time resulted in the increase in the compressive strength observed in the LYA mortar. This strength increase of LYA mortar is further correlated with an increase in Quartz phases coupled with a reduction in the Moganite phase. Formation of sodium carbonate due to atmospheric carbonation of unreacted sodium hydroxide in Loy Yang geopolymer additionally contributed to the strength development of LYA geopolymer."

"Estimating unit cost of public university education in Vietnam Firm; Bribes; Anti-corruption Measures This paper is motivated by the ongoing debate on university reform in Vietnam. In particular, there is a need to quantify the level of governmental support for public universities and examine whether or not such a support is adequate. To this end, the present paper estimates training costs per student in different disciplines within the Vietnamese public university education system in 2010. The various estimates of unit costs are based on the definitional approach which defines unit cost as the ratio of total costs over output. In measuring total costs, private costs incurred by university students (apart from formal tuition fees) are excluded. Further, the opportunity cost method employed emphasizes implicit costs such as imputed land rent. The total output is based on weighted student numbers. Unit costs are then estimated using a variety of primary (from survey) and secondary data sources. The results obtained suggest that the unit costs of public university education in Vietnam vary considerably between disciplines. The results also support the presence of economies of scale and scope in higher education and a negative relationship between unit costs and teaching quality proxies. The overall unit cost of public universities in Vietnam is very low in absolute terms when comparing with other countries. However, unit cost relative to GDP per capita in Vietnam is more comparable with those of neighboring countries. Nevertheless, the findings of the paper imply that more resources need to be allocated to the public university sector as part of an urgently needed university reform in Vietnam."

"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and digital inclusion: what is the evidence and where is it? Yolngu; Aboriginal Australians; Anthropology Quantitative research on digital inclusion has grappled with significant gaps in data with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We compare the survey methods and questions of the Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII) data, the National Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Social Survey (NATSISS) and the Census of Population and Housing to identify these gaps. While the ADII is the most comprehensive examination of digital inclusion, encompassing access, affordability, and digital ability measures, the general ADII dataset excludes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in remote areas. In addition, we draw together findings from qualitative research on digital inclusion within particular Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, to demonstrate why digital choicesâ€”including the preference for mobile devicesâ€”are important for understanding statistical trends."

"Trace metal biomonitoring in the east Gippsland Lakes estuary using the barnacle Amphibalanus variegatus and mussel Mytilus edulis Assimilation Efficiency; Bioaccumulation; Cadmium The Gippsland Lakes estuary, a Ramsar listed wetland, in Victoria, Australia, is an area of potential concern for metal pollution due to influxes of human population and associated anthropogenic activities. A biomonitoring exercise was undertaken where the concentrations of 9 metals (Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Ag, Cd and Hg) were analysed in the soft tissue of two common sessile invertebrates: the mussel Mytilus edulis and the barnacle Amphibalanus variegatus from 6 locations on two different occasions throughout the Gippsland Lakes estuary. A salinity gradient exists in the Lakes, from seawater at Lakes Entrance in the east, decreasing down to < 10 PSU in the west at Lake Wellington during times of rainfall, which is a major factor governing the growth and distribution of both species. Dissolved metal levels in general were low; however, Cu at most sites exceeded the 90% trigger values, while all Zn concentrations exceeded the lowest 80% trigger values of the ANZECC marine water quality guidelines for environmental health. Elevated levels of Cu and Zn were found particularly in barnacles at some sites with environmental contamination due to leaching from anti fouling paints and sacrificial zinc anodes. Elevated levels of Ag and Cd were found in mussels at the Hollands Landing site, which is immediately adjacent to a boat ramp, and Cd and Ag at this site are suspected to originate from inland anthropogenic sources. Concentrations of As in M. edulis across all 6 sites in both sampling periods had mean wet weight As concentrations exceeding the maximum level stated in the FSANZ guidelines. A. variegatus contained elevated levels of Hg especially at the North Arm site with a maximum of 13.6 Î¼g Hg/g dry wt., while A. variegatus also showed temporal changes in Hg concentrations across sites. The maximum Hg concentration found in Mytilus edulis was 1.49 Î¼g Hg/g dry wt. at the Hollands Landing site. Previous contaminant studies of biota in the Lakes have targeted sampling of singular predatory or migratory species, such as Black Bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) and the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis). This is the first biomonitoring study conducted on sessile organisms to assess metal contamination in the system."
"Monitoring Victoria’s public forests: implementation of the Victorian Forest Monitoring Program Wildfire; Possums; Tree Cavities A new strategic inventory across all publicly managed forests has been installed in Victoria. For the preceding two decades, Victoriaâ€™s forest inventory has been compiled from various data sources from across the state, an approach that doesnâ€™t allow information about the nature and rate of changes to the resource to be estimated, or for projections or forecasts to be made. To address these limitations, the Victorian Forest Monitoring Program (VFMP) was established, to monitor Victoriaâ€™s progress in meeting a commitment towards sustainable forest management, and to satisfy requirements for state and national reporting. The purpose of the new program is to â€˜assess and monitor the extent, state and sustainable development of Victoriaâ€™s public forests in a timely and accurate manner.â€™ The VFMP consists of a plot-based system of permanent observational units located on a state-wide grid. A combination of ground-based and aerial photo plots and remotely sensed data are used to capture a set of basic attributes that are used to derive indicators of sustainability. To meet the monitoring needs a remeasurement framework has been developed to guide the change estimation procedures. The program was designed and implemented between 2009 and 2015 and used to generate data and information for the most recent Victoriaâ€™s State of the Forest Report. The first annual change estimate is due to be completed in 2017. A summary of implementation and proposed maintenance is presented and discussed in this paper."

"Comparing Australian garment and childcare homeworkers’ experience of regulation and representation ILO; Personnel; Right to Strike Labour markets in Australia have long been segmented by gender and race. This study compares two highly gendered and racially segmented labour markets, home-based family day care workers and garment homeworkers. The comparative cases examine the broader trends of migration, production and consumption that reinforce gender and racial stereotypes, and discourses that underpin representations that women workers are ideally suited to such work. We theorise the gender and racialised inequalities of homework based on the literature on invisibilisation and social reproduction to explore the vulnerable position of migrant women and the consequences of having limited options, such as legal and social protections and any capacity to collectively organise. Our analysis examines the roles and responses of institutions and conceptualises the socio-political factors that affect the characterisation of homework as non-work or as self-employed entrepreneurial activities. By mapping the differing regulatory trajectories of these two groups of homeworkers in terms of regulation and representation, we find both similarities and differences. While garment homeworkers have achieved recognition through legislation and social mobilisation, their circumstances leave them less likely to access such rights. By contrast, the failure to recognise family day care homeworkers, has left them to market forces. JEL code: J01."
"Sustainability leaders in construction industry: A preliminary study Sustainability; Environmental Management Systems; Eco-Management and Audit Scheme With the increasing need of sustainable development globally, many world-leading construction companies have devoted great efforts to implementing sustainable practices. RobecoSAM publishes Sustainability Yearbook annually since 2004, which lists the sustainability leaders in various industries, including construction industry. Learning from those sustainability leaders in construction industry can provide useful references for construction related companies when developing their sustainable development strategies. Based on comprehensive literature review, this paper thus identified 51 methods used for improving sustainability performance and 34 outcomes achieved through these methods. The methods and outcomes are used for coding the sustainable practices of sustainability leaders in construction sector. With the coding system, sustainability reports issued by sustainability leaders in construction sector were analyzed with content analysis. Then, social network analysis was employed to identify the key adopted methods and achieved outcomes (KAMAO) from these leaders. The findings provide valuable guidance for international contractors to have a better understanding of the top sustainable methods adopted by sustainability leaders in construction sector and the top outcomes achieved by these leaders."
"Opportunities for biodiversity conservation as cities adapt to climate change Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Cities are investing billions of dollars in climate change adaptation to combat the effects of sea-level rise, temperature extremes, increasingly intense storm events, flooding and water scarcity. Natural ecosystems have enormous potential to contribute to city resilience, and so, actions that rely on this approach could sustain considerable co-benefits for biodiversity. In this paper we identify the prevalence of key themes of human adaptation response that could have biodiversity conservation outcomes in cities. We then quantify the area of impact for actions that identify specific targets for greening or green infrastructure that could involve natural ecosystems, providing an indicator of potential co-benefits to biodiversity. We then extrapolate to explore the total area of land that could benefit from catchment management approaches, the area of waterways that could benefit from nature-based improvement of these spaces, and finally the number of threatened species that could benefit across these cities. From 80 city climate adaptation plans analysed, we found that urban greening plays a key role in most adaptation strategies, and represents an enormous opportunity for biodiversity conservation, given the diversity of animal and plant species in urban environments. We show that the ranges of at least 270 threatened species overlap with the area covered by just 58 city adaptation plans, including watershed catchments totalling over 28 million km2. However, an analysis of 80 city adaptation plans (of a total 151 found globally) shows that this opportunity is being missed. Just 18% of the plans assessed contained specific intentions to promote biodiversity. We highlight this missed opportunity, as climate adaptation actions undertaken by cities represent an enormous incipient opportunity for nature conservation. Finally, we encourage planners and city governments to incorporate biological conservation into climate adaption plans, for the mutual benefit of urban societies and their biodiversity."
"Adverse shocks, household expenditure and child marriage: evidence from India and Vietnam Early Marriage; Legal Age; Africa South Of The Sahara Child marriage is associated with negative outcomes in regard to education, health and economic empowerment in later life. While the consequences of child marriage have been studied extensively, there has been limited discussion on the drivers of child marriage. This paper examines the impact of adverse shocks on child marriage. We use a sample of 886 girls between 12 and 18 years of age from India and Vietnam involved in the Young Lives project. The potential endogeneity problem is addressed by using rainfall deviation as the instrument. We find that in Vietnam, where bride price payment is a common practice in the event of expenditure reduction resulting from adverse shocks, a household may consider marrying off their daughter as a possible coping strategy. In contrast, in India where dowry payments are common, shocks may reduce the probability of child marriage, possibly, because a girlâ€™s family is unable to meet the dowry requirements. These findings are robust to alternative ways of measuring child marriage, expenditure and rainfall deviation. We recommend that policies designed to reduce child marriage are considered in the context of cultural and social norms."

"Electrochemically active carbon nanotube (CNT) membrane filter for desalination and water purification Multi Walled Nanotube; Adsorption; Graphene Oxide Recently, extraordinary breakthroughs have been made toward applying nanostructured materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), porous graphene membranes in water purification, and desalination applications. In this regard, the potential of the electrochemically active CNT membrane has been highly strengthened for the last few decades. One of the main advantages of such approach is the capability of CNT channel to permit the water flow easily. The perusal of the literature showed that the performance of CNT-based membrane can be three times higher than that of the conventional membrane devices. The unique and excellent characteristics of CNT membrane can outperform the conventional polymer membranes. The CNT membrane has been widely used to adsorb chemical and biological contaminants as well as ion separation from seawater due to their high stability, great flexibility, and large specific surface area. Electrochemically active CNT filters deliver further electrooxidation of the adsorbed contaminants. Usually, polymeric membranes have flexible chains for which it fails to have well-defined pores necessary for filtration. On the contrary, CNT-based filters can provide pores with appropriate sizes and configurations by tailoring the growth parameters. The narrow pores of CNTs are capable of filtering water while eliminating ions (Na+/Cl-). Even this type of membrane is capable of removing bacteria from water and heavy hydrocarbon from petroleum. However, the success of desalination entirely depends on the basic design of the CNT-based filter with detailed optimization of the process parameters. Polymer filters cannot be recurrently used through several cycles since the elimination of fouling ingredients is difficult. Even though electrochemically active CNT-based membranes have lot of advantages due to their hydrophobic nature, high porosity and specific area; there are numerous traits, which are yet to be considered and optimized. Thus, the intrinsic properties of CNT and the fabrication of the membrane could be critical factors for their applicability in various water treatment processes. This chapter provides an explicit and systematic overview of the recent progress of electrochemically active CNT membranes addressing the current prevalent problems associated with water treatment and desalination. The physiochemical aspect including the working principles of this type of membrane have been discussed. The prevailing challenges and future perceptions are also discussed."

"A review of recent advances in solar cooking technology Solar Cooker; Cooking; Hot Temperature One of the primary factors affecting the amount of worldwide energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions is cooking. Solar cooking is an appropriate solution because it is both inexpensive and expandable. To illustrate modern advancements and the current status of solar cooking technology, this paper presents a review of recent experimental and analytical socioeconomic studies on solar cookers. The experimental studies have been divided into three categories based on different solar cooker structures: (i) box types, (ii) concentrating types, and (iii) panel types. Next, different designs are investigated according to their direct or indirect heat transfer modes and optional equipment for latent heat and sensible heat type thermal storage units. Moreover, reviews of studies concerning social and economic points of view and analyses of solar cooking technology are included. Different designs and configurations of solar cookers are compared for their performance, including economic aspects. Finally, some applicable solutions for current drawbacks are presented as a pathway for further investigation in solar cooking technology."

"Water/watery/watering: Concepts for Theorising in Environmental Education Water Rights; Political Ecology; Peru The assemblage of water/watery/watering is a lively cartography of how water may be accounted for when theorising with and through environmental education research. Challenging the universalising claims of Western technoscience and the colonial logic of extraction, the article develops an alternative theoretical mapping of environmental education through engagements with Ingold's (2007, 2012, 2015) concepts of lines, knots, and knotting. For this article and for the Special Issue in which it is housed, the concepts of such knottings are defined as an assemblage of haecceities, lived events that are looped, tethered and entangled as material and conceptual agencies that inhere within situated encounters. Thus, this article grapples with the need to account for water differently in contemporary posthuman ecologies. To overcome anthropocentric and mastery-oriented approaches, various other ways to account for water in science or environmental education will continue to come to the surface, bubbling and rushing like a waterfall as they have done in this work. Some of these will include thinking with water, which will be central to a theoretical mapping of water that seeks embrace sticky knots. The article explores a (re)turn to artful practices and encounters as spaces in which posthumanist concepts for environmental education might be cultivated."
"Effect of street design on pedestrian thermal comfort Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Microclimate The number of people living in urban areas is projected to increase significantly in most of the cities around the world. To address the future population increase, local governments develop new planning scenarios to increase the density in certain areas that can accommodate the growth. However, the potential threat to human health and pedestrian comfort will be exacerbated, if planning professionals exclude climatic conscious urban design in their practices. Increasing numbers of the hot days and frequent occurrence of heatwave events cause a serious threat to human life. This study investigates the effect of the future structural plans on pedestrian thermal comfort through numerical simulation using City North, Melbourne as a case study. The effect of street design towards the development of a comfortable microclimate at street level for pedestrians is investigated. To provide knowledge readily interpretable from the planning perspective, the existing and future scenarios for different street profiles are modelled and the consequences of microclimatic parameters and thermal comfort are assessed. A three-dimensional numerical modelling system, ENVI-met was used for the simulation. A clear reduction of average daytime temperature (T), mean radiant temperature (MRT) and Physiological Equivalent Temperatures (PET) were observed across the study area after implementing the â€˜Plan Melbourneâ€™ strategies. The outcomes of this study will assist urban planners in developing policies which can effectively decrease the vulnerability to the heat stress at the pedestrian level."

"Efficient Pipeline Transport of Highly Concentrated Wastewater Sludge This project aims to investigate the rheology and fluid mechanics of highly concentrated wastewater sludges and develop tools to support effective pipeline designs for wastewater treatment plants. The project expects to generate new knowledge about the complex flow of concentrated wastewater which will enable predictive models to support the design and optimization of pipeline transport systems. Expected outcomes of the project include a new toolkit that will enable wastewater treatment plants to design and optimize both existing and future pipeline systems. This will support the Australian wastewater industry to plan for future growth, increase throughput and
efficiency, reduce environmental pollutants, and capital and operating costs.
Wastewater treatment plants have identified a growing need to transport highly concentrated wastewater due to population growth and stringent environmental regulations. Current pipeline design methods are not suitable for concentrated sludge, leading to energy losses and potential pump failure. This project will develop validated, accurate and predictive models of concentrated sludge flow and a pipeline design and optimisation toolkit. Research outcomes will be incorporated into the partner organisations’ operations and disseminated to the
national Water Utilities via Water Research Australia. Research benefits are economic savings for Water Utilities, tax payers and reduced environmental impacts by reduction of discharged sludge volume. "
"Convex silica microlens arrays via femtosecond laser writing Microlens Array; Fabrication; Micro Contact Lens We report fabrication of silica convex microlens arrays with controlled shape, size, and curvature by femtosecond laser direct writing. A backside etching in dye solution was utilized for laser machining high-fidelity control of material removal and real-time surface cleaning from ablation debris. Thermal annealing was applied to reduce surface roughness to 3 nm (rms). The good optical performance of the arrays was confirmed by focusing and imaging tests. Complex 3D micro-optical elements over a footprint of 100 Ã— 100 Âµm2 were ablated within 1 h (required for practical applications). A material removal speed of 120 Âµm3/s (6 Ã— 105 nm3/pulse) was used, which is more than an order of magnitude higher compared to backside etching using a mask projection method. The method is applicable for fabrication of micro-optical components on transparent hard materials."

"Feminist academic organizations: Challenging sexism through collective mobilizing across research, support, and advocacy Feminism; Identity Work; Organization Studies This paper examines the establishment of a feminist academic organization, GENMAC (Gender, Markets, and Consumers; genmac.co), serving gender scholars in business schools and related fields. In so doing, it builds on the emerging literature of feminist academic organizations, as situated within feminist organizational studies (FOS). Through a feminist case study and by assessing the reflections of GENMAC's board members, we tell the story of the emergence of GENMAC and detail the tensions the organization encountered as it formally established itself as a feminist organization within the confines of a business school setting, a patriarchal system, and a neoliberal university paradigm. We build on the FOS literature by considering how our organization counters cultures of heightened individualism and builds collective action to challenge sexism through the nexus of research, support, and advocacy pillars of our organization. We demonstrate how, through these actions, our organization challenges hierarchies of knowledge, prioritizes the care and support needed for the day-to-day survival of gender scholars in business schools, and spotlights and challenges structural inequalities and injustices in the academy."

"A Review on Multi-Terminal High Voltage Direct Current Networks for Wind Power Integration High Voltage Direct Current System; Offshore Wind Farms; Converter With the growing pressure to substitute fossil fuel-based generation, Renewable Energy Sources (RES) have become one of the main solutions from the power sector in the fight against climate change. Offshore wind farms, for example, are an interesting alternative to increase renewable power production, but they represent a challenge when being interconnected to the grid, since new installations are being pushed further off the coast due to noise and visual pollution restrictions. In this context, Multi-Terminal High Voltage Direct Current (MT-HVDC) networks are the most preferred technology for this purpose and for onshore grid reinforcements. They also enable the delivery of power from the shore to offshore Oil and Gas (O&G) production platforms, which can help lower the emissions in the transition away from fossil fuels. In this work, we review relevant aspects of the operation and control of MT-HVDC networks for wind power integration. The review approaches topics such as the main characteristics of MT-HVDC projects under discussion/commissioned around the world, rising challenges in the control and the operation of MT-HVDC networks and the modeling and the control of the Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) stations. To illustrate the challenges on designing the control system of a MT-HVDC network and to corroborate the technical discussions, a simulation of a three-terminal MT-HVDC network integrating wind power generation and offshore O&G production units to the onshore grid is performed in Matlabâ€™s Simscape Electrical toolbox. The results highlight the main differences between two alternatives to design the control system for an MT-HVDC network."
"Effect of build orientation on the quasi-static and dynamic response of SLM AlSi10Mg Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Selective Laser Melting (SLM) allows the fabrication of complex geometries with high resolution and robust mechanical properties. However, the manner of manufacture â€“ melting of metallic powder with a laser power source â€“ affects microstructure and results in mechanical anisotropy. While some studies have sought to characterise the microstructure and performance of SLM AlSi10Mg, the dynamic response, particularly with regard to anisotropic effects, remains relatively undefined. To overcome this deficit AlSi10Mg specimens were fabricated using SLM with three different build orientations, and quasi-static and dynamic split-Hopkinson tensile bar tests were performed to characterise the tensile properties of the material at strain rates ranging from 3.33 x 10-2 to 2.4 x 103 s-1. The microstructure of as-manufactured specimens and fracture surfaces of failed specimens were analysed. Quasi-static and dynamic results showed little difference between build orientations with regard to strength, but components loaded perpendicular to the build direction were found to be more ductile than other build orientations. Significant scatter was observed in dynamic results, suggesting no strain rate sensitivity of the material in the tested strain rate range. Build orientation was found to affect fracture surface morphology of dynamically tested specimens due to fracture paths following melt pool boundaries. These results assist in the characterisation of the anisotropic effects of build orientation on quasi-static and dynamic behaviours of SLM AlSi10Mg towards the further commercial adoption of the manufacturing technique and material."

"Business students’ reflection on reflective writing assessments Electronic Portfolio; Medical Students; Journal Entries Purpose: This paper provides an analysis of the experiences of undergraduate business students undertaking reflective writing as a series of incremental assessments. Using Moonâ€™s map of learning (1999) as an analytical framework, it explores the value of reflective writing to students studying Asian culture in the business context during the first semester of 2017. Design/methodology/approach: With 200 enrolments, the authors taught a core business course, Asian culture in the business context, in the first semester in 2017. The value of the assessments is analysed based on two data sources: written course feedback via a course survey and a combination of semi-structured interviews and focus groups. The written course feedback was collected by the university during the semester. Approximately, one-third of the students (n = 63) participated in the survey. The other data were collected through semi-structured interviews and focus groups for nine students. Ethical approval for the collection of data was obtained from the university ethics committee. Findings: The study confirms that reflective writing enables students to make meaning of their learning and transfer it to the cultural context of business practice. In addition, the assessments help the students develop logical thinking and academic writing skills. To increase the use of reflective assignments in business programmes, further research and teaching practice is required. Research limitations/implications: A limitation of this research was the relatively small sample size. Even though written survey feedback (n = 63) was used to complement the number of interviewees (n = 9), the findings of the data analysis may not represent the experiences of all students in the course. However, the data are valuable to bridge a gap between the existing research and teaching practice on the use of reflective writing in other disciplines and business education. Practical implications: Although the transfer of academic knowledge to business practice is a core capability of the business programmes, business students may not obtain this during their study in the programme. Several students mentioned a lack of opportunity to apply reflective writing skills to other courses in their business degree, except one core course using a reflective essay as an assessment. This implies that the majority of the students in the degree are not exposed to situations that require them to critically evaluate, consolidate and consider what has been taught in relation to future practice. Social implications: Further research and practice will increase the popularity of reflective writing assessments in business programmes. As Hedberg suggests, reflective practice should be integrated into all classrooms in business education. Together with analysis and action, reflection should be a core capability for managers (Hedberg 2009). In addition, the business faculty needs to work in a reflective manner that encourages students to be familiar with the reflective practice. Originality/value: This paper analyses the pedagogical aspects of reflection based on the experience of undergraduate business students undertaking reflective writing assessments."

"A review of microalgal biofuels, challenges and future directions Biofuel; Nannochloropsis; Chlorella Sorokiniana Fossil fuels play an absolute dominant role in the global energy mix, followed by biofuels and other energy sources. Fossil fuel dependency is unsustainable due to its finite nature. Moreover, a large amount of greenhouse gas emission is generated by the use of fossil fuels. Biofuels from microalgae have the potential to provide a sustainable and carbon-neutral energy source, complementing the shortfall of fossil fuels and enhancing the mitigation of global warming. One of the notable advantages of biofuels from microalgae is that it does not pose any threat to human or animal food chain and its production can be achieved using barren land, salt water, wastewater and CO2 emitted by thermal power plants. Despite having enormous potential, current production, harvesting and processing techniques of microalgal biomass remain not cost-effective or widely used. Hence, further optimisation of microalgal mass culture, harvesting and processing techniques, and efficient utilisation of by-products are needed to make this carbon-neutral energy source economically viable and sustainable. Coupling microalgae cultivation with wastewater and CO2 from power plants is considered a promising route for the production of bioenergy and bio-based by-products. Significant challenges remain to be addressed to utilise the full potential of third-generation biofuel derived mainly from microalgal biomasses. This chapter presents a brief view of the current progress on microalgal biofuel production, its future directions and challenges."
"Comparing Resampling Algorithms and Classifiers for Modeling Traffic Risk Prediction Crash Injuries; Crash; Random Parameters Road infrastructure has significant effects on road traffic safety and needs further examination. In terms of traffic crash prediction, recent studies have started to develop deep learning classification algorithms. However, given the uncertainty of traffic crashes, predicting the traffic risk potential of different road sections remains a challenge. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigated a real-world expressway and collected its traffic crash data between 2013 and 2020. Then, according to the time-spatial density ratio (Pts), road sections were assigned into three classes corresponding to low, medium, and high risk levels of traffic. Next, different classifiers were compared that were trained using the transformed and resampled feature data to construct a traffic crash risk prediction model. Last, but not least, partial dependence plots (PDPs) were employed to interpret the results and analyze the importance of individual features describing the geometry, pavement, structure, and weather conditions. The results showed that a variety of data balancing algorithms improved the performance of the classifiers, the ensemble classifier superseded the others in terms of the performance metrics, and the combined SMOTEENN and random forest algorithms improved the classification accuracy the most. In the future, the proposed traffic crash risk prediction method will be tested in more road maintenance and design safety assessment scenarios."

"Enhancing radiotherapy with a novel 53BP1 inhibitor The donor expects that the funds provided will be applied exclusively to the project. In the event the project is discontinued, the donor agrees to the funds be reallocated within the School of Science, Medical sciences programs for research purposes.

Project Aims:
A hallmark of cancer is impaired DNA repair rendering cancer cells mutagenic and vulnerable to DNA
damage, which is exploited in radiotherapy. The principle DNA repair mechanism in cancer is nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which is regulated by the epigenetic protein 53BP11,2. Silencing of 53BP1 increases cancer cell radiation sensitivity, increasing DNA damage cell death3. Recently, Dr Headey developed a small molecule inhibitor of 53BP1 (EoHR). The aim of this proposal is to
demonstrate enhanced tumour cell death when EoHR is used in conjunction with radiation in a variety of
cancer cells as proof of concept for future translational studies."

"Combination of steam explosion and ionic liquid pretreatments for efficient utilization of fungal chitin from citric acid fermentation residue Biomass; Delignification; Ethanol Production Aspergillus niger mycelium residues, a citric acid fermentation by-product, is a raw material for fungal chitosan and glucosamine (GlcN). However, traditional chemical extraction of fungal chitosan and GlcN uses strong acid at high temperatures for long periods and has several drawbacks, including high cost and environmental pollution. In this work, the residues were pretreated by the combination of steam explosion (SE) and ionic liquid (IL) to produce fungal chitosan and GlcN hydrochloride. Following chemical extraction, GlcN hydrochloride yield increased by 65.49 Â± 8.14%, and soluble sugar release reached 0.36â€“0.46 g/g via SE pretreatment at 2.5 MPa for 1 min. Fungal chitosan was produced via enzymatic hydrolysis. Combined SE and IL pretreatment increased deacetylation degree (1.29 Â± 0.06-fold) of fungal chitosan by chitin deacetylase hydrolysis using Rhodococcus equi CGMCC14861 (ReCDA) at 37 Â°C for 6 h. Besides, fungal chitosan was produced using a by-product recycling strategy, promoting ReCDA fermentation, using supernatant with soluble sugars and proteins. After mixing 0.2 g by-product supernatant with 100 mL medium, ReCDA production was 1.5-fold higher than that in the control. This study demonstrates a green technology for efficient utilization of fungal chitin from A. niger mycelium residues of citric acid fermentation."

"Factors influencing property selection for conservation revolving funds Easement; Private Lands; Landowners Finding sustainable ways to increase the amount of private land protected for biodiversity is challenging for many conservation organizations. In some countries, organizations use revolving-fund programs, whereby land is purchased and then sold to conservation-minded owners under condition they enter into a conservation covenant or easement. The sale proceeds are used to purchase, protect, and sell additional properties, incrementally increasing the amount of protected private land. Because the effectiveness of this approach relies on selecting appropriate properties, we explored factors currently considered by practitioners and how these are integrated into decision making. We conducted exploratory, semistructured interviews with managers from each of the 5 major revolving funds in Australia. Responses indicated although conservation factors are important, financial and social factors are also highly influential. A major determinant was whether the property could be resold within a reasonable period at a price that replenishes the fund. To facilitate resale, often selected properties include the potential for the construction of a dwelling. Practitioners face with clear trade-offs between conservation, financial, amenity, and other factors in selecting properties and 3 main challenges: recovering the costs of acquisition, protection, and resale; reselling the property; and meeting conservation goals. Our findings suggest the complexity of these decisions may constrain revolving-fund effectiveness. Drawing from participant responses, we identified potential strategies to mitigate these risks, such as providing adequate recreational space without jeopardizing ecological assets. We suggest managers could benefit from a shared-learning and adaptive approach to property selection given the commonalities between programs. Understanding how practitioners deal with complex decisions in the implementation of revolving funds helps identify future research to improve the performance of this conservation tool."

"A Review of the Potential Impacts of Wind Turbine Noise in the Australian Context Wind Farms; Wind Power; Social Rejection This manuscript describes a range of technical deliberations undertaken by the authors during their work as members of the Australian Governmentâ€™s Independent Scientific Committee on Wind Turbines. Central to these deliberations was the requirement upon the committee to improve understanding and monitoring of the potential impacts of sound from wind turbines (including low frequency and infrasound) on health and the environment. The paper examines existing wind turbine sound limits, possible perceptual and physiological effects of wind turbine noise, aspects of the effects of wind turbine sound on sleep health and quality of life, low-frequency noise limits, the concept of annoyance including alternative causes of it and the potential for it to be affected by low-frequency noise, the influence of amplitude modulation and tonality, sound measurement and analysis and management strategies. In so doing it provides an objective basis for harmonisation across Australia of provisions for siting and monitoring of wind turbines, which currently vary from state to state, contributing to contention and potential inequities between Australians, depending on their place of residence."

"Respect@Uni: A feminist insider perspective on respect-based culture change in higher education Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science This article provides feminist insider perspectives on the development and delivery of an innovative respect-based sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH) prevention initiative in higher education. The initiative is designed specifically to address risk factors in graduate research. It is one of the first of its kind world-wide. Respect and cognate, moderate feminist, concepts are increasingly prevalent as oblique, or stealth, approaches to gender equality in contexts in which doing so openly may be counterproductive. The respect-based initiative examined here addresses the various risk factors that distinguish graduate research from undergraduate education, particularly power imbalances. Adopting a feminist reflective practice methodology, we provide an insider perspective into the multi-layered processes involved in enabling and undertaking institution-wide culture change of this kind. Our critical reflections focus on the stealth approaches adopted during design and delivery, highlighting resistance and receptivity to the initiative and how these were either countered or harnessed. The article provides both practical and theoretical insights into the advantages and limitations of respect-based culture-change. Most notably, it contributes to enhanced understanding of what works in practice, for which there is an urgent need."

"Helicobacter pylori Infection Elicits Type i Interferon Response in Human Monocytes via Toll-Like Receptor 8 Signaling Signal Transduction; CBLB502; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88 Helicobacter pylori colonization and persistence could precede gastric adenocarcinoma. Elucidating immune recognition strategies of H. pylori is therefore imperative to curb chronic persistence in the human host. Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR8 are widely known as viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) sensors yet less studied in the bacteria context. Here, we investigated the involvement of these receptors in the immunity to H. pylori. Human THP-1 monocytic cells were infected with H. pylori, and the expression levels of human Toll-like receptors (TLRs) were examined. The roles of TLR7 and TLR8 in response to H. pylori infection were further investigated using receptor antagonists. Among all TLR transcripts examined, TLR8 exhibited the most prominent upregulation, followed by TLR7 in the THP-1 cells infected with H. pylori J99 or SS1 strains. H. pylori infection-mediated IFN-Î± and IFN-Î² transactivation was significantly abrogated by the TLR7/8 (but not TLR7) antagonist. Additionally, TLR7/8 antagonist treatment reduced H. pylori infection-mediated phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7). Our study suggests a novel role of TLR8 signaling in host immunity against H. pylori through sensing live bacteria to elicit the production of type I interferon."

"Improvement of heavy metal removal from urban runoff using modified pervious concrete Asphalt; Stormwater; Asphalt Mixtures Heavy metals are one of the major chemical pollutant groups in urban runoff. The application of porous concrete is a potential alternative to conventional runoff management systems with the ability to remove heavy metals. Hence, a thorough understanding of the heavy metal removal mechanisms and constraints of conventional porous concrete opens a path for the development of effective modifications. This review critically discusses the major contributors in ordinary porous concrete which supports heavy metal removal. The effects of initial concentration, contact time and competing ions on heavy metal removal using porous concrete are also discussed. Additionally, the effect of decalcification, atmospheric carbonation, acid influent on heavy metal removal is reviewed. The major drawback of porous concrete is the high pH (>8.5) of the effluent water, decalcification of the porous concrete and leaching of adsorbed pollutants. Overall, the addition of adsorbent materials to the porous concrete increases removal efficiencies (7% - 65% increase) without neutralizing the effluent pH. Meanwhile, the addition of Reduced Graphene Oxide is successful in reducing the leachability of the removed heavy metals. The addition of pozzolanic materials can lower the effluent pH while maintaining similar removal efficiencies to unmodified porous concrete. Therefore, developing a novel method of neutralizing the effluent pH must be prioritized in future studies. Additionally, the toxicity that can occur due to the abrasion of modified porous concrete requires study in future research. Further, advanced characterization methods should be used in future studies to understand the mechanisms of removal via the modified porous concrete materials."

"Development of Cryptographic Library and Support System The protection of the whole cyber space relies on a foundation of cryptography. Cryptographic components of apps authenticate remote parties and secure the communications. However, cryptographic misuse has become a most common issue in development of security component, affecting up to 90% of apps! This project aims to research, design and develop a crypto library. The innovation of this project lays in three aspects: (1) we will develop a self-contained, reliable, compatible and verifiable crypto library; (2) we will develop
security test software automatically to test and verify security of codes; and (3) we will provide intelligent decision support through argumentation to help developers to apply the library efficiently and correctly. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any crypto library developed in Australia yet. After the completion of the project, we will collaborate with Australian industries to adapt the crypto library to meet their security requirements. This project will benefit Australia in cybersecurity research and economy. Australia loses
about 29 billions per year due to security incidents. This project will reduce the risk by reducing the potentially dangerous crypto errors caused by using the crypto library in the application development and implementation."

"Influence of pyrolysis parameters on phosphorus fractions of biosolids derived biochar Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Transforming biosolids into biochar, through pyrolysis, could result in more sustainable waste management. Influence of pyrolysis conditions (temperature, heating rate and residence time) on physico-chemical properties of biosolids (collected at Mount Martha Water Recycling Plant, Melbourne), phosphorus fractions and phosphorus forms was investigated. Twelve different biochar samples were produced at 400, 500 and 600 Â°C, at two heating rates (5 and 20 Â°C/min) and at two residence times (30 and 120 min). Biochar yield, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), elements (C, H and N) and BET surface area were analysed. Sequential extraction of P in biosolids and resultant biochars was done using Hedley method. Characterization was completed with SEM images and results from 31P liquid state NMR. Increased temperatures would not only increase the alkalinity, decrease EC and increase the adsorption capacity by increasing the surface area but also convert the readily available P to a less available pool. Therefore, this nutrient might be released to soil slowly over a longer period of time. The results showed that temperature, along with residence time and heating rate, had a significant effect on the characteristics observed. Therefore, all these factors need to be carefully considered when preparing biochar for use as a soil amendment."

"Controlling digestion kinetics through food microstructure design (PhD student: Ms Meltem Bayrak) Understanding of food nano- and micro structure helps to design better food systems with improved nutrition and health benefits. The proposed research aims to understand the influence of nano- and microstructure on the digestibility of model dairy products, particularly focusing on a pure micellar casein system. Structure of casein gels exposed to digestion with an identical composition, but differing by the coagulation mode, will be examined to solve the link between food microstructure and bioaccesibility of nutrients. The fundamental
understanding obtained will further assist in the development of targeted design of food matrix for controlled breakdown of food products and thus personalized foods for optimum well-being such as health care products with specific rheological behavior at very high protein content. The proposed study could also create a new opportunity of industry collaboration between nutraceutical and food manufacturers."

"Localisation of the Sustainable Development Goals in an emerging nation Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), agreed to by all member countries of the United Nations, require urgent action on the world's most pressing problems. Success requires bottom-up participation of local stakeholders. This case study of Timor-Lesteâ€”a fledgling, fossil fuel-supported economyâ€”maps the awareness and commitment of grassroots stakeholders to the SDGs and the roadblocks to localisation. Guiding this paper is Habermasâ€™ view of societal evolution and communicative action, which aids analysing the socio-political and structural dynamics affecting SDGs localisation in a developing nation. This study reveals stakeholder inability to articulate a clear vision for the SDGs, lack of human capital and funds, a weak public-administrative system, strong socio-political nuances, and poor governance infrastructure to support multi-stakeholder relationships. This paper provides insights for developing a more nuanced and robust public intervention to support local stakeholders that will enable knowledge, cultural and communication transformations required for successful SDGs localisation."
"Energy balance method for modeling ultimate strain of fiber-reinforced polymer-repaired concrete Axial Compression; Polymers; Jackets The energy balance method has been widely used in the extant literature to derive the ultimate axial strain of conventional confined concrete columns. However, researchers noted that this method yields unrealistic results compared to experimental data when it is applied to fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) confined concrete columns. Therefore, it is deemed that the existing ultimate strain model based on the energy method cannot be directly applied to FRP-repaired concrete. With this model shortcoming in mind and through a theoretical analysis with proper calibration, the current study extended the energy balance approach to develop a generalized model to determine the ultimate strain of FRP repaired concrete columns. This proposed new model can be used to predict the ultimate strain of repaired columns under both concentric and eccentric loadings. Because this model is established in a unified form without any restrictions to the cross-sectional geometry, it is applicable to different shapes of repaired columns. On the other hand, although the energy balance method is unconservative for heavily damaged concrete, it exhibits a better performance with respect to the existing models when compared with the test result."

"Polydopamine-induced in-situ growth of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8/TiO2 nanoparticles on cotton fabrics for photocatalytic performance Bis(1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylate)Tricopper(II); MIL-101; Adsorption Excellent photocatalytic activity was achieved on textiles via polydopamine-assisted deposition of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 (ZIF-8)/TiO2 composite nanoparticles. Cotton fabrics as the substrate were templated with polydopamine followed by in-situ deposition of ZIF-8/TiO2 photocatalysts. The heterogeneous nucleation growth of ZIF-8 was effectively improved by the chelation effects between polydopamine and Zn2+. SEM, FTIR, XPS, XRD, and TG analysis were employed to study the morphology, chemical constituent, micro-structure and thermal stability of ZIF-8/TiO2 deposited fabrics. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra have indicated that the composite structure is beneficial in improving the charge transfer ability and decreasing the re-union rate of photogenerated electron pair holes. The mechanism was proposed to reveal both the in-situ deposition of nanocomposites on fiber surface and photocatalytic activity. The ZIF-8/TiO2 deposited cotton fabrics exhibit good photocatalytic activity and recyclability leading to potential industrial wastewater treatment applications."
"Using measures of efficiency for regionally-targeted smallholder policy intervention: The case of Pakistan's horticulture sector Agriculture; Stochastic Frontier Model; Metafrontier The empirical literature on the sources of production efficiency mostly focuses on technical and scale efficiency, and the relative importance of mix efficiency is often overlooked. This paper estimates input-oriented technical and mix efficiency using a farm-level survey dataset of 730 smallholder horticulture farms in Pakistan. We estimate a Bayesian stochastic production frontier model to draw precise statistical inferences by using finite sample properties. We find that the estimated mean mix inefficiency (0.65) is roughly as large as mean technical inefficiency (0.64). Moreover, we detect large technical and mix efficiency disparities across agro-climatic zones and farm sizes, which we attribute to suboptimal farm practices. We conclude that policy-makers should focus on strategies that target to improve both technical and mix inefficiency."
"Inhalation health risk assessment for the human tracheobronchial tree under pm exposure in a bus stop scene Aerosol; Dry Powder Inhalers; Particle Transport Inhalation exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) can induce respiratory/cardiovascular disease and lung cancer in humans. Determining the specific particle deposition distribution in the human tracheobronchial tree is crucial to evaluating the health risk. Thus, an integrated human nasal-oral-tracheobronchial airway model was employed to study the particle deposition, and empirical equations for calculating the lung lobe risk contribution fractions were developed. The risk contribution of each lobe to non-carcinogenesis and carcinogenesis was predicted using prior experimental data collected at a bus stop. The regional inhalation health risk was analyzed by evaluating the hazard quotient (HQ) and excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) of selected non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic elements (viz., Cr, Mn, and Ni). Fine particles (10 nmâ€“1 Âµm) contributed the highest risk fractions for the lung lobes, inducing higher potential health consequences in the lungs than coarser particles. Cr posed carcinogenic lung risks to people who commuted by public transport, with the ELCR to every lobe exceeding the recommended limit. The non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were 1.5 times greater for the right lung than for the left lung. Of the lung lobes, the RLL incurred the highest risk, followed by the LLL, RUL, LUL, and RML. Inhalation exposure to Cr posed a much higher risk to the lungs than exposure to Ni and Mn. However, compared to the other two elements, Mn potentially induced a higher chance of developing upper respiratory disease."

"Vignette question design for the assessment of graduate sustainability learning outcomes Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development The development of university wide graduate attributes has become an important mechanism for setting generic learning outcomes across higher education institutions. Many universities around the world have developed sets of graduate attributes that they aim to develop through degree programs. Sustainability related attributes have been included in numerous university attribute statements, however, little research exists on methods that can be used to capture data on the application and use of these attributes by graduates. This paper evaluates an assessment tool, based on a scenario/vignette question design, which can be used to capture data on graduate attributes in context and has the potential to be used across a large graduate population which would enable comparative research of learning outcomes to be undertaken. An evaluation of the usefulness of the scenario/vignette design will be presented based on a pilot of the question design with a sample of RMIT University graduates. The results of the pilot show that scenario/vignettes address some of the limitations of existing self-assessment methods and represent a novel way to collect data on graduate sustainability attributes post-degree completion."
"Perceived barriers and facilitators to workplace exercise participation Presenteeism; Health Promotion; Workplace Purpose: Workplace exercise programmes have been shown to increase employee participation in physical activities and improve health and fitness in the short-term. However, the limited breadth of employee engagement across organisations combined with declining exercise adherence within individual studies indicates a need for better-informed programmes. The purpose of this paper is to investigate relationships between employee moderate-vigorous physical activity (exercise) participation and their perceived barriers and facilitators to engagement in onsite exercise, to inform the design and implementation of future workplace exercise interventions. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey identified employee demographics, exercise (International Physical Activity Questionnaire), perceived barriers (Corporate Exercise Barriers Scale) and facilitators to exercise at an Australian university. Findings: Of the 252 full-time employees who responded, most reported meeting (43.7 per cent) or exceeding (42.9 per cent) exercise guidelines over the previous week. A lack of time or reduced motivation (p<0.001), exercise attitude (p<0.05), internal (p<0.01) and external (p<0.01) barriers towards workplace exercise participation were all associated with failure to attain government-recommended volumes of weekly exercise. Personal training (particularly for insufficiently active employees) and group exercise classes were identified as potential exercise facilitators. Walking, gym (fitness centre), swimming and cycling were identified as the preferred modes of exercise training. Practical implications: Employees not meeting recommended volumes of exercise might require additional support such as individualised gym and cycling programmes with personal supervision to overcome reported exercise barriers to improve exercise participation, health and fitness. Originality/value: This study identifies specific barriers and facilitators to workplace exercise participation perceived by university employees. These findings can be used to inform the design and implementation of workplace exercise programmes aiming to achieve wider workplace engagement and greater exercise adherence, particularly of less active employees."
"Suitability Prediction and Enhancement of Future Water Supply Systems in Barwon Region in Victoria, Australia Environmental Assessment; Landscape Fragmentation; China Intensive agricultural production accompanied by the climate change impacts in postColonial rural landscapes have continuously increased the demand for water resources and coastal areas, showing an unprecedented water supply crisis. By taking extreme weather conditions and rainfall events for future trends, a resilient water storage facility for the landscape requires the collaborative approach of natural systems and simulation modelling techniques to develop sustainable future scenarios. In this study, an ecological suitability model is used to identify potential sites for the construction of multi-purpose dams. As part of the model structure, multi factors are classified using the patterns of changing landscapes, and then weighted overlay analysis is conducted on a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. Compared to previous studies, this paper derives its principal impact parameters and projections based on historical land cover information. The suitability maps that are generated visually guide the geographical location of the multi-purpose dams and indicate the areas from highly suitable to least suitable, clarifying the possibility of building blue infrastructure alongside the waterways in west-central Barwon. The workflow proposes a resilient water system based on existing land characteristics and measures that future water storage capacity will be a valid increase of approximately 1.5 times. This strategy alleviates water scarcity during the dry season to benefit traditional agricultural activities. Digital calculations are utilized to demonstrate the feasibility of the experimental results, providing a methodology for regulating the distribution and supply of river flows throughout the year while retaining runoff in a hierarchical pattern at precipitation periods."

"Life cycle assessment of alkali-activated concretes under marine exposure in an Australian context Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali Alkali-activated concretes have been shown to be an environmentally advantageous construction material as they utilize waste or by-products as precursors, such as fly ash and ground blast furnace slag. These concretes also have the ability to achieve strengths suitable for structural applications. However, each mix design of an alkali-activated concretes is unique and requires a detailed life cycle analysis to determine the environmental impact and cost viability. This study evaluates the feasibility of alkali-activated fly ash or fly ash geopolymer and alkali-activated slag concrete developed for application in Australia currently subject to long term site performance studies. This paper reports a detailed life cycle assessment analysis of these concretes to assess their environmental footprint. The paper considers three distinct allocation methods: baseline, mass, and economic allocation, with two system boundaries: manufacture and construction. The study shows AAS concrete has a lower environmental impact than an equivalent strength PC concrete in two impact categories, global warming potential and eutrophication, while acidification and human toxicity depend on the allocation method applied in the manufacturing stage. The global warming potential (100-years) of AAS is 5.25â€“35% less than PC concrete. The FAGP concrete has more negative impacts on the environment than PC-based concrete, regardless of which allocation method is applied. The report highlights alkaline activators and transportation of raw materials as the main environmental impact contributors to concrete manufacture. The global warming potential of FAGP is 22â€“34% higher than the equivalent PC concrete in the baseline method. For the construction stage boundary, machinery appliances for handling concrete and transportation only contributes a small environmental impact (<4%) compared with concrete manufacturing. Cost estimation for concrete production suggests that the cost of the alkali-activated concrete is competitive with the conventional concrete market, dependant on the proximity of the feedstocks and the cost of sodium silicate. Neglecting the transportation cost of feedstocks, the cost of AAS concrete can be 4.8% cheaper, whereas the cost of FAGP concrete is 2.7% more expensive than PC concrete."

"Institutional betrayal and sexual harassment in STEM institutions: evidence from science and technology universities of Ethiopia Sexual Harassment; Workplace; Sexism In this paper, we examine the experiences of female students and academics to understand the factors that underpin the persistence of sexual harassment in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) institutions. We draw on data from interviews and focus group discussions with female students and academics who participated in a study that focuses on gender inequality in science and technology universities in Ethiopia. Drawing on the concept of institutional betrayal, we argue that the high prevalence of sexual harassment in these universities is perpetuated by institutional actions and inactions through which universities fail to proactively prevent and effectively respond to sexual harassment. We suggest efforts to tackle sexual harassment need to focus on proactive and preventive measures that involve revisiting institutional policies and structures. We further suggest that grievance procedures need to be accessible, responsive, trustworthy and supportive."
"City of Hope-Quality of Life Questionnaire-Arabic Version: Assessment of Reliability and Validity Ostomy; Stomata; Enterostomy BACKGROUND: Arabic is spoken as a native language by more than 400 million people worldwide. However, there is no specific Arabic language instrument to measure stoma-related quality of life. PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess the validity and reliability of the City of Hope-quality of life-Ostomy Questionnaire (COH-QOL-OQ) Arabic version. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used. Intra-class correlation coefficients were calculated to measure reliability, and Pearsonâ€™s correlations of an item with its own scale and other scales were scored to evaluate convergent and discriminant validity. Content validity was reviewed by a panel of 5 experts. RESULTS: There were 421 participants with colostomy, ileostomy, or urostomy (239 [56.8%] male and 182 [43.2%] female). All COH-QOL-OQ subscales for the Arabic version demonstrated a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach's Î± = 0.71-0.87). The initial administration of the confirmatory factor analysis model showed inadequate goodness-of-fit indices (Ï‡Â²/df = 3.902, NFI =.845, CFI =.880, RMSEA = 0.083). However, after removing item 2 in the social dimension, the final administration of the confirmatory factor analysis model showed significant goodness-of-fit indices (Ï‡Â²/df = 2.663, NFI =.900, CFI =.935, RMSEA = 0.063). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the COH-QOL-OQ Arabic version is a valid and reliable tool to measure quality of life among patients with an ostomy in Saudi Arabia."
"Wellbeing as social care: On assemblages and the ‘commons’ Mental Health Recovery; Peer Group; Mental Disease Time spent within either mental health inpatient units or residential substance use treatment services affects subjectivities and social relations in complex ways. This paper draws on recent currents in â€˜assemblage thinkingâ€™, alongside Lauren Berlant's discussion of â€˜the commonsâ€™, to explore these disruptions and propose new ways of thinking about the relations of support, wellbeing and care that may emerge within treatment. Care within these spaces can be understood as a sociotechnical assemblage â€“ what Berlant calls a â€œpatterning of social formâ€ â€“ that organises expressions of wellbeing in the promotion of distinctive modes of social wellbeing. These modes respond to infrastructural â€˜glitchesâ€™ â€“ breakdowns in social forms that typically accompany (if not directly cause) pathways into treatment â€“ generating unique embodied expressions of social care, wellbeing, health and recovery. Drawing on qualitative data collected among individuals leaving mental health and/or substance use treatment settings in either Victoria or New South Wales, we argue that care may be understood by way of a series of social, affective and material techniques for restoring complex socio-material assemblages of care and recovery. This approach moves beyond the individual subject of health and illness to consider the wider repertoires of social, affective and material events, relations and practices that sustain wellbeing as a distinctive mode of social care, what Kim McLeod calls a â€˜wellbeing machineâ€™. This machine reimagines social care by way of pooled affective, material and embodied resources, and the ways that bodies draw upon these common resources in the restoration of assemblages of care and support. Revisioning care in this way offers new ways of thinking about the social, affective and material infrastructures needed to sustain wellbeing for individuals leaving treatment."

"Precarity and progression during a pandemic. Preliminary findings from a study of early career academics’ information behaviour during COVID-19 Information Behaviour; Information Retrieval; Web Search Introduction. COVID-19 has increased research, teaching and administrative pressures for all academics and, by doing so, exacerbated inequalities experienced by early-career academics, who were already dealing with several sources of uncertainty in trying to establish their careers. This study sought to understand the experiences of the academics during the pandemic. Method. We conducted semi-structured remote interviews with 18 early-career academics (PhDs awarded in past 6 years), from a variety of countries; Canada, US, Australia, UK, New Zealand, and South Africa. Analysis. Interviews were analysed using a reflexive inductive Thematic Analysis approach Results. Preliminary findings demonstrate that the pandemic has disrupted information acquisition and sharing among early-career academics. The increasing amount of incorrect and irrelevant information disseminated by universities, alongside the de-prioritisation of information that is particularly valued by these academics (e.g., information related to professional development and career development) has led some to avoid information Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the precarious situations faced. Universities need to acknowledge uncertainty, reduce information overload by providing relevant and useful information and provide useful information on and support for career progression."
"Effects of whole-body vibration on driver drowsiness: A review Fatigue; Mental Fatigue; Electrooculogram Introduction: Whole-body vibration has direct impacts on driver vigilance by increasing physical and cognitive stress on the driver, which leads to drowsiness, fatigue and road traffic accidents. Although sleep deprivation, sleep apnoea and alcohol consumption can also lead to driver drowsiness, exposure to steady vibration is the factor most readily controlled by changes to vehicle design, yet it has received comparatively less attention. Methods: This review investigated interrelationships between the various components of whole-body vibration and the physiological and cognitive parameters that lead to driver drowsiness, as well as the effects of vibration parameters (frequency, amplitude, waveform and duration). Vibrations transmitted to the driver body from the vehicle floor and/or seat have been considered for this review, whereas hand-arm vibration, shocks, acute or transient vibration were excluded from consideration. Results: Drowsiness is affected by interactions between the frequency, amplitude, waveform and duration of the vibration. Under optimal conditions, whole-body vibration can induce significant drowsiness within 30 min. Low frequency whole-body vibrations, particularly vibrations of 4â€“10 Hz, are most effective at inducing drowsiness. This review notes some limitations of current studies and suggests directions for future research. Conclusions: This review demonstrated a strong causal link exists between whole-body vibration and driver drowsiness. Since driver drowsiness has been established to be a significant contributor to motor vehicle accidents, research is needed to identify ways to minimise the components of whole-body vibration that contribute to drowsiness, as well as devising more effective ways to counteract drowsiness. Practical Applications: By raising awareness of the vibrational factors that contribute to drowsiness, manufacturers will be prompted to design vehicles that reduce the influence of these factors."

"Accounting graduate readiness for work: a case study of South East Asia Accounting Education; Accountants; Competency Purpose: This paper compares and contrasts graduate accountant skills and employers' expectations in South East Asia (SEA). Design/methodology/approach: We analyse the employers' expectation performance gap (EPG) in three countries â€“ Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam â€“ to provide a reflection on current professional accounting development in SEA. The study relies on data derived from multiple sources including job advertisements, CIMA â€œready for businessâ€ project, Glassdoor website and other secondary data sources. Findings: The findings indicate that over recent decades, the changing nature of the economy, state, and interest of the business sector (including the â€œBig Fourâ€) have led to the wider adoption of professional accountancy qualifications. The findings suggest that graduates should be equipped with active learning activities such as project-based and work-integrated training to fill the expectation gaps between local university educators and employers. Research limitations/implications: Drawing upon a literature review of professional accounting education, we use the results of the documentations and secondary analysis to describe the performance expectation gap of accounting education in SEA. Originality/value: The study indicates a large discrepancy between the teachings in accounting education and employer requirements in Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia and propose different methods to fill this employability gap in South East Asia."

"Using the ReSOLVE framework for circularity in the building and construction industry in emerging markets Industrial Symbiosis; Sustainable Development; Circular Economy Circularity supports the move from linear to circular systems where more efficient, zero waste systems are created by closing material inputs and loops. The design, maintenance, manufacturing and use ensure virgin materials are no longer needed for day to day living. For the built environment sector, building materials and its use underpins the trajectory of circularity in the sector. Improved building materials, increased standardization and appropriate storage and transportation may reduce waste. Increased adaptability and multi-use spaces in buildings support multiple occupants and end users. This paper focuses on understanding the requirements to move to a circular pathway for the building and construction sector in emerging markets, using secondary literature and case studies. The ReSOLVE framework developed by Arup and Ellen MacArthur Foundation consists of Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop, Virtualise and Exchange to support circularity in the built environment. Not just the building materials themselves and advanced techniques of construction, but also new business models are required so that the socioeconomic system may also support circularity approaches. Increased digitalisation also supports the adoption of circular opportunities. Emerging economies globally need to consider circular approaches to meet the current and future demands of climate change mitigation and adaptation."

"Feminism, masculinity politics and the human services Young; Sex Education; Sexuality Feminists in the human services have drawn attention to the prevalence of sexist attitudes and practices in social welfare and, female human service workers have developed interventions and policies aimed at overcoming sexism. The contemporary male radical social work literature neglects analyses of masculinity and practice with men. There are a variety of ways of classifying the menâ€™s movement. The chapter identifies four distinct approaches: menâ€™s rights, mythopoetics, menâ€™s liberation and pro-feminism. These four trends have been the source of considerable conflict in menâ€™s politics from its beginning. A key argument of the menâ€™s rights movement is that men are unfairly blamed by women and feminism. The emphasis of much of the menâ€™s rightsâ€™ response to feminism is that women are equally responsible for the problems in the world and the issues confronting them. Profeminism for men involves a sense of responsibility to our own and other menâ€™s sexism, and a commitment to work with women to end menâ€™s violence."

"Strategic information sharing in supply chain with value-perceived consumers Bullwhip Effect; Information Dissemination; Supply Chain Performance Purpose: Information sharing is one of essential collaboration methods for building effective system-level disruption responses and communication for supply chain resilience. However, supply chain members are often reluctant to share the members' business information for fear of losing competitiveness. To facilitate the cooperation among these members, the supply chain members' should be made aware of the value of information. As a result, the purpose of this paper is to quantify the benefit of information sharing and evaluate its magnitude under various factors. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, information sharing is measured in a two-stage supply chain containing a manufacturer and a retailer. A demand function is constructed as a linear combination of a first-order autoregressive [AR(1)] process, the retail and reference prices. The values of information sharing are quantified for four scenarios: (1) no information sharing, (2) full information sharing, (3) limited information sharing and (4) partial information sharing. Based on the four scenarios, the conditions for valuable information sharing are determined. In addition, the impact of several demand parameters on the usefulness of information sharing is analyzed. Findings: When the demand function is a pure AR(1) process (i.e. there is no impact from the retail and reference prices), information sharing is always valuable regardless of the autoregressive coefficient. Under the influence of the retail price and consumer behavior via the reference price, information sharing is not always beneficial. The boundaries for useful information sharing are analytically constructed. In addition to full information sharing, this study also quantifies the value of information under a partial sharing scheme. The results indicate that the information is more valuable as long as the information is inducible. Originality/value: This study highlights several specific conditions for a beneficial information sharing agreement in consideration of consumer behaviors. These conditions enable supply chain members to design a sustainable partnership."

"Spatial differentiation of non-grain production on cultivated land and its driving factors in coastal China Sleuths; Cellular Automaton Model; Urbanization The rapid development of urbanization and industrialization in coastal China in the past 20 years has exerted a huge squeezing effect on agricultural land use. The phenomenon of non-grain production on cultivated land (NGP) is very common, seriously threatening the protection of high-quality arable land and national food security. In order to find out the overall situation regarding NGP on cultivated land in coastal China, this study revealed the spatial differentiation of NGP and its main driving factors by spatial autocorrelation analysis, multiple linear regression models and geographically weighted regression analysis (GWR). The results show that: (1) in 2018, the non-grain cultivated land area of 11 provinces along the coast of China was about 15.82 Ã— 106 hm2, accounting for 33.65% of the total cultivated land area. (2) The NGP rate in 11 provinces gradually decreased from south to north, but the NGP area showed two peak centers in Guangxi province and Shandong province, then decreased gradually outwards. (3) The low economic benefit of the planting industry (per capita GDP and urban-to-rural disposable income ratio) was the most important driving force, leading to the spatial differentiation of NGP, while the number of rural laborers and land transfer areas also acted as the main driving factors for the spatial differentiation of NGP. However, the influence of each driving factor has obvious spatial heterogeneity. The non-grained area and the non-grain production rate at the municipal level were completely different from those at the provincial level, and the spatial heterogeneity was more prominent. In the future, the local government should control the disorganized spread of NGP, scientifically set the bottom line of NGP, reduce the external pressure of NGP, regulate multi-party land transfer behavior, and strengthen land-use responsibilities. This study can provide a scientific foundation for adjusting land-use planning and cultivated land protection policies in China and other developing countries."
"A discursive–institutional perspective on transformative governance: A case from a fire management policy sector Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Scholarship around questions of climate change adaptation is increasingly concerned with ideas of transformative adaptation and its governance through critical re-evaluation of beliefs, values and associated institutions. For public policy sectors, the concept of transformative governance brings attention to their capacities for supporting and engaging in such governance. While much adaptation research and practice informs technical and structural understandings of these capacities (e.g., governance arrangements, learning systems and adaptation planning), most of this research (and practice) has ignored less formal, yet equally important dimensions of public administration and governance. Institutional scholarship highlights that dominant norms, beliefs, and philosophical ideas underpin how policy sectors structure their policy responses and engagement in governance. Discursive Institutionalism suggests that examining a sector's dominant discourse can provide insights into these â€œinstitutional logicsâ€. This paper therefore argues that understanding a policy sector's institutional logics is a crucial part of working toward enabling transformative governance of adaptation. This argument is developed through a case study of the institutional logics operating in the fire management policy sector of Victoria, Australia, and the potential influence of these logics on that sector's capacities to engage in transformative governance. Findings suggest this sector's institutional logics may currently constrain its capacities to engage in transformative governance and highlight the need for greater attention to socioinstitutional dimensions of public administration to help catalyze transformative governance of (and for) adaptation."

"Climate resilient land governance in the global south Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Processes of urbanisation and climate change, compounded by development deficits and issues of restricted access to land, resources and shelter, are combining to undermine individual and community resilience in the Global South. This chapter, based on an international review and analysis of five case studies in the Global South, investigates the complex inter-relationships between security of land tenure and climate vulnerability and how these linkages potentially impact the viability of climate and environmental planning. Findings from the study confirmed that insecure land tenure not only increases the exposure and sensitivity of marginalised communities to climate-related hazards but in many instances also adversely affects collective and individual capacities to adapt. To more effectively respond to these contemporary land and climate challenges, the chapter advocates for a more integrated approach â€“ Climate Resilient Land Governance â€“ to addressing complex resilience challenges."

"Locus of control and the mental health effects of local area crime Subjective Well-Being; Happiness; Life Satisfaction Rationale: Exposure to local crime can constitute profound and continuing trauma with significant mental health implications. This is true for both victims and others within society who have not been directly victimised. Yet, for most policymakers, understanding what can be done to help victims to improve their level of mental wellbeing, has proved to be extremely challenging. Objective: Our objective is to explore the role of locus of control (LoC), an important personality trait, in helping victims to develop resilience against crime. Specifically, we seek to examine the impact of local area crime rates on the mental health of residents and whether a person's LoC can help build resilience against the negative mental health effects from local area crime. Methods: Using 19 waves of longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, covering 15,245 adults between the ages of 21 and 59 years, we employ an empirical strategy that addresses the issue of sorting and endogenous crime-related moving behaviour. Results: We find that local area crime lowers mental health for residents, and that those who are more internal on LoC are more resilient to the adverse effects of local crime on mental health. Our results also show that social capital, physical activity, perceived safety and neighbourhood satisfaction are mechanisms through which LoC moderates the effect of local crime on mental health. Conclusion: Our findings have important implications for developing policies that seek to address the negative effects of crime. We propose policies that promote building safer communities and fostering social inclusion as ways to reduce the effect of crime on mental health."

"“Indiscipline” in context: a political-economic grounding for dangerous driving behaviors among Tro-Tro drivers in Ghana Traffic Behavior; Aggressive Driving; Anger This paper attempts a better explanation for the causes of dangerous driving behaviors among â€œTro-Troâ€(minibus) drivers in Ghana. The current media, policy, and academic coverage of the problem reveals an immutable discourse that considers the behaviors (such as over speeding) as a function of moral failure, indiscipline, or bad attitudes on the part of the drivers. Often little consideration is given to the context of the behaviors and their influences. This paper provides an alternative explanation that considers the behaviors as predictable actions that are systematically connected to the Tro-Tro industry. Tro-Tro drivers operate within a precarious work climate marked by problems such as low wages; cut-throat competition; high level of job insecurity; imposition of non-negotiable throat-cutting daily fees by car owners and harassments from bribe-demanding corrupt police officers. The exigencies of meeting these numerous financial and other demands of their work, not moral failure, are what fuel dangerous driving behaviors among the drivers. Based on this analysis, the present public policy of using penal populism (i.e., heavy fines and prison sentences) to address road trauma in Ghana is ineffective for inducing safer driving behaviors among Tro-Tro drivers. Interventions to reduce road transport problems involving such commercial passenger vehicles in Ghana and other developing countries similarly situated must be broad, more-wider reaching and include initiatives that also address the range of political-economic causes, motivations, and constraints that incentivize the drivers to drive dangerously. The paper contributes to the sustainable development goals of ensuring safe and sustainable transport (SDG 11.2), and reducing deaths and injuries from road accidents (SDG 3.6)."

"Leading well is not enough: A new insight from the ethical leadership, workplace bullying and employee well-being relationships Mobbing; Incivility; Nurses Purpose: While research on the influence of ethical and unethical behaviour on employee well-being abound, we still know little of how well-being is shaped under the dual positive and negative behavioural influences in the workplace. To address this limitation, this paper aims to investigate the relative effects of ethical behaviour of leadership and unethical bullying behaviour on employee well-being through the application of the conservation of resources theory. Design/methodology/approach: This study was conducted in the context of Pakistan by seeking views of 330 employees in academic work settings. Findings: The data analysis revealed that occurrence of unethical behaviour plays a more potent role than ethical behaviour in shaping employee well-being. These findings lend support to the conservation of resources theoretical perspective by reiterating the salience of resource loss over resource gain in shaping employee well-being. Originality/value: This study offers a new insight into the management literature by highlighting that combating workplace bullying not only conserves employee well-being, but also allows organisations to capitalise more fully on the positive process enabled by leadership."

"The economic dynamics and population change of Australia’s regional cities Regional Development; Leadership; Governance Arrangement Key points This analysis is based on data from the 2011 and 2016 censuses, and does not take into account the redistributions and changes that may have occurred with COVID-19. This report can be seen as providing a baseline for subsequent analysis of the changes that have occurred and continue to occur, identifying the trends and conditions across regional Australiaâ€™s urban centres prior to 2020. Populations in regional urban centres are growing overallâ€”however, this growth is differentiated. Regional urban centre population growth is associated with proximity to major cities, and to coastal locations. Regional urban centre population decline is associated with remoteness and exposure to the resource economy. Capital cities are the main source of migration to regional urban centres, principally coastal and satellite centres with regional-to-regional-centre migration highly self-contained. International migration follows similar distribution. Commuting between regional centres and proximate capital cities increased over 2011â€“2016, indicating increased peri-metropolitan dependency on metropolitan interactions. Employment growth is associated with population growth, particularly for the larger metropolitan satellite and coastal regional citiesâ€”however, this is also associated with lower wage growth due to the employment mix. Health, community service, construction, hospitality and accommodation increased their share of regional employment. Industries associated with agglomeration economies are concentrating in fewer urban centres, while those associated with population services are becoming more dispersed. National economic growth factors appear to expert greater influence on employment growth in regional urban centres, while industry factors exert very limited influence. Regional effects exert greater influence than industry effects, although these are unevenly distributed. In 135 of 198 cases, a regional urban centre exhibits employment growth along with its surrounding functional economic region. For 33 regional urban centres there is positive divergence, while for 25 there is negative divergence. Four regional urban centres are declining within a declining functional economic region. Factors associated with stronger employment growth include employment factors, industry factors (especially those dependent on population growth), while income growth was less associated with employment growth. Population change exerted a strong influence on employment growth, as did human capital factors. Housing market (i.e. price) growth is strongly associated with population growth, while locational factors exhibited low associations. Cluster analysis identified nine distinctive regional urban centre groups: metro-satellites; large regional cities; medium growth cities; regional service centres; ageing population centres; agricultural centres; mining centres; industrial centres, and northern Queensland centres. Policy development should consider the following: Policy and planning measures to address the phenomenon of growth in metropolitan satellite regional urban centres, and the need to ensure coherent population, housing and employment distribution and linkages. Coordinated economic and social development approaches to emerging low-income service economies in coastal regional urban centres. Long-term transition planning to address resource-dependent regional urban centres facing cyclical economic changes based on the labour intensity of construction relative to ongoing economic activity. Opportunities and mechanisms to leverage high-wage economic development from existing regional city industry clusters. Opportunities and mechanisms for regional spatial coordination of fiscal policy to optimise development of high-wage employment in suitable regional urban centres. The study Purpose The contribution of regional urban centres to Australiaâ€™s economic and population growth has been a topic of growing policy interest in the past two decades, as a result of rapid growth in the major cities and concerns for parts of regional Australia that have experienced population decline. Associated with these trends is the distribution of economic activity and employmentâ€”particularly as traditional regional strengths such as agriculture, manufacturing and mining have declined as sources of employment in recent decades. Over the same period, metropolitan areas have prospered because of concentrations of high-skill, high-wage knowledge work, indicating diverging regional fortunes as a result of wider economic trends. The purpose of this research is to investigate patterns and dynamics of population, migration and economic change in Australian regional urban centres 2011â€“2016. The research is principally an empirically focused investigation identifying patterns and dynamic processes of regional change using advanced spatial analytical techniques, but provides an information base that will support future policy development efforts. Inquiry This research is part of a wider AHURI Inquiry into population growth in Australiaâ€™s smaller cities. The Inquiry asks two overarching questions: First, what is the capacity of Australiaâ€™s smaller cities to assist in managing national population growth, including international and national migration? Second, which policy instruments and programs are most likely to redirect population movements to these locations? Study This research investigates two overarching questions related to the Inquiry: How can we differentiate Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres according to economic profile, population trajectory, industry structure and geography? What are the current mobility and settlement patterns of migrants, including those arriving from other parts of Australia and from other nations, across these smaller cities? Three further research questions are posed by this project: 1. How can a typology of smaller cities assist to understand their role in regional, state and national economies? 2. How are Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres differentiated in terms of economic profile, population trajectory and industry structure? 3. What demographic, economic and spatial factors are associated with economic and population growth, and what attributes are associated with better economic performance of regional urban centres? Approach and methods For Research question 1: the project undertakes longitudinal measures of social, demographic and industry change in regional cities 2011â€“2016 using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census data. Next, flow analysis and mapping of migration is applied to identify key migration patterns. Migration flows are used to construct migration regions via modularity analysis. Similar techniques are used to identify journey to work flows from which functional economic regions are constructed. Shift share of employment change and location quotient analysis of employment is used to understand economic change and industry structure. For Research question 2, to understand how Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres are differentiated the project applies hierarchical cluster and discriminant analysis to construct a typology of regional urban centres. This is based on a combination of economic, demographic and geographic factors. These are compiled into summary data and descriptive explanations. For Research question 3: the study applies structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify the relationships between economic, social and demographic factors affecting population change and economic growth in regional urban centres. Key findings Differentiating Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres are heterogeneous in terms of size, location within the Australian continent and settlement structures, level of employment, industrial mix and degree of interaction with regional, metropolitan, national and international economic processes and dynamics. In 2016, there were 198 Australian regional urban centres that had populations greater than 5,000 residents. Most are experiencing population growth. However this growth is differentiated across a range of factors, including: the existing size of the centre location relative to the coast location relative to an existing major capital city. A small number of regional urban centres are experiencing population decline. These centres are largely associated with the resource economy. They are typically positioned in remote locations in Australia. Migration Migration is a major factor in population change within regional urban centres. Migration patterns are clearly structured at the regional scale, with distinct geographies of intra-regional movement that include discernible levels of self-containment. There is a sizeable phenomenon of major city to regional urban centre migration, especially in the south-east of Australia. Beyond the major metropolitan zones, there are larger internally connected migration regions, which often involving movement between adjacent regional urban centres. Some regional urban centres lose and receive populations across long distances. For example, the Northern Territory (NT) operates as a single migration region, partly because of its relatively small population and large scaleâ€”although the volumes of movement are relatively small."

"Energy poverty and public health: Global evidence Energy; Energy Poverty; Fuelwood The impacts of energy poverty on a range of development goals have been widely examined in the literature; however, how energy poverty affects public health has yet to be studied. Using annual data for a broad panel of 175 countries over the period 2000 to 2018, this paper investigates the effect of energy poverty on public health. To identify the causal effect of energy poverty on public health and tackle the issue of endogeneity, we rely on Oster's (2019) bound analysis and the system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation. Our results show that energy poverty has a detrimental effect on public health. We also find that living standards can serve as a channel through which energy poverty influences health, and that countries with higher standards of living weaken the negative effect of energy poverty on public health. Our results are robust across various specifications and measures of health indicators. Our findings have important implications for policies in public health and transitions to renewable energy."
"Disposal and recycle economic assessment for aircraft and engine end of life solution evaluation Planning; Disassembly; Design For Assembly The present study proposes an economic indicator to support the evaluation of aircraft End of Life (EoL) strategies in view of the increasing demand with regards to aircraft decommissioning. This indicator can be used to evaluate the economic performance and to facilitate the trade-off studies among different strategies. First, Disposal and Recycle (D&R) scenarios related to stakeholders are investigated to identify the core concepts for the economic evaluation. Next, we extracted the aircraft D&R process from various real-life practices. In order to obtain the economic measure for the engineering process, a method of estimating the D&R cost and values are developed by integrating product, process and cost properties. This analysis is demonstrated on an averaged data set and two EoL aircraft cases. In addition, sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of the D&R cost, residual value, and salvage value. Results show that the disassembly and dismantling of an aircraft engine possesses relatively more economic gains than that for the aircraft. The main factors influencing the proposed D&R economic indicator are the salvage value and D&R cost for economically efficient D&R cases. In addition, delaying the disposal and recycle process for EoL aircraft can lead to economically unfavorable solutions. The economic indicator combined with the evaluation methods is widely applicable for evaluations of engineering products EoL solutions, and implies a significant contribution of this research to decision making for such complex systems in terms sustainable policy."
"Removing PFAS from aquatic systems using natural and renewable material-based adsorbents: A review Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have caused widespread pollution of water environments as they are highly persistent in aqueous media, toxic and bioaccumulative. Adsorption processes have been proven effective for separating PFAS from various types of contaminated water. While activated carbon technology is the most extensively used method for removing PFAS from water and wastewater at commercial scales, it is limited by lower efficiency for removing short-chain PFAS compounds, competitive adsorption of other organics, use of the non-renewable source of materials, and the requirement for energy-intensive thermal regeneration. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing alternative adsorbents that originate from abundant renewable natural sources or other low-cost sources such as solid wastes to address these issues. However, it is a lack of a holistic understanding of the efficacy of these non-conventional adsorbents, particularly the effects of their physical and chemical characteristics on PFAS adsorption capacities. This review is focused on the recent advancements in a range of emerging adsorbents, with a view to critically evaluating their potential as environmentally friendly and more efficient alternatives to conventional activated carbon products for PFAS separation from the contaminated water. The adsorption behavior of the different natural and renewable material-based adsorbents for PFAS are compared, and the underlying removal mechanisms are discussed. Their practicality in terms of treatment of real water/wastewater, reusability, and continuous operation is also examined.

"Investigating heritage sites through the lens of social media Social Media; Online Reviews; Brand Community Today, our understanding and experience of heritage sites have been reframed by the advent of social media and the ubiquitous use of smartphones that offer more participatory ways of interacting with heritage. The lifespan of a heritage site is highly concerned with how it is understood and experienced by visitors. This study aims to investigate a heritage site and its participatory culture through the lens of social media and and to understand how a certain heritage site could be understood by these online networks. The historic city of Shiraz packed with several monumental buildings and heritage sites has been chosen as the case study of this research. Three social media platforms of Flickr, 500px and Instagram were investigated during 2015 and their photos of Shiraz were downloaded for analysis. The analysis of more than 186 images from these websites has provided an opportunity to investigate how the historical district of Shiraz is remembered in the eyes of social media users. Based on the initial photo audits, Nasir-al-Molk Mosque with more than 74 published images was the most published building and therefore was selected for an in-depth photo survey analysis. The Nasir-al-Molk Mosque images were studied regarding the physical and spiritual qualities of its building and how they contribute to its popularity among social media photographers."

"A roadmap for systematically identifying opportunities in ecosystems using scientific publications data Technology Roadmapping; Data Mining; Technological Competitiveness Opportunity identification is a continuous process in ecosystems. However, ambiguities and challenges associated with knowledge exploration and exploitation can retard opportunity recognition processes. This in turn may culminate in excessive expenditure of resources or loss of latent opportunities. The present study adopts an analytical approach and proposes a methodological roadmap that utilizes scientometric and text mining techniques. The roadmap uses data from Web of Science as input, and generates insights that support decision-making about resource saving, strategic planning, investment, and policymaking. Our roadmap extends methods used in studying ecosystems by combining existing and novel techniques in data analytics. Using Python and VOSViewer, we show an exemplary application of the new roadmap, framed in the context of the Nordic countries' renewable energy ecosystem."

"Novel bioremediation tools for nitrogen contaminated groundwater Groundwater contamination with nitrogen (nitrates, ammonia and organic nitrogen) is a global issue reducing the
quality of groundwater and restricting its use (WHO, 2011). The current standard approaches for nitrogen remediation
of groundwater are costly and invasive with water being brought to the surface and treated ex situ before replacement
in the aquifer.

The proposed project will investigate augmenting natural attenuation and bioremediating nitrogen contaminated
groundwater in situ. The research has three modules:

Module 1: Assess why current natural attention in selected aquifers is ineffective over 2 years.

Module 2: Use RMIT mesocosms to test the effects of carbon sources and concentrations, indigenous vs. added
microbes to environmental variables ( pH, salinity) to improve bioremediation.

Module 3: Test the preferred approaches from 1 and 2 on in situ aquifers impacted by the water industry in year 3."

"Researching and Codesigning the Early Childhood Early Intervention (ECEI) Support There are various challenges currently being experienced by families and practitioners in the implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme’s (NDIS), Early Childhood Early Intervention (ECEI) program for young children with a developmental delay or disability, and their families. In particular, two areas of potential improvement in the ECEI service delivery have been identified as essential if to improve the experiences and overcome the challenges. The following key questions have been identified:
1. How are the assessment of support needs and goal-setting procedures with families currently conducted?
2. How might we co-imagine better ways to provide these services at Brotherhood of St. Laurence?
To address these issues, the Brotherhood of St Laurence (The Organisation) has commenced a participatory design research project (Co-designing ECEI project) and invited RMIT’s, Dr. Jaz Hee-jeong Choi, to be a partner in conducting this research and investigation to ascertain what is required.
The Research Services to be undertaken in completion of this agreement are part of a larger project. The purpose of the larger project is to address the challenges faced by families and practitioners working in the NDIS ECEI service."

"Experiences of police apprehension for psychosocial disability: a co-designed investigation Police callouts for psychosocial distress occur every 12 minutes. More than 6% of all people taken to hospital for psychosocial distress are taken by police, by force.  This is ten times higher than for physical health issues. Cases of poor practice highlight the disabling potential of police responses,  yet the academic literature shows that this does not have to be the case. 
Many people with psychosocial disability find police apprehension stigmatising, distressing and traumatic, despite reform initiatives. Not all people who experience psychosocial distress will experience or be labelled with psychosocial disability, but many will find police responses disabling. 
This project takes a human rights and co-production approach, informed by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), to bring the voices of people with psychosocial disability into this discussion and  influence policing and other crisis response practices. Our team is led by people with psychosocial disability, including two people with experience of police apprehension in the context of psychosocial distress, supported by academics with expertise in co-production, mental health and policing. There are no other Australian studies which use a co-produced approach on this topic, despite ongoing reforms and shifts in policy and practice responses.

"Decision support for wildfire asset protection: A two-stage stochastic programming approach Time Windows; Travelling Salesman Problems; Genetic Algorithm During uncontrollable wildfires, decision-makers dispatch vehicles for tasks aimed at reducing the hazard to key assets. The decision-making process is complicated by the need for vehicle capabilities to match asset requirements within time windows determined by the progression of the fire. This is often further complicated by a wind change that is expected but with uncertainty in the timing. This paper aims to provide a decision support approach for determining plans for the deployment of resources under various scenarios. To this end, we solve the Asset Protection Problem (APP) in the context of Australia's Black Saturday bushfires by developing a two-stage stochastic model. In this problem, we consider uncertainties in the timing of a change in wind velocity in defining various scenarios. We present a dynamic rerouting model and an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) algorithm to solve the model in a time efficient manner for decision-makers. A new set of instances were generated using realistic parameters. Thereafter, we evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches through extensive computational experiments. We solve both the two-stage stochastic program and the more limited dynamic rerouting model exactly for small instances. We observe that the restrictions of the dynamic rerouting model yields solutions within a few percent of the two-stage stochastic program. Moreover, the ALNS solution is a good approximation to its exact equivalent but with faster solution times. After further tests, it became apparent that with larger asset numbers the ALNS is the more practical method for operational purposes."

"Improvement of log reduction values design equations for helminth egg management in recycled water Ascaris; Pathogens; Helminths Understanding and managing the risk posed by helminth eggs (HE) is a key concern for wastewater engineers and public health regulators. The treatment processes that produce recycled water from sewage at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) rely on achieving a defined log10 reduction value (LRV) in HE concentration during the production of recycled water from sewage to achieve the guideline concentration of â‰¤1.0 HE/L. The total concentration of HE in sewage reaches thousands of HE/L in developing countries and therefore, an LRV of 4.0 is generally accepted to achieve a safe concentration in recycled water, as this will meet the guideline value. However, in many developed countries with good sanitation and public health standards, the HE concentration in sewage is generally <10 HE/L. Therefore, validation of the sewage treatment process relied on to achieve an LRV of 4.0 can be difficult. Because of these limitations, design equations to predict LRVs from hydraulic retention times (HRT), which are geographically non-specific, are commonly relied on to ensure the production of safe quality recycled water with respect to HE. However, these design equations could be further refined by defining the design and management of the treatment process in greater detail and thus be used more effectively for determining the LRV required. This paper discusses the limitations and possible improvements that could be applied to LRV design equations for predicting HE removal at WWTPs and identifies the data requirements to support these improvements. Several options for LRV design equations are proposed that could be validated experimentally or via the ongoing operation of WWTPs. These improvements have the potential to assist the rationalization of the HE removal requirements for specific treatment options, exposure scenarios and use of recycled water in agriculture."

"Emergenc(i)es of the crisis: Anti-heroic figures of youth entrepreneurship in Spain Labour Market; Atypical Employment; Active Labour Market Policy The aim of this article is to understand the key elements of the entrepreneurship as a governmental program reactivated during the last economic crisis and to tackle the effects that it is generating on Spanish youths. European and Spanish entrepreneurship policies have emerged as an emergency solution to the high unemployment and job insecurity experienced by young people. Our hypothesis is that they are having controversial and paradoxical effects on the subjectification processes of young people. From this departure point, the concept of â€œgrammar of entrepreneurshipâ€ is proposed to account for how agents from different fields â€”political, educational, financial, media â€” summon a morality, a mood disposition and a type of entrepreneurial subjectivity that, given the present socio-economic situation, is paradoxical, if not unachievable. Based on a qualitative fieldwork centred on the experiences and narratives of young people involved in entrepreneurship, some analytical figures that point out to those limits and impossibilities are reviewed and contrasted. Among them, those which condense the discomforts and contradictions produced by the grammar of the entrepreneurship such as emperdedor, emprendeudor o emprecario (combination of words linking entrepreneurship with loss, debt and precariousness respectively)."

"Treatment of mature landfill leachate in tropical climate using membrane bioreactors with different configurations Landfill Leachates; Leaching; Municipal Solid Waste This study describes the collection of landfill leachate from seven sites in different climatic zones of Sri Lanka and characterizes the landfills through the analyses of leachate quality. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) with different configurations were employed to treat some of those leachates. An aerobic MBR (AMBR) system was operated in three Phases. In the first Phase, an AMBR alone, in the second Phase an anaerobic reactor followed by an anoxic reactor and an AMBR and in the third Phase an anoxic reactor followed by an AMBR were operated. In Phases I and II, the sludge retention time (SRT) and the hydraulic retention time (HRT) were kept at infinite (as no intentional wasting of sludge was made) and 96 h; in Phase III, the SRT was varied from 60, 30, 20 to 10 days and under each SRT, the HRT was varied from 96, 48, 24 and 12 h. The optimum operating conditions for the configuration used in Phase III was established through extensive experiments which had a SRT. The three MBR configurations removed more than 93%, 64.8% and 59% of BOD5, COD and total nitrogen respectively. They also removed large amounts of slowly biodegradable substances and nitrogenous compounds other than NH4+, NO3âˆ’ and NO2âˆ’. Relationships between SRT and MLSS as well as SRT and fouling rate of membrane have been found. The study illustrates the capabilities of MBR in treating landfill leachate."

"Code-switching Identities: curating networked presence Non-binary gender identities pose a problem for international provision of education, health services and citizenship, and yet gender-diverse stories proliferate in a multitude of online spaces and are increasingly visible in mainstream media. Could the co-incidence of new ‘beyond-dualistic’ ways of being neither wholly male/female and online/offline, spell an end to finite and binary ways of being and doing gender? 

This project examines the intersections between emergent gender categories and fluid, multiple digital identities. It engages discrete groups of young gender-diverse people, their parents, educators, health providers and policy makers, in short creative workshops, where they each produce a pseudonymous, ‘ungendered’ selfie. These fragments of self will be curated in an online archive/website and exhibition at RMIT. Their images and reflections will be used as prompts at a Symposium in which we unpack the many ways we may like to be categorised and archived in more formal institutions of governance, education and citizenship.

"Community treatment orders: towards a new research agenda Community Treatment Orders; Psychiatry; Health Act Objectives: The aim of this study was to report on a half-day multi-stakeholder symposium on community treatment orders (CTOs) hosted by the Melbourne Social Equity Institute (MSEI), which identified research gaps and opportunities, and produced an agreed agenda for future CTO research. Methods: The MSEI convened a symposium for 22 experts in CTO research to discuss research priorities in this field in Australasia. An independent moderator elicited views and recommendations and produced a report detailing possible research projects. Results: Research on CTOs is contentious and there is a need to gather and examine information regarding both their use and utility. Due to the complexities involved, it was agreed that research should be undertaken in partnership with persons with had lived experience of mental health problems, clinicians, policymakers and other interdisciplinary stakeholders. Five key areas for future investigation were identified. Conclusions: The issues and recommendations arising from the symposium should shape the scope, nature and conduct of future research directions in the field."

"RNA sequencing of leaf tissues from two contrasting chickpea genotypes reveals mechanisms for drought tolerance Cicer; Ascochyta; Genetic Variability Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the second most important winter crop which is consumed globally due to its high nutritional value. Chickpea as one of the leguminous crop is important in crop rotation with cereal crops like wheat and barley. The main constraints for chickpea production are abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and heat. Among these, drought is a major cause of the decline in chickpea production in worldwide. Studies conducted so far have provided a limited insight into different genetic pathways associated with drought tolerance/response. In this study, the leaf tissue from shoots apical meristem stage of drought tolerant (ICC8261) and drought sensitive (ICC283) genotypes were analysed using RNA sequencing to identify genes/pathways associated with drought tolerance/sensitivity in both genotypes. It was observed that genes related to ethylene response, MYB-related protein, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, alkane hydroxylase MAH-like, BON-1 associated, peroxidase 3, cysteine-rich and transmembrane domain, vignain and mitochondrial uncoupling were specifically up-regulated in the tolerant genotype whereas, same genes were down-regulated in sensitive genotype. The crosstalk between the different hormones and transcriptional factors involved in drought tolerance and sensitivity in both genotypes make them great candidates for future research."
"Potential of Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis salina for nutrient and organic matter removal from municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) poses health and environmental risks on its disposal as it contains nutrients and harmful organic compounds at elevated concentrations. This study compared a freshwater microalga Chlorella vulgaris and a marine microalga Nannochloropsis salina in suspended and alginate-immobilised cultures for batch and semi-continuous treatment of the ROC. The immobilised algae gave comparable nutrient removal rates to the suspended cells, demonstrating immobilisation had no apparent negative impact on the photosynthetic activity of microalgae. Semi-continuous algal treatment illustrated that the microalgae could remove significant amounts of nutrients (> 50% and > 80% for TN and TP, respectively), predominantly through algal uptake (> 90%), within a short period (48 h) and generate 335â€“360 mg DCW L-1 d-1 of algal biomass. The treatment also removed a significant amount of organic matter (12.7â€“13.3 mg DOC L-1 d-1), primarily (> 65%) through the biotic pathway."

"Freeway Traffic Safety Evaluation Using Virtual Reality: Focus on Compound Curve Driving Simulator; Stopping Distance; Curve The traditional method of designing freeway geometric characteristics may not well consider traffic safety and evaluation problems associated with vehicle, driver, road, and environmental features. This paper looks into accident-prone compound curves and puts forward a traffic safety evaluation method that can comprehensively assess various influencing factors. This method integrates driving simulation and Virtual Reality (VR) technology. Methodically, this paper first used three-dimensional (3D) design software to build the digital model and spatial scene model of the compound curves from the aspects of geometric structure, spatial characteristics, terrain information, and so on. Next, drivers were invited to conduct a series of driving simulation experiments upon the humanâ€“computer interaction safety experience platform, and driver physiological data and vehicle driving information collected. Last but not least, the mean values of heart rate changes, steering wheel angle changes, and driving trajectory changes were derived to synthesise the comprehensive traffic safety evaluation framework. Based on the analysis of the results of the orthogonal test, select the road plane design indicators that have a significant impact on the traffic safety evaluation, and carry out regression analysis. The research shows that the novel traffic safety evaluation method integrating with VR technology can comprehensively consider various influencing factors, and designers can dynamically adjust the design metrics according to the traffic safety level."
"Factors affecting the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices: Findings from panel data for Vietnam Agriculture; Indo-Gangetic Plain; Tillage Conventional farming and climate change are placing considerable stress on agricultural systems around the world, leading to increased hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, particularly in developing countries. Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) can help raise productivity and agricultural incomes while minimising negative environmental impacts. While recognising that sustainability is a contested term, we identify agricultural practices that are generally viewed as sustainable as they minimise impacts on the environment. Despite the benefits of SAPs, adoption rates are still low in developing countries. While previous studies have examined the factors affecting SAP adoption, most have not accounted for issues of heterogeneity and endogeneity inherent in such analysis. In this paper, we address this by employing a random-effects probit model with the Mundlak approach and fixed-effects linear probability models to control for farmer- and plot-level heterogeneities and to avoid the incidental parameters problem. We analyse panel data from Vietnam for approximately 14,000 plots over the period 2008â€“2016 to identify the factors behind SAP adoption. Overall, we find that improved knowledge transferred by extension agents and learning from peers significantly influence adoption. Farmers' knowledge of their land and soil quality are also important factors. We recommend enhancing cooperation between extension agents, farmer groups and peers in order to encourage SAP adoption."

"Strength and microstructural study of recycled asphalt pavement: Slag geopolymer as a pavement base material Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali The integrated transdisciplinary concepts and technologies for greener and more sustainable innovations for recycling waste materials through geopolymer technique into construction materials were developed in this research. The objective of this research was to study the strength and microstructural development of slag (S)-based geopolymer-stabilized recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) as a pavement base material. An attempt was made to study the influence of a liquid alkaline activator (L = NaOH=Na2SiO3 ratio) on the strength development of RAP-S geopolymers, which was evaluated by an unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test and examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. The XRD and SEM analyses results indicated that the main geopolymerization reaction product of RAP-S geopolymers was calcium alumino-silicate hydrate (C-A-S-H). Without Na2SiO3 (L = NaOH=Na2SiO3 = 100:0), the S-geopolymer exhibited a slow geopolymerization reaction. The silica presented in Na2SiO3 was highly soluble; hence, a suitable content of NaOH=Na2SiO3 = 60:40 can produce RAP+20%S geopolymers as a base material whose 7-day UCS value met the minimum strength requirements specified by the Department of Highways, Thailand. However, when excess Na2SiO3 content (NaOH=Na2SiO3 = 50:50) was used, the presence of silica retarded the geopolymerization formation rate, leading to UCS reduction. The outcomes of this research were found to be useful for making progress in innovative technologies and applications of geopolymers, which strongly reflected the improvements made in the practical applications of the S-geopolymer as a cleaner production by using the recycled waste material in road work."
"Trends in Urban Forestry Research in Latin America & The Caribbean: A Systematic Literature Review and Synthesis Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Research on urban forests has expanded in the last 30 years in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Nonetheless, urban forestry has been explored to much less extent in the Latin America and the Caribbean region, despite being one of the most urbanized and biodiverse regions in the world. We address this gap by providing a baseline understanding of urban forest research in the region based on a systematic review of the academic literature. Of the 55,000 studies found, 195 were selected for review, and 182 were analysed and synthesized. These studies came from 13 countries and were published from 1970 to mid-2018 (inclusive) in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Almost half of the studies were based in Brazil, followed by Mexico and Chile. To comparatively assess article output by country, we accounted for country population and Brazil, Chile, Nicaragua, and Puerto Rico had higher than average per capita article output. Most articles were ecological studies (64%) that used field surveys (58%) to research urban vegetation diversity. Most ecological studies did not include any social or management considerations. Only a few studies focused on spatiotemporal dynamics (12%) or the direct opinions of stakeholders (9%). We observed a notable increase in article output from the region during the last decade. The units of analysis targeted by these studies mostly focused on single trees in public areas (streets and parks). Understanding urban forests regionally could be strengthened by scaling up research across multiple units of analysis and across regional cities, which could provide a better understanding of regional spatiotemporal dynamics. To respond to current global trends and nurture regional strengths, research could also focus on a wider range of ecosystem services provided by urban forests, and the relationship of urban forests with poverty, crime, climate vulnerability, biodiversity loss, and social equity. These findings can inform key stakeholders in the region managing urban forests and trees about research trends and gaps to be filled. This article shows that the region indeed has an important body of research in urban forestry that should be recognized in global assessments."
"Sustainable water management and improved corporate reporting in mining Decision Making; Export Earnings; Mines The advent of corporate sustainability reporting and water accounting standards has resulted in increased disclosure of water use by mining companies. However, there has been limited compilation and analysis of these disclosures. To address this, we compiled a database of 8314 data points from 359 mining company reports, classified according to mining industry water accounting guidelines. The quality of disclosures is shown to have improved considerably over time. Although, opportunities still exist to improve reporting practices, such as by ensuring that all relevant water flows are reported and to explicitly state non-existent flows (e.g. discharges). Initial data analysis reveals considerable variability in water withdrawals, use efficiency and discharges between mining operations. Further work to improve industry coverage and to analyse the influence of mine specific factors such as ore processing methods and local climate will provide insights into the interactions of mining and water resources at a global scale."

"Eliminating HIV reservoirs for a cure: The issue is in the tissue Proviruses; Antiretroviral Therapy; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Purpose of review Advances in antiretroviral therapy have saved numerous lives, converting a diagnosis with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) from a death sentence into the possibility for a (nearly) normal life in many instances. However, the obligation for lifelong adherence, increased risk of accumulated comorbidities, and continued lack of uniform availability around the globe underscores the need for an HIV cure. Safe and scalable HIV cure strategies remain elusive, in large part due to the presence of viral reservoirs in which caches of infected cells remain hidden from immune elimination, primarily within tissues. Herein, we summarize some of the most exciting recent advances focused on understanding, quantifying, and ultimately targeting HIV tissue viral reservoirs. Recent findings Current studies have underscored the differences between viral reservoirs in tissue compartments as compared to peripheral blood, in particular, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Additionally, several novel or modified techniques are showing promise in targeting the latent viral reservoir, including modifications in drug delivery platforms and techniques such as CRISPR. Summary Elimination of tissue viral reservoirs is likely the key to generation of an effective HIV cure. Exciting studies have come out recently that reveal crucial insights into topics ranging from the basic biology of reservoir seeding to effective drug targeting. However, there are still many outstanding questions in the field about the relative importance of specific reservoirs, such as the GI tract, that may alter the final strategy pursued."

"Redressing gendered undervaluation in New Zealand aged care: Institutions, activism and coalitions Political Representation; Quotas; Parliament This article explores the apparent conundrum of how, with minimal employment standards and limited equal pay laws, New Zealand managed to significantly redress the gendered undervaluation of low-paid aged care work. To draw out the pathways to these reforms, we focus on the long-term strategic coalitions that underpinned them. We examine, in particular, the activism of a diverse range of policy actors â€“ unions, employers, industrial and human rights bodies and civil society groups, which together have worked to â€˜undoâ€™ the limitations of equal pay and employment regulation. Our findings point to the benefits of strategic collaboration between policy actors in New Zealand and an approach which recognises the intersection of unequal pay with other gendered dimensions of disadvantage in aged care work. Different strategies used over time by diverse actors helped them overcome inadequate industrial and equal pay infrastructure to realise meaningful increases in hourly rates of pay, buttressed by improved working time arrangements and provision for career progression. We conclude by highlighting some lessons for institutional and policy actors in other national settings drawn from the New Zealand collaborative approach to equal pay in care work."

"An Anthropocene species of trouble? Negative synergies between earth system change and geological destratification Anthropocene; Climate Change; Environment Crisis It is already well understood that unbinding materials and energy from their lithic reservoirs impacts upon Earth systems. But that is just the first stage of a cycle of â€˜Anthropocene troubleâ€™. This paper tracks the multiple ways in which subsequent Earth system change reacts back upon the social infrastructures of subsurface exploitation and the landscapes they produce. Shifting fire regimes, intensifying hydrometeorological events and sea level rise impact upon the infrastructures of hydrocarbon extraction, hydroclimatic change impacts upon infrastructures and landscapes of mineral extraction, and both pyroclimatic and hydroclimatic change impact upon nuclear infrastructures and on landscapes already contaminated by radioactive materials. To make sense of these â€˜negative synergiesâ€™ we draw upon social science diagnoses of late modern hazards as well Anthropocene scienceâ€™s deepening collaboration between â€˜hard rockâ€™ geology and Earth system science."

"Odour removal from scum Odorous emission from the wastewater treatment plant include both organic and inorganic gases and vapours. The anerobic decomposition of organic matter is mainly responsible to release gases that mostly contains H2S, NH3, CO2, and CH4. Among these, H2S and NH3 are strongly malodorous. In addition, compounds such as mercaptans and other organic sulphides and amines such as indole and skatole, which are highly malodorous are also present at lower concentration in the sludge. The monoaromatic compounds and aldehydes are also the main contributors for odour generation in the wastewater treatment plants. The odours originating from treatment plant is' nuisance to surrounding neighbourhood which requires to be controlled.
Currently different odour removal techniques are available out of which, chemical conditioning is the most cost-effective technique. The different chemical compounds used are mainly Iron salts, Bioxide, Oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide, Anthraquinone, lime, and NaHCO3. Among the different chemical compounds, lime is known as the most cost-effective chemical used for odour removal from

"Consumer’s Functional Values in Luxury Fashion Consumption: A Cross-cultural Comparison between Australia and China Luxury Brands; Counterfeit; Luxury Consumers use functional values to evaluate fashion products, which are influenced by an individualâ€™s nationality and cultural background. Although previous cross-cultural studies in luxury consumption determined the similarities and differences between Western and Asian consumers, there is scarce information on the influence of functional value perception between Australian and Chinese millennial consumers in their luxury handbag purchasing. In this study, a consumerâ€™s functional values were measured through three specific values: usability, quality, and uniqueness. Usability value refers to an individualâ€™s evaluation of a handbagâ€™s functions as satisfying their needs, such as size and ease of use. Quality value is a consumerâ€™s evaluation of a handbagâ€™s physical qualities, such as material quality, craftsmanship, and lifespan. Uniqueness value is a consumerâ€™s need to be unique or distinct from others, which is evaluated in terms of a handbagâ€™s exclusivity. 49 Australian and 52 Chinese millennial luxury-fashion-brand consumers were invited to a survey that required participants to do a pairwise comparison of the importance of these three values on their purchasing decision of a luxury fashion handbag. This pairwise comparison method and data analysis were based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which is a mathematically based, multi-objective, decision-making tool. The results demonstrate that quality value has the greatest impact on luxury fashion handbag purchasing decisions for both Australian and Chinese millennial consumers, while the uniqueness value has the lowest impact on former and the usability value on latter. This study may assist brands and product developers to better understand the influence of both Australian and Chinese consumersâ€™ functional values on their intention to purchase a luxury handbag from a cross-cultural perspective, helping to establish user-centered design criteria for developing luxury fashion handbags."
"Handling complexity in animal and plant science research—From single to functional traits: Are we there yet? Biomarkers; Hippuric Acid; Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy The current knowledge of the main factors governing livestock, crop and plant quality as well as yield in different species is incomplete. For example, this can be evidenced by the persistence of benchmark crop varieties for many decades in spite of the gains achieved over the same period. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that molecular breeding based on DNA markers has led to advances in breeding (animal and crops). However, these advances are not in the way that it was anticipated initially by the researcher in the field. According to several scientists, one of the main reasons for this was related to the evidence that complex target traits such as grain yield, composition or nutritional quality depend on multiple factors in addition to genetics. Therefore, some questions need to be asked: are the current approaches in molecular genetics the most appropriate to deal with complex traits such as yield or quality? Are the current tools for phenotyping complex traits enough to differentiate among genotypes? Do we need to change the way that data is collected and analysed?"

"Taking a broader approach to women's retention in construction: Incorporating the university domain Personnel; Career Barriers; Employed Women Arguably, young professional women commence their transition into the construction industry upon commencement of their university studies. It is possible that women may be exposed to gendered barriers to success both directly and indirectly while at university, which may impact on their intentions of pursuing a career in construction. Construction can be considered as an ecosystem consisting of various interrelated components. This paper aims to extend the 'leaky pipeline' narrative by identifying key actors in the university domain who can influence the retention of young professional women in construction. Faculty can support women in construction through learning and teaching and research activities. A critical reflective approach is used to explore the characteristics of the university learning and teaching environment and the peer-review research process. It is recommended that the university be acknowledged as an integral component of the construction ecosystem. Future research should consider how the university influences and shapes decisions around the retention of women in construction. Without substantial and sustained change across the construction ecosystem, women will remain underrepresented in the construction industry and futile calls for increased participation will continue."

"Human–elephant conflict and land cover change in Sri Lanka Conservation Areas; Elephants; Crop Damage Humanâ€“elephant conflict (HEC) is a key environmental issue in number of Asian countries, including Sri Lanka. Incidents of HEC have significantly increased in Sri Lanka between 1991 and 2018, with 1734 human deaths reported in this period (281% increase), 4837 elephant deaths (1172% increase), 1053 human injuries (140% increase) and more than 23,000 property damage reports (1406% increase). In this study we present a Sri Lanka wide analysis to explore the role of land use and land cover change (LULCC) in relation to HEC, using official government data and a land cover change dataset (1993â€“2018) recently developed by the authors using satellite imagery from the Landsat archive. We investigated rates of HEC over time and compared these to rates of LULCC over the same period. We also present spatial analytics of HEC and LULCC, as well as determining hotspots of HEC and LULCC using a kernel density estimator. Annual HEC incidents were found to broadly increase in line with land use change events (r = 0.43, p < 0.05). Human deaths, elephant deaths, human injuries and property damage hotspots show distinct spatial patterns: human deaths and injuries being more concentrated in the North West, Polonnaruwa and Ampara, wildlife regions; while elephant deaths are spread throughout the HEC region and property damage is high in the Central, Polonnaruwa Anuradhapura, North West, and Southern wildlife regions. We found a strong negative correlation between HEC location and distance to LULCC events. In total, 98% HEC occurred within 1 km of an area that experienced recent LULCC Since 2017, the primary HEC hotspots have shifted to the south and east of the country in concert with LULCC. These countrywide perspectives could help inform HEC mitigation strategies in Sri Lanka and other countries facing similar human-wildlife challenges."
"R&D intensity and carbon emissions in the G7: 1870–2014 Environmental Kuznets Curve; China; Trade Openness We examine the effect of research and development (R&D) intensity on carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions in the Group of Seven (G7) countries since the nineteenth century using a non-parametric panel data model. Our estimates suggest that the relationship between R&D and CO 2 emissions is time-varying. The estimated time-varying coefficient function of R&D was negative for three quarters of the period studied, but was positive for a 35-year period (1955â€“1990) during the second half of the twentieth century. Our non-parametric local linear estimates show that the common trend functions gradually increased for the first 110 years (1870â€“1980), but then flattened out and showed a slight decrease for the next three decades."

"Professional learning: A continuum reimagined Workplace; Vocational Education and Training; Apprenticeship Professional learning is integral to being in the workforce. In this article, ""professional learning"" ranges from student preparation for work, to the ongoing development of graduates in their careers. Given the rise of corporate learning academies and other capability-building programs within organizations, and the changing nature of work, this article highlights a need for universities to reimagine professional learning approaches. We argue that professional learning needs to be considered as a continuum by universities, employers of graduates, and graduates themselves, beyond current ideas about work-integrated learning. Otherwise, the risk is that universities will be left behind or left out of the evolving world of professional learning. We believe the transition between university studies and workplace careers will be smoother and more meaningful if professional learning approaches are aligned, with the student/employee learning journey centre stage. This article uses a comparative personal narrative methodology in exploring what can be learned from the experience of university educators to inform future models of professional learning. Based on the literature and practice examples discussed, future models are likely to include a clear focus on motivation for interdisciplinary social learning in networks. This involves a combination of mobile technology and faceto- face experiences, with a sense of belonging fostered for collaborative ""meaning making"" and enhanced personal and organizational productivity. It is vital to understand the learner context and culture, enable iterative practice using bestfit technology, and encourage critical reflection for transfer of learning to new situations."

"Global research on carbon emissions: A scientometric review Structural Decomposition Analysis; Carbon Emissions; Material Flow Analysis Greenhouse gases such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon dioxide have been recognized as the prime cause of global climate change, which has received significant global attention. Among these gases, carbon dioxide is considered as the prominent gas which motivated researchers to explore carbon reduction and mitigation strategies. Research work on this domain expands from carbon emission reporting to identifying and implementing carbon mitigation and reduction strategies. A comprehensive study to map global research on carbon emissions is, however, not available. Therefore, based on a scientometric analysis method, this study reviewed the global literature on carbon emissions. A total of 2945 bibliographic records, from 1981 to 2019, were extracted from theWeb of Science core collection database and analyzed using techniques such as co-author and co-citation analysis. Findings revealed an increasing trend of publications in the carbon emission research domain, which has been more visible in the past few years, especially during 2016-2018. The most significant contribution to the domain was reported from China, the United States, and England. While most prolific authors and institutions of the domain were from China, authors and institutions from the United States reported the best connection links. It was revealed that evaluating greenhouse gas emissions and estimating the carbon footprint was popular among the researchers. Moreover, climate change and environmental effects of carbon emissions were also significant points of concern in carbon emission research. The key findings of this study will be beneficial for the policymakers, academics, and institutions to determine the future research directions as well as to identify with whom they can consult to assist in developing carbon emission control policies and future carbon reduction targets."
"Recent trends in the synthesis of graphene and graphene oxide based nanomaterials for removal of heavy metals — A review Multi Walled Nanotube; Adsorption; Graphene Oxide The advanced synthesis and development of raw graphene based on various significant functionalization has been outstanding in the wastewater treatment compared to the other alternatives such as carbon nanotubes and other carbon nanomaterials. Nano size graphene is known to possess large surface area and some promising properties in terms of mechanical, electrical, chemical and magnetism. Besides, the graphene can be generated via both Top-down and Bottom-up methods such as chemical exfoliation, chemical vapour deposition and other techniques so that it can be further functionalized to form graphene oxide-based nanomaterials. Hence, graphene oxide-based nanomaterials are discovered to be useful in the application of heavy metal removal from wastewater. In short, this paper critically reviewed on the synthesis method of graphene and application of graphene oxide-based nanomaterials in the term of heavy metal removal. The advantages, drawbacks, comparison of the data efficiencies, and research requirements are further highlighted, elaborated and discussed detailly. Lastly, the future challenges of graphene are elaborated. Therefore, it can be guaranteed that the wastewater discharged should be detected with the minimum or none of the heavy metals so that minimum effects on the ecosystem is discovered."
"Megacity Dhaka: ‘water security syndrome’ and implications for the scholarship of sustainability Sleuths; Cellular Automaton Model; Urbanization The potentials of the scholarship of sustainability present new possibilities for integrated analysis to address syndromes in human-environment systems. A syndrome here means a big-picture complex problem or issue with sustainability implications, such as urban sprawl, land contamination, mass tourism, waste dumping, etc. Through a case historyâ€”that of a â€˜water security syndromeâ€™â€”this paper explores key conceptual aspects for the potential scholarship of sustainability. First, it outlines the scope of this syndrome within the context of one megacity, Dhaka (Bangladesh). Through a holistic literature analysis utilizing systemâ€™s approach six themes are then elucidated, including patterns of change, sectoral impacts, climate change implications, and opportunities to capitalize. A model is constructed representing a â€˜water security syndromeâ€™ in the perspective of developing world, and implications are drawn for the potential scholarship of sustainability."
"A nanotechnology based paper strips assay for rapid detection of Childhood TB Soil nitrogen content (SNC) is an important indicator which strongly correlates with the crop yield and greenhouse gas emissions. The effective monitoring of SNC can also minimise over-fertilization which is a ubiquitous problem in Australia and China. So far the measurements are mainly based on optical, radiometric and electrochemical platforms. However, these technologies are yet capable of applied widely in farmland due to their relatively high cost and non-continuous measurement nature. 
The correlation between nitrogen fertilizers and nitrous oxide gas emission provides a strong base to use low-cost gas sensor networks for monitoring SNC in a real-time and online manner. This project will involve the collaboration between RMIT University (Australia) and Intelirri Technology Co., Ltd., (China) to apply the patented nitrous oxide physisorption gas sensor technology (RMIT) into the smart wireless agriculture platform (Intelirri Technology) to develop the world?s first real-time and online SNC monitoring system. This project will align with the ?Food and agribusiness? priority area and expect to be last for two years. Researchers from RMIT will travel to Beijing to meet with delegates from Intelirri Technology for discussing the feasibility study and business plan. Intelirri Technology will not only provide their patented technologies but also the company-owned farms to assist the system development and evaluation.

"A temporal assessment of microplastics distribution on the beaches of three remote islands of the Yasawa archipelago, Fiji Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter This is the first study that investigated the presence, distribution, and composition of microplastics, MPs (1-5 mm) on beaches in the Yasawa Islands, Fiji. A temporal assessment over three years on six beaches was undertaken to investigate different beach traits on MP abundance. Average MP concentration was 4.5 Â± 11.1 MPsÂ·mâˆ’2 with significantly higher concentrations were found on east-facing beaches than west (p < 0.001), and higher on the storm line compared to the high tide line (p < 0.001). No difference was found between tourist and local beaches (p = 0.21). These results demonstrate the role of current-driven ocean transport of plastic pollution in this part of The South Pacific. ATR FT-IR analysis showed that across all sites 34 % of MPs were polypropylene (PP), 33 % polystyrene (PS), 25 % polyethylene (PE), and 8 % other polymer types. Further studies are needed to assess the potential impacts of MPs on Fiji's coral reefs and marine life."

"The economic rationale for the proposed banking reform in Iceland Financial Crisis; Shadow Banking System; Liquidity Following the traumatic experience of Iceland in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the government is considering seriously a proposal to move to a sovereign money system under which commercial banks do not have the ability to create money by expanding credit. The rationale for such a drastic move can be found in the propositions that fractional reserve banking allows bankers to determine the money supply, that the procyclical behaviour of banks has detrimental consequences for the economy at large, and that the central bank has no power to control the money supply."

"Relative export competitiveness of agricultural commodities and its determinants: Some evidence from India Revealed Comparative Advantage; European Union; Intra-Industry Trade In this paper, we derive time-varying relative export competitiveness (REC) of India's top agricultural exports (rice, wheat, cotton and sugar) against India's share of world agricultural exports (REC_WA) and world exports (REC_WE) from 1961 to 2012. We reveal that India's exports of all four commodities became relatively competitive over time but these were not as competitive as the top, or selected emerging, exporters of the four commodities. We also examine the determinants of REC in these four commodities focusing on factors including crop-specific and aggregate factor endowments, domestic price, export prices, and GDP per capital, preferential trade agreements, export restrictions and bans, and India's Green Revolution. The regression analysis was mainly confined to the 1981â€“2012, due to data constraints. We find that the time series regression results are similar in sign and significance for REC_WE and REC_WA. Our key findings suggest the REC in wheat, rice, and cotton deteriorated as a result of export restrictions. Capital had negative effects on cotton REC. Labor and farm size did not influence the REC in the commodities. The Green Revolution improved the REC in rice and cotton (in Phase 3). The WTO had a positive effect on the REC in rice. The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) Agreement adversely affected the REC in wheat and rice but strengthened the REC in cotton and sugar. Higher domestic price reduced the REC in cotton. Higher per capita income strengthens the REC in wheat with a lag. We explain these results and suggest policy implications."

"Health beliefs and chronic illnesses of refugees: a systematic review Mental Health; Torture; Asylum Objective: To evaluate beliefs, and attitudes about health of refugees with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and posttraumatic stress disorder and the consequent effects on self-care in comparison to resident populations. Design: A systematic review methodology was used. PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were searched for relevant articles. The main terms analysed were health beliefs, chronic conditions and refugee populations. From 844 articles, 45 were retained for further assessment, and finally 5 met the inclusion criteria. Results: Differences in the health beliefs, attitudes and self-care management approaches of refugees compared to resident populations were identified in two studies. The remaining three papers did not make comparisons between the refugees and the resident population, nor did they specifically explore the refugeesâ€™ health beliefs. Of the five studies, three were carried out in Sweden and two in the US. Refugees who have poorer mental and physical health as well as higher prevalence of chronic diseases than the populations among which they resettle seem to lack the knowledge about their illness, symptoms and self-management and thus are less able to control their chronic conditions. Conclusion: The findings highlighted the deficiency in the literature of studies which examine health beliefs and attitudes of minority groups such as refugees who have chronic conditions. The findings also gave insight to the need for a distinctive understanding of refugee health and the management of chronic conditions in comparison to other non-refugee migrant groups. Further research is needed to fully understand the differences between refugees and local populations in terms health beliefs, chronic disease and self-management."

"A method for separation of heavy metal sources in urban groundwater using multiple lines of evidence Brownfield Redevelopment; Brownfields; Contaminated Land Determining sources of heavy metals in soils, sediments and groundwater is important for understanding their fate and transport and mitigating human and environmental exposures. Artificially imported fill, natural sediments and groundwater from 240 ha of reclaimed land at Fishermans Bend in Australia, were analysed for heavy metals and other parameters to determine the relative contributions from different possible sources. Fishermans Bend is Australia's largest urban re-development project, however, complicated land-use history, geology, and multiple contamination sources pose challenges to successful re-development. We developed a method for heavy metal source separation in groundwater using statistical categorisation of the data, analysis of soil leaching values and fill/sediment XRF profiling. The method identified two major sources of heavy metals in groundwater: 1. Point sources from local or up-gradient groundwater contaminated by industrial activities and/or legacy landfills; and 2. contaminated fill, where leaching of Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn was observed. Across the precinct, metals were most commonly sourced from a combination of these sources; however, eight locations indicated at least one metal sourced solely from fill leaching, and 23 locations indicated at least one metal sourced solely from impacted groundwater. Concentrations of heavy metals in groundwater ranged from 0.0001 to 0.003 mg/L (Cd), 0.001â€“0.1 mg/L (Cr), 0.001â€“0.2 mg/L (Cu), 0.001â€“0.5 mg/L (Ni), 0.001â€“0.01 mg/L (Pb), and 0.005â€“1.2 mg/L (Zn). Our method can determine the likely contribution of different metal sources to groundwater, helping inform more detailed contamination assessments and precinct-wide management and remediation strategies. A method for heavy metal source separation in groundwater has been developed for use in large-scale urban re-development settings, to inform contamination assessments, and remediation strategies."
"The ‘bad’ and exceptionally ‘good’: constructing the African refugee Refugees; Migrant Workers; Asylum An increase in refugees entering Australia from Africa, particularly Sudan, in recent times has inspired debate about the implications associated with immigration. Combining insights from the fields of discourse theory and metaphor analysis, this work explores the construction of the African refugee as presented in the Australian tabloid news media newspapers the Herald Sun and The Daily Telegraph. Special attention is dedicated to how the â€˜badâ€™ and â€˜goodâ€™ African refugees have been constructed. While the constitution of the â€˜goodâ€™ refugee appears to be a positive development, it is argued that the way in which this has been done does more harm than good as it reinforces the idea that it is unusual for African refugees to be non-violent and successful."

"Antibacterial Packaging Solutions Globally, 32% of the food produced in the world for human consumption becomes waste (FAO, 2011). Food waste refers to food that is discarded that is still edible. Reducing food losses/waste would greatly contribute to abating worldwide sustainability challenges such as food security, natural resources shortages and climate change. Japan's food mileage index in 2001 was 900 billion ton-kilometres that equates to more than three times that of the United States, which has more than twice Japan's population. Food mileage is calculated by multiplying the transportation distance with the volume of food transported. The higher the food mileage the larger the load placed on the global environment. This is particularly relevant for the import of fresh produce such as meats that require packaging to preserve and extend shelf-life. The principle factor for faster breakdown of food products is contamination of the product through exposure to microorganisms. "

"Elite capture of local participatory governance Citizen Participation; Local Government; Publicity Elite capture is a major barrier to citizen engagement in local governance processes in many developing countries. Data from six case studies of development initiatives in Bangladesh show that, in spite of attempts by aid donors and others to ensure citizen participation, programmes are dominated by a nexus of local elites including MPs and bureaucrats. Local stakeholders do not understand the value that direct citizen participation can bring, and citizens are unaware of their rights and wary of challenging elites. Monitoring of requirements for citizen participation is weak, and the management of some programmes deters participation. Representatives are sometimes selected by elites and legal frameworks are not sufficiently strong or enforced consistently. We conclude that a range of additional and effectively implemented policy measures are required to reduce the extent and effects of elite capture in developing countries."
