"Automatic fish species classification in underwater videos: Exploiting pre-trained deep neural network models to compensate for limited labelled data Fish; Etelis; Snapper There is a need for automatic systems that can reliably detect, track and classify fish and other marine species in underwater videos without human intervention. Conventional computer vision techniques do not perform well in underwater conditions where the background is complex and the shape and textural features of fish are subtle. Data-driven classification models like neural networks require a huge amount of labelled data, otherwise they tend to over-fit to the training data and fail on unseen test data which is not involved in training. We present a state-of-the-art computer vision method for fine-grained fish species classification based on deep learning techniques. A cross-layer pooling algorithm using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network as a generalized feature detector is proposed, thus avoiding the need for a large amount of training data. Classification on test data is performed by a SVM on the features computed through the proposed method, resulting in classification accuracy of 94.3% for fish species from typical underwater video imagery captured off the coast of Western Australia. This research advocates that the development of automated classification systems which can identify fish from underwater video imagery is feasible and a cost-effective alternative to manual identification by humans."
"Australia-Japan local government collaboration: building sustainable and resilient communities Australia-Japan local governments have established a foundation of collaboration, especially in cultural and education exchanges to promote peace over the last 50 years (e.g., through sister cities). Our project aims to rejuvenate the collaboration between Australia-Japan local governments by improving the visibility of Australia-Japan city-level international collaborations, identifying new directions and forms of collaborative efforts to build sustainable and resilient communities, such as practices in disaster response and public health management (e.g. COVID-19), supporting vulnerable communities, and building smart cities. We will conduct cross-country surveys to map an overview of Australia-Japan sister city collaborations; use document analyses, 10 case studies and interviews with key
stakeholders to identify innovative practices in sustainable and resilient community building; use virtual webinars and forums or roundtable discussions with stakeholders and media publications to raise public awareness; and facilitate networking, knowledge sharing and inter-institution collaboration between both countries.

"A Lossless Data-Hiding based IoT Data Authenticity Model in Edge-AI for Connected Living Diagnostic Imaging; Steganography; Data Hiding Edge computing is an emerging technology for the acquisition of Internet-of-Things (IoT) data and provisioning different services in connected living. Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered edge devices (edge-AI) facilitate intelligent IoT data acquisition and services through data analytics. However, data in edge networks are prone to several security threats such as external and internal attacks and transmission errors. Attackers can inject false data during data acquisition or modify stored data in the edge data storage to hamper data analytics. Therefore, an edge-AI device must verify the authenticity of IoT data before using them in data analytics. This article presents an IoT data authenticity model in edge-AI for a connected living using data hiding techniques. Our proposed data authenticity model securely hides the data source's identification number within IoT data before sending it to edge devices. Edge-AI devices extract hidden information for verifying data authenticity. Existing data hiding approaches for biosignal cannot reconstruct original IoT data after extracting the hidden message from it (i.e., lossy) and are not usable for IoT data authenticity. We propose the first lossless IoT data hiding technique in this article based on error-correcting codes (ECCs). We conduct several experiments to demonstrate the performance of our proposed method. Experimental results establish the lossless property of the proposed approach while maintaining other data hiding properties."
"Enhancing the digital adaptability of Australian retail small businesses Australia has more than 2 million small businesses. Their digital capability is important to provide the engine for post COVID-19 recovery to the economy. While there are successful cases of small businesses using technology/services from Australian telecommunications providers, the sudden change associated with COVID-19 revealed that many struggled to adapt to the new environment. Why? How could Australian telecommunications providers enhance the digital adaptability of small businesses? This project, using a co-design approach, aims to identify issues that small businesses face in using digital services offered by Australian telecoms and provide recommendations on the best strategies to address these challenges."
"Association Between Online Social Influence and Corporal Punishment: An Experimental Study Corporal Punishment; Child Abuse; Parenting Online news stories about child corporal punishment (CP) often receive news user comments that are incongruent with scientific reports and expertsâ€™ advice. Recent research suggests that comments and approval ratings on news websites can be sources of social influence that affects perceptions and behaviors. However, little research has investigated the influence of online comments and approval ratings on CP perceptions and behavior. Using the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction, this study employed a 2 (comments: congruent vs. incongruent) Ã— 2 (approval ratings: low vs. high) randomized between-subject experimental design to examine the effect of online comments and approval ratings on intentions to use CP and support for CP prevention policy (N = 458). Findings indicated that while comments exerted an effect on perceptions of CP, approval ratings did not. Specifically, compared to participants who viewed congruent comments, those who viewed incongruent comments reported higher injunctive norms (Î² =.94, 95% CI [.72, 1.14]), higher descriptive norms (Î² =.33, 95% CI [.17,.49]), and greater favorable attitudes toward CP (Î² =.37, 95% CI [.21, 53]). The results of the mediation analyses demonstrated that incongruent comments indirectly increase intentions to use CP via injunctive norms (Î² =.14, 95% CI [.04,.25]) and attitudes (Î² =.30, 95% CI [.18,.45]). These comments were also found to decrease support for CP prevention policy via injunctive norms (Î² = âˆ’.10, 95% CI [âˆ’.20, âˆ’.01]) and attitudes (Î² = âˆ’.18, 95% CI [âˆ’.28, âˆ’.11]). The findings have implications for research and interventions using mass media to convey CP prevention messages."

"Antibacterial Liquid Metals: Biofilm Treatment via Magnetic Activation Antenna; Galinstan; Ecoflex Antibiotic resistance has made the treatment of biofilm-related infections challenging. As such, the quest for next-generation antimicrobial technologies must focus on targeted therapies to which pathogenic bacteria cannot develop resistance. Stimuli-responsive therapies represent an alternative technological focus due to their capability of delivering targeted treatment. This study provides a proof-of-concept investigation into the use of magneto-responsive gallium-based liquid metal (LM) droplets as antibacterial materials, which can physically damage, disintegrate, and kill pathogens within a mature biofilm. Once exposed to a low-intensity rotating magnetic field, the LM droplets become physically actuated and transform their shape, developing sharp edges. When placed in contact with a bacterial biofilm, the movement of the particles resulting from the magnetic field, coupled with the presence of nanosharp edges, physically ruptures the bacterial cells and the dense biofilm matrix is broken down. The antibacterial efficacy of the magnetically activated LM particles was assessed against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial biofilms. After 90 min over 99% of both bacterial species became nonviable, and the destruction of the biofilms was observed. These results will impact the design of next-generation, LM-based biofilm treatments."
"Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) Enabler Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) is at Technology Readiness Level 9, but adoption has been slow in Australia
because it reframes distributed solar energy as a building product which needs close collaborations between the PV
and building industries. It is difficult to develop a business case for a BIPV project without accessible information and
value-for-money solutions. This project aims to translate technical complexities into a packaged, user friendly platform
that integrates product, regulation, technical, economic and construction data to create the best BIPV solution for
individual building projects. It intends to provide a one-stop solution for all BIPV stakeholders cross the PV, energy,
building and regulatory sectors. This project will provide the facility required to move BIVP from Commercial Readiness
Index 2 to Commercial Readiness Index 3 in Australia and should accelerate market adoption of BIPV that unifies
precast PV modules with the overall building outer surface, including every wall and window in both residential and
commercial buildings. The project will enable all BIPV products and studies to be applied in the real building market as
easy as possible."
"Silicon-based metasurfaces for vortex beam generation Berry Phase; Holograms; Optics Silicon metasurfaces were fabricated on fused silica substrates by using sputtering, electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching. A chromium etch mask was used to protect the silicon during plasma etching. We designed a hologram with phase range of 0 - 1.17Ï€ to generate a higher order Bessel beam. The device produced the expected beam profile and the presence of charge 3 was confirmed using a interference test. Tests on spiral plate devices were less successful owing to the thickness non-uniformity in the sputtered Si film."

"Go hydrogen! Promoting Japanese awareness of Australian hydrogen The purpose of the activity is to deliver the project AJF2021104 -Go hydrogen! Promoting Japanese awareness of Australian hydrogen. This project aims to promote Japanese awareness of Australian hydrogen production. Australia and Japan have developed a bilateral trade partnership through hydrogen production. From 2021, Australian hydrogen will be exported to Kobe using a special cargo ship designed in Japan. This world-first hydrogen export project has been developed jointly by thepublic and private sectors of both countries. However, as highlighted at the Australia Japan Business Co-operation Committee’s webinar in April 2021, information on Australian hydrogen has not been adequately communicated to Japanese citizens. Unlike standard Australian export products, it is hard for Japanese people to understand where and how Australian hydrogen is produced. In collaboration with Tohoku University, this project will develop visual communication content to raise Japanese citizens’ awareness of Australian hydrogen production. Communication content will include material such as short videos, fact sheets, posters, technical diagrams, and other learning material. This project will contribute to increase awareness of Australian hydrogen and support Japan’s transition to renewable energy. It also promotes the Japan-Australia Partnership on Decarbonisation through Technology signed by Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga at the G7 on 13 June 2021."

"Analytics for awareness in maritime surveillance: from data to tactical insight Safety; Awareness; Accident Investigation Although significant effort has occurred into developing realistic simulation environments for maritime surveillance, relatively little attention has been given to objectively summarizing and providing platforms for querying the mission simulation outputs for post-mission debriefing purposes. In this paper we adopt recently proposed data analytic ideas for this context and illustrate the proposed approach using multi-layered statistical methods from visualization to Bayesian network-based data interpretation models. Analyzing example missions in these terms demonstrates the potential use for such technologies for objective and insightful post-mission analyses."
"Using indigenous terrestrial micro-invertebrates to assess environmental impacts of soil pollution in Antarctica. Previous waste disposal practices and current human activities in Antarctica have resulted in a number of contaminated sites. To assess, mitigate and remediate these sites an understanding is required of how native organisms respond to contamination. Terrestrial micro-invertebrates play key roles in ecosystem processes (e.g. nutrient cycling) but little is known about the responses of Antarctic species to pollutants. This project will assess the responses of key micro-invertebrates from East Antarctica (e.g. nematodes, rotifers, tardigrades) to hydrocarbon and metal pollution in soils. It will be the first Antarctic project to assess the impact of soil characteristics and freeze-thaw cycles on contaminant toxicity and the effectiveness of the Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon test in measuring toxicity. Data from this work will contribute to development of guidelines for site assessment, management and remediation, aimed at protecting Australia's Antarctic Territory."
"Novel, host-directed, and selective anti-HIV agents Although drugs are currently available for HIV, the virus’ ability to mutate rapidly allows it to acquire resistance to existing drugs that directly target HIV’s own proteins. Rising drug-resistance threatens the long-term effectiveness of current anti-HIV drugs, making the search for new antivirals for HIV a compelling need. A way to overcome drug resistance is to develop antivirals targeting host proteins, such as DDX3X (DEAD-Box Helicase 3, XLinked) that HIV subverts to ‘assist’ the viral life cycle. Current DDX3X inhibitors can limit the
replication of HIV [1, 2], including drug-resistant HIV [3], and are patented (PCT/IB2010/054475; PCT/EP2016/052990), validating DDX3X as an anti-HIV target. The problem with these inhibitors is that they target the highly conserved active site of DDX3X, which is common to all 42 DDX family members; these inhibitors are therefore likely to target multiple human DEAD-Box helicases (DDXs),
with long-term use almost certainly leading to deleterious side-effects/toxicity."

"Unraveling the Role of CeO2in Stabilization of Multivalent Mn Species on α-MnO2/Mn3O4/CeO2/C Surface for Enhanced Electrocatalysis Zinc Air Batteries; Electrocatalysts; Catalyst A hybrid heteronanostructure of Î±-MnO2/Mn3O4/CeO2 with the atomic-level coupled nanointerface entrenched in Vulcan carbon is reported and explored for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CeO2 plays an essential role in increasing the surface Mn2+/3+/4+ in Î±-MnO2/Mn3O4/CeO2/C for ORR/OER processes. It shows enhanced bifunctional activity, superior to that of the benchmark 20 wt % Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts. It displays an ORR onset potential of -0.13 V (vs Ag/AgCl), limiting current density of -6.63 mA cm-2 (at 1600 rpm), mass-specific current of 47.6 mA mgMO-1 with a lower Tafel slope (921.9 mV dec-1), and an inclusive 4-e transfer involved in ORR. The OER onset potential and current density are 0.58 V (vs Ag/AgCl) and 8.45 mA cm-2 (at 0.8 V). The unique hybrid structure with oxide-oxide interface in Î±-MnO2/Mn3O4/CeO2 is correlated to explain the mechanistic pathway. Multistate Mn(II/III/IV) and Ce(III/IV) synergistically influence in tendering superior activity with enhanced stability."

"Selecting pinning nodes to control complex networked systems Complex Dynamical Networks; Time Lag; Exponential Synchronization One of the fundamental problems in pinning control of complex networks is selecting appropriate pinning nodes, such that the whole system is controlled. This is particularly useful for complex networks with huge numbers of nodes. Recent research has yielded several pinning node selection strategies, which may be efficient. However, selecting a set of pinning nodes and identifying the nodes that should be selected first remain challenging problems. In this paper, we present a network control strategy based on left Perron vector. For directed networks where nodes have the same in- and out-degrees, there has so far been no effective pinning node selection strategy, but our method can find suitable nodes. Likewise, our method also performs well for undirected networks where the nodes have the same degree. In addition, we can derive the minimum set of pinning nodes and the order in which they should be selected for given coupling strengths. Our proofs of these results depend on the properties of non-negative matrices and M-matrices. Several examples show that this strategy can effectively select appropriate pinning nodes, and that it can achieve better results for both directed and undirected networks."

"Water Wars: A “Critical Listening In” to Rural Radio Discourse on a River System in Trouble News Media; Framing; Journalism For news media on the earth's driest continent, changes in the health and politics of Australia's largest river system, the Murray-Darling, have been a major national focus for decades. In recent times, climate crisis, drought and policy failure have combined to threaten its future, putting the issue under intense public scrutiny. This article offers a critical discourse analysis of specialist rural radio coverage of the issue in 2018â€“19. It identifies the discourses that the Country Hour program presents and considers the voices and viewpoints that are absent. Two critical discourse moments are analyzed: an ecological disaster in which more than one million fish died, and #watergateâ€“a pre-election scandal over commercial water rights. We map the strategies and roles of Country Hour journalists and other social actors in legitimating the â€œproductive useâ€ of the river system above all else, politicizing the issue and shifting responsibility for the river's wellbeing."

"Meat Industry Efficiency and Innovation Capacity Enhancement; Benchmarking Technologies and systems from Automotive Industry This project will focus on accelerating the adoption of new technologies by benchmarking the competitive, and sustainable Automotive manufacturing industry. The Automotive industry, as a high volume- low margin sector, is the pioneer in automating manual tasks, by developing the most advanced and cost-effective systems.
Development of innovative manufacturing, processing, materials handling solutions and technologies as well as management systems and appropriate culture has helped the automotive industry to stay efficient and sustainable for many years. On the other hand the Australian automotive industry is leaving a huge number of culturally trained and skilled workers behind.
All the above mentioned makes the need for an extensive research in adapting and using the already existing technologies, strategies and systems in the Automotive industry inevitable. A PhD research project for the duration of 3 years to study the possibilities and potentials for the red meat industry to adapt technologies and solutions in the field of automation, materials handling solutions, management of processes and procedures, and quality assurance systems developed and used by the Automotive industry is proposed.
The research outcomes will generate a database for a rapid knowledge transfer in order to improve red meat industry's innovation capacity on a sustained basis. This will ensure quick knowledge transfer by enabling the industry to acquire skills, as well as a huge number of skilled and culturally trained, unemployed workforce. This database will generate a bank for several future research activities in line with the AMPC capability building strategic plans."

"Numerical investigation of multi-SDBD plasma actuators for controlling fluctuating wind load on building roofs Plasma Jets; Actuator; Airfoils The present research aims to explore, by large-eddy simulation (LES), the potentiality and mechanism of multiple surface dielectric barrier discharge (multi-SDBD) plasma actuators to manipulate mean and fluctuating wind loads on a low-rise building. Three actuator configurations are located on the roof to induce directional wall jets in different directions. The effects of these configurations on flow structure and wind loads are studied in absence and presence of approaching flow. Results show that all subgrid-scale models can obtain accurate roof pressure, and for the diffusion and convection terms, the bounded central differencing scheme can provide more accurate predictions for the roof pressure. The control impact of active actuators gradually weakens with the increase of the approaching flow velocity. The direction of the wall jet can determine the position of the limited roof region with the reduced mean pressure coefficient. The multi-SDBD actuators continue to absorb the upstream flow and blow this flow downstream, meaning the wall jet exerts strong pressure on the local roof area at the end of the jet, which results in a significant reduction of the mean pressure coefficient. Furthermore, the counter-rotating vortices caused by the wall jet restrain the size and strength of the vortex shedding, thereby achieving the purpose of reducing the fluctuating pressure coefficient. Further analysis of the instantaneous vorticity fields indicates that the intensity and size of streamwise shedding vortices can be restrained by small-scale spanwise vortices induced by the plasma actuators. Under the action of the wall jet blowing from the trailing edge to the leading edge, the fluctuating lift and drag coefficients can be reduced by over 15% and the fluctuating pressure coefficient can be reduced by about 20% from the no actuation situation."

"Opportunities for Growth: Australia and Viet Nam Australia's economicengagement with Viet Nam lags that of its Asian neighbours. in 2018, Viet Nam was  Australia's 15th largesttrading partner, ranking behind Hong Kong, Taiwan and Indonesia. Viet Nam's rapid  growth over the last few decades offers tremendous opportunities. in the third quarter of 2019, Viet Nam recorded 7 per cent growth. Australia's two-way trade with Viet Nam is forecast to grow at almost 11% over the next 5 years, second only to India.
The governments of both countries have recognised this potential and established a strategic partnership to deepen the relationship.Akey priority is developing an Enhanced Economic Engagement Strategy with the goal of becoming top ten trade partners and doubling investment. The Prime Ministers of both countries expressed support forfacilrtating agricultural market access and collaboration on energy security and digital opportunities.
To achieve these overarching goals, businesses on the ground need access to timely information on the products, services and sectors that offer the most viable opportunities. Interested entrants need market intelligence to allow them to make an informed judgement on how best to enter the market. Operating in a foreign market also requires an understanding of local challenges, non-tariff barriers and ways to address them. There is a need for research to identify the specific barriers that Australian businesses face in Viet Nam, provide case studies of successful ventures, share best practice and recommend policy reforms.
The Asia Society and Australian APEC Study Centre at RMIT University are jointly developing a business-friendly research report to further enhance engagement with Viet Nam."

Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Further, a detailed environmental toxicology assessment will be performed for all the water samples. On the basis of generated data sets a correlation between use of sun cream and its environment impact will be generated and a theory will be postulated that will try to answer the following question, whether the sun cream has any effect or noeffect
on Australian marine environment."
"A nanotechnology based paper strips assay for rapid detection of Childhood TB Soil nitrogen content (SNC) is an important indicator which strongly correlates with the crop yield and greenhouse gas emissions. The effective monitoring of SNC can also minimise over-fertilization which is a ubiquitous problem in Australia and China. So far the measurements are mainly based on optical, radiometric and electrochemical platforms. However, these technologies are yet capable of applied widely in farmland due to their relatively high cost and non-continuous measurement nature. 
The correlation between nitrogen fertilizers and nitrous oxide gas emission provides a strong base to use low-cost gas sensor networks for monitoring SNC in a real-time and online manner. This project will involve the collaboration between RMIT University (Australia) and Intelirri Technology Co., Ltd., (China) to apply the patented nitrous oxide physisorption gas sensor technology (RMIT) into the smart wireless agriculture platform (Intelirri Technology) to develop the world?s first real-time and online SNC monitoring system. This project will align with the ?Food and agribusiness? priority area and expect to be last for two years. Researchers from RMIT will travel to Beijing to meet with delegates from Intelirri Technology for discussing the feasibility study and business plan. Intelirri Technology will not only provide their patented technologies but also the company-owned farms to assist the system development and evaluation.

"Tensile behavior of polymer nanocomposite reinforced with graphene containing defects Single Walled Nanotube; Graphite; Carbon Nanotubes This paper investigates the tensile behavior in both armchair and zigzag directions of polymer nanocomposites reinforced with defective single layer graphene containing single or double vacancies by using molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the overall material properties including Young's modulus, ultimate strength and strain in both directions decrease with an increasing number of missing atoms but are insensitive to defect distribution. Compared with double-vacancy, single-vacancy defects have a more significant influence on the material properties due to more dangling bonds in its structure. In addition, it is found that the defect type, size and location also play an important role in the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite. The mechanism of these defect parameters underlying the tensile behavior of graphene reinforced epoxy nanocomposite is explored at the nanoscale."

"An Improved Method for Rainfall Forecast Based on GNSS-PWV Precipitable Water; Global Positioning System; GNSS Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) has been applied to the sounding of precipitable water vapor (PWV) due to its high accuracy and high spatiotemporal resolutions. PWV obtained from GNSS (GNSS-PWV) can be used to investigate extreme weather phenomena, such as the formation mechanism and prediction of rainfalls. In the study, a new, improved model for rainfall forecasting was developed based on GNSS data and rainfall data for the 9-year period from 2010 to 2018 at 66 stations located in the USA. The new model included three prediction factorsâ€”PWV value, PWV increase, maximum hourly PWV increase. The two key tasks involved for the development of the model were the determination of the thresholds for each prediction factor and the selection of the optimal strategy for using the three prediction factors together. For determining the thresholds, both critical success index (CSI) and true skill statistic (TSS) were tested, and results showed that TSS outperformed CSI for all rainfall events tested. Then, various strategies by combining the three prediction factors together were also tested, and results indicated that the best forecast result was from the case that any two of the prediction factors were over their own thresholds. Finally, the new model was evaluated using the GNSS data for the 2-year period from 2019 to 2020 at the above mentioned 66 stations, and the probability of detection (POD) and false-alarms rate (FAR) were adopted to measure the model performances. Over the 66 stations, the POD values ranged from 73% to 97% with the mean of 87%, and the FARs ranged from 26% to 77% with the mean of 53%. Moreover, it was also found that both POD and FAR values were related to the region of the station; e.g., the results at the stations that are located in humid regions were better than the ones located in dry regions. All these results suggest the feasibility and good performance of using GNSS-PWV for forecasting rainfall."
"Antibacterial Packaging Solutions Globally, 32% of the food produced in the world for human consumption becomes waste (FAO, 2011). Food waste refers to food that is discarded that is still edible. Reducing food losses/waste would greatly contribute to abating worldwide sustainability challenges such as food security, natural resources shortages and climate change. Japan's food mileage index in 2001 was 900 billion ton-kilometres that equates to more than three times that of the United States, which has more than twice Japan's population. Food mileage is calculated by multiplying the transportation distance with the volume of food transported. The higher the food mileage the larger the load placed on the global environment. This is particularly relevant for the import of fresh produce such as meats that require packaging to preserve and extend shelf-life. The principle factor for faster breakdown of food products is contamination of the product through exposure to microorganisms. "

"A new strategy in the search for treatments for early onset preeclampsia Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious disorder of human pregnancy characterized by new onset hypertension and maternal organ dysfunction in the 2nd
half of gestation. Early onset PE (EPE) occurs before 34 weeks of gestation and is the most dangerous form, often accompanied by fetal growth
restriction due to placental insufficiency. EPE has life-threatening and lifelong consequences for both the mother and baby. Despite its severity
and long term impacts, there is still no effective way to treat EPE other than premature delivery. The reason for the lack of therapies is partly due
to the complexity of the syndrome, and partly because the underlying causes are not well understood."
"Effectiveness and application of an online leadership intervention to promote mental health and reduce depression-related stigma in organizations Mental Health Recovery; Peer Group; Mental Disease Addressing the stigma of mental illness and its effect in the workplace is a contemporary issue in occupational health. The role of leaders is a vital but relatively unexplored dimension of this phenomenon. This study examined the effectiveness and application of an online intervention to reduce depression-related stigma in organizational leaders. A randomized controlled, ""in the field"" study was conducted with 196 leaders. Participants completed an online survey and were randomly assigned to either the experimental or wait-list control group. One week later, participants in the experimental group were given access to a brief online workplace mental health intervention and asked to complete a postsurvey, whereas the control group had to only complete the online postsurvey. Six months later, participants completed a follow-up online survey. Results revealed significant reductions in behavioral and affective depression-related stigma scores among leaders who completed the intervention, compared with the control group. These reductions were similar at 6 months. The factors that enabled or hindered training transfer from the intervention were examined through semistructured interviews with 16 of the participating leaders. Results showed that positive attitudes and high levels of knowledge are not sufficient to ensure leaders apply intervention learning in their work environments.

"Effects of volumetric fraction and included angle of composite particles on the discharge of binary mixtures in hoppers Settling Velocity; Liquid; Power-Law Fluid The discharge behavior of particles is important in many industrial applications, such as in the core of a pebble bed reactor, which uses a hopper bed filled with many large particles. In this work, a mixture composed of two particle types, freely discharged from a pebble bed, is simulated using the discrete-element method. One is a spherical pebble of diameter equal to that of the fuel pebble of the reactor. The other is a composite particle comprising three spherical pebbles bonded together. The included angle Î± of the three pebbles characterized the particle conformation, which may affect the discharge behavior of the mixture. The effects of volume fraction of the multi-sphere Ï‡ (equivalent to the number fraction) on the discharge are also analyzed. Flow patterns, number flow rate, discharge velocity, and mean force of the mixture are computed to help in revealing discharge features. The results show that increasing either Î± or Ï‡ reduces the discharge flow rate. Fittings and correlations give a quantitative evaluation of the independent effects of Î± and Ï‡. The analysis of velocity and force explains the mechanism relevant to the main influencing factors Î± and Ï‡. The results are helpful in gaining a better understanding of the discharge feature of binary mixtures and in providing a quantitative evaluation of the discharge behavior of the reactor core, especially adverse failure conditions."

"Popular Music Heritage, Grass-Roots Activism and Web 2.0: The Case of the ‘Save the Palace’ Campaign Music Industry; Punk; Music Although the study of popular music heritage is rapidly becoming an established aspect of academic research, little attention has been focused on attempts made by groups of music fans to preserve aspects of their local popular music heritage when these are seen to come under threat. This article examines the â€˜Save the Palaceâ€™ campaign in Melbourne, Australia, and argues that it provides an important illustration of the tenacity of local music fans when faced with the closure of an important venue, and their capacity to organise themselves into a cohesive campaign through social media technology. Through its examination of the online interactions that characterised the Save the Palace campaign, the article also facilitates an extension of the concept of the virtual scene beyond its more conventionally understood definition as a platform for fan discussion dedicated to a specific artist, genre or place. In the case of Save the Palace, a different manifestation of a scene is observed whereby fans of a broad range of artists and genres temporarily join forces online to protest against the threat to a specific aspect of their shared local music heritage. In this sense, Save the Palace also sheds significant light on how social media assist in giving a voice to competing discourses of cultural value. Thus, even as the Palace and countless other local music landmarks like it across the world are demolished to make way for new developments, their significance as important markers of local generational identity and belonging, and of emotionally inscribed urban identity, remains. Through their online sharing of personalised memories of the Palace as an iconic music venue, supporters of the Save the Palace campaign serve as a further example of how the internet has worked to broaden our understanding of the definition, nature and function of popular music heritage."
"Amplitude-frequency analysis of emotional speech using transfer learning and classification of spectrogram images Emotion Recognition; Emotional Speech; Emotion Automatic speech emotion recognition (SER) techniques based on acoustic analysis show high confusion between certain emotional categories. This study used an indirect approach to provide insights into the amplitude-frequency characteristics of different emotions in order to support the development of future, more efficiently differentiating SER methods. The analysis was carried out by transforming short 1-second blocks of speech into RGB or grey-scale images of spectrograms. The images were used to fine-tune a pre-trained image classification network to recognize emotions. Spectrogram representation on four different frequency scales - linear, melodic, equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB), and logarithmic - allowed observation of the effects of high, mid-high, mid-low and low frequency characteristics of speech, respectively. Whereas the use of either red (R), green (G) or blue (B) components of RGB images showed the importance of speech components with high, mid and low amplitude levels, respectively. Experiments conducted on the Berlin emotional speech (EMO-DB) data revealed the relative positions of seven emotional categories (anger, boredom, disgust, fear, joy, neutral and sadness) on the amplitude-frequency plane."

"Inclusive health care for LGBTQ+ youth: support, belonging, and inclusivity labour Transgender Persons; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Sexual Behavior Drawing on findings from a study of two social generations of gender and sexuality diverse Australians, this paper offers a critical analysis of expectations and experiences of inclusive health care for LGBTQ+ youth. Data were collected by means of individual and focus group interviews with people from two different social generations who grew up in regional or urban Australia: those born in the 1970s (n = 50) and those born in the 1990s (n = 71). Data were analysed inductively to develop insights into what inclusive health care meant, and what this revealed about the potential for fostering belonging in healthcare settings. Findings raise critical questions about how inclusiveness of care might best be understood in encounters between gender and sexual minorities and health professionals. In particular, forms of â€˜inclusivity labourâ€™ were observed across the social generations, both in terms of the work involved in seeking to locate supportive services, and in assessing the performance of clinicians in healthcare settings, with implications for the continued engagement of LGBTQ+ young people with essential forms of care. Mobilising contemporary forms of inclusivity labour, including attention to the affective dimensions of healthcare engagement, has the potential to promote both better health and more meaningful experiences of belonging for gender and sexual minorities."
"Social accounting in the context of profound political, social and economic crisis: the case of the Arab Spring Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: This paper explores how social accounting operates in the context of profound political, social and economic crises. Specifically, it examines how companies constructed strategies of action to produce and organise social accounting practices under different sociopolitical and economic contexts prior to and after the Arab Spring. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on Swidler's theory of â€œCulture Toolkitâ€ and 43 semi-structured interviews with 17 firms and their stakeholders in the Arab region. Findings: The study argues that context influences social accounting practices by shaping a cultural toolkit of habits, skills and styles from which companies develop their social accounting related strategies of action. During â€œsettledâ€ periods, companies draw on resources to develop their social accounting practices whilst they seek knowledge and feedback on boundaries and expectations of the socio-political and economic contexts. During â€œunsettledâ€ periods, companies begin to adopt highly organised meaning systems (i.e. ideologies) from which new ways and methods of social accounting practices are deployed. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the extant literature by providing insights into social accounting practices in the under-explored context of the profound political, social and economic crises that followed the Arab Spring. In addition, we introduce Swidler's Culture Toolkit theory to the accounting literature."

"Design and optimized fabrication techniques for highly-efficient dielectric meta-optical Airy beam generators Berry Phase; Holograms; Optics Dielectric meta-surface optical elements are of interest for a variety of interests, one of which is due to their high efficiency. Elements with binary structures that are easy to fabricate can have more than two phase levels, unlike diffractive elements. Previously reported work on meta-surfaces for complex light generation has focused mainly on beams with orbital angular momentum or Bessel beams. A few papers also talk about Airy beams. The latter have been found to have important applications in areas such as light sheet microscopy. These earlier papers describe the meta-surfaces in detail without dwelling on the various design and fabrication steps required to achieve a highly efficient element. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the design process in detail and highlight the key parameters that must be carefully optimized for successful fabrication. Finally, test results of a highly efficient, dielectric meta-surface cubic phase plate (CPP) are presented. The element has 8 phase levels and generates an Airy beam at the wavelength of 1064 nm. The focus of this work is to present a detailed step-by-step design flow, as well as the means by which to optimize the fabrication of those 8 levels. The phase variation is achieved by a change in the lateral dimensions. While the sizes are unique for each phase level, they are all sub-micron and this is where the fabrication challenge lies."

"Soft rocks, hard rocks: the world’s resources and reserves of Ti and Zr and associated critical minerals Pegmatite; Deposits; Heavy Mineral Titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), vanadium (V), garnet, and rare earth elements (REO) and their associated minerals are essential for modern society. Despite this, comprehensive public understanding of Ti and Zr resources and reserves (including garnet, Hf contained in zircon, V in titanomagnetite, and REO contained in co/by-product monazite) has been limited.This has led to uncertainty over the possibility of supply shortages in these minerals and has also led to confusion over which Ti and Zr minerals may be in short supply. Addressing this, we compile an extensive database of the worldâ€™s known Ti and Zr mineral deposits including ore grades, co-products, mineral quality, and geological settings. Our data indicate that 327 mineral deposits in 25 countries contain a collective 2,648 Mt TiO2 in ilmenite, rutile and leucoxene, 155 Mt of Zr minerals, 23.5 Mt of V, 16.2 Mt of REO and 17.5 Mt of garnet. Just 31% of TiO2 exists within traditional sedimentary deposits (placer and palaeo-placer deposits, but here referred to as sedimentary), with the remainder contained within igneous (54%), metamorphic (1%), and laterite deposits (14%). For igneous TiO2, 58% is contained within ilmenite, 42% in titanomagnetite, and <1% in rutile. 93% of total zirconium minerals are contained in sedimentary deposits. Forward modelling presented in this paper indicates that Ti and Zr resources and reserves are sufficient to meet global demand for several decades. Overall, this unique study presents extensive data on Zr, Ti, Hf, V, garnet and REO resources, makes comments on the future availability of these elements and will therefore be a practical resource for researchers, policymakers, and investors alike."

"Reducing tumour incidence in adolescents with germ-line mutations in RECQL4 (Administered by St Vincents Hospital) This proposal addresses Stream 2: Cancer in adolescents.
Substantiating evidence of direct relevance to grant call: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common cancer of bone, with a peak incidence during late childhood and adolescence. OS affects 3.4 people per million each year (2.7-4.3; 95% CI) in Australia, with its incidence increasing 1.1% annually between 1983-2015 (1). For patients with localised disease, 5-year survival rates have stagnated at 70% and no substantive changes to treatment (conventional chemotherapy and surgery) have been achieved for greater than three decades (2).
Patients with metastatic or relapsed OS currently have a 20-30% 5-yr survival rate (3), and there is an urgent need to identify new therapeutics for this cohort. Whole genome sequencing and exome capture have transformed our understanding of the genetics of conventional human OS, with the universal mutation of TP53 accompanied by recurrent mutation of RB1, ATRX and DLG2 in 29-53% of cases (4-6). However, to date no clinically actionable targets have been defined using these approaches."

"Nebulised Nano-therapeutics for the treatment of drug resistant Tuberculosis. (Grant number 414953790) Tuberculosis (TB) is a global disease, found in every country in the world. The World Health Organization estimates that two billion people ?one third of the world's population?are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the bacteria that causes TB. Each year, 10.4 million fall ill from TB and 1.7 million die. There is growing resistance to available drugs, which means the disease is becoming more deadly and difficult to treat. There are 490,000 cases of MDR-TB each year. The global tuberculosis drugs market was estimated at USD 1,046 million in 2017 and is expected to reach USD 1,432 million in 2024 at a CAGR of 4.6% during the forecast period. The global first-line TB drug market ranges from approximately US$310M-316M. 
Our SME partner Apta Bharat Ltd in India is at the forefront of developing selective, novel drug molecules or inhibitors i.e. ssDNA aptamer for drug-resistant TB therapeutics and has access to the sputum samples for childhood TB. Efficient delivery of these aptamers to bacterial cells inside the lungs is crucial to delivering maximum antibacterial efficacy. RMIT researchers have developed capability in novel drug delivery systems targeted to the lungs using an advanced nebulisation platform. The overarching aim of this project is to combine the delivery capabilities of these novel nanoparticulate drug delivery systems with an advanced nebulisation platform that allows further targeting by locally delivering the drug directly to the site of infection."
Mechanical response and dynamic deformation mechanisms of closed-cell aluminium alloy foams under dynamic loading Aluminum Foam; Hölder Space; Energy Absorption The dynamic compressive response of closed-cell (CYMATâ„¢) stabilised aluminium alloy foams (SAF) has been investigated using a modified Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) in conjunction with a high-speed camera. Tests have been carried out on 45 mm diameter and 23 mm thick cylindrical specimens. The elastic-plastic pore collapse mechanism has been investigated using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and micro-computed X-ray tomography. A stress-strain relationship for individual specimens at different impact velocities has been obtained with the combination of an analytical method and SHPB theory. The large deformation (âˆ¼80%) has been measured from eight strain gaugesâ€™ data using a wave separation algorithm. The test results exhibited a significant increase in elastic and plastic strength during the pulse loading. The X-ray tomography data of pre-impacted and post-impacted SAF specimens have been extensively analysed to elucidate the internal elastic-plastic pore collapse mechanisms.
"Balancing research excellence and media impact: A multistage approach Numerosity; Number Line; Approximate The communication of research in an electronic age presents numerous opportunities to engage with the general public and/or industry that might directly benefit from new findings. The use of social media outlets typically has a narrative of better enabling connection between people, independent of distance or socio-economic factors. Recent USA-based research suggests that despite drops in the frequency of people who trust elected officials or the media to act in the best interests of the public, there remains a constant and considerably higher confidence in scientists. This suggests that direct communication from scientists can enable better public outreach on important issues. Drawing on several well-known historical examples of how high impactful science has been previously conducted and communicated, we provide a model of how combining quality peer review and a multi-stage communication strategy enables effective and constructive communication. Key to this is a capacity to engage with skilled journalists and the general public via several platforms to explain findings in an unambiguous fashion that enables translating the complexity required in a scientific journal into a digestible accurate representation. This model of research communication can enable end users to evaluate, process and apply information without filters that may intentionally bias findings."
"LDPE and Crumb Rubber in Asphalt Several types of materials are currently being recycled in roads. Among those, the most common are Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material - e.g. old asphalt roads - crumb rubber and, more recently, waste plastic. The latter has been already available in the market since decades in the form of low-crystallinity polyolefins and other thermoplastic polymers - Austroads also has one registered plastomeric-modified bitumen product named 'A35P' in its range of polymer-modified bitumen types. However it is only since recently that the need for recycling has pushed the use of recycled plastic in asphalt mixes. The use of high percentage of LDPE and HDPE in roads is commonly limited by several drawbacks such as increased temperature and reduce workability during construction operations; most importantly, plastic-modified asphalt has been largely acknowledge as to improve asphalt performance at high service temperature where high stiffness is needed but cannot provide any tangible benefit to increase the service life of the road due to poor fatigue characteristics - not being an 'elastic' elastomer limits the ability to rapidly and continuously recover from deformations due to loads (e.g. the traffic). The use of plastomeric-modified bitumen A35P is also discouraged by recent documents from Austroads and AAPA (Australian Asphalt Pavement Association) for fatigue purposes. On the other hand, crumb rubber modification of bitumen is ascribed to provide greater elasticity - even at low service temperature - hence shifting to more ductile behaviour and improved fatigue service life. High temperature issues are still to be considered though."
"Smart Modular Construction for Low Rise Residential Buildings in Australia RMIT University student Tong Lin will be undertaking a 5-month internship with ARESS ConTech Pty Ltd under the industry supervision of James Zhong and the academic mentorship of Dr Rebecca Yang. 

ARESS ConTech Pty Ltd are seeking to develop technologies to enable improved construction and supply chain
efficiencies by developing standard designs, arrangements and services connections that comply with
Australian/NZ construction standards for modular housing. If a standard can be developed that meets building
standards, any supplier will be able to design modules for individual parts of a home by simply following the standard
The first prototype tested had one house as a module. The house is 4-bed 3-bath 2-car garage double-storey house,
the most popular family size product (not a 1:1 real one, but a simulation model). In this prototype, we adopted all
AS compliant products which satisfy building compliance but had negative results from both building surveyors and
our service engineers.
For a second prototype we split our whole house module into several smaller modules and with assembly of the
house in stages to fulfil building surveyors requests which passed building compliance but did not provide the
desired supply chain and labour efficiencies.
This project involves development and certification of a third prototype to try to overcome the issues with earlier
iterations.

"CaT Pin: A Wearable to Detect Loneliness ""The number of lone-person households is increasing around the world.  While loneliness is a significant risk factor for a range of mental and physical health problems, including premature death, it can be hard to identify and offer timely interventions. The importance of word count in language acquisition, IQ and autism in children is well recognised, yet little work has been done on the use of word count as a proxy for loneliness in the elderly. Technology that is co-designed and human centred, particularly that places minimal demand on the individual to learn new procedures or interface with tablets or smart phones, offers a way to address this gap and to reduce loneliness and social isolation in older people.

The CaT Pin (Conversation as Therapy) has been developed by a multidisciplinary team working at the intersection of design, health, and technology. The pin is an outwardly conventional wearable object (e.g., a brooch) enhanced with a sensitive digital microphone and a tiny embedded microprocessor with an integrated Bluetooth low energy (BLE) transceiver. The pin monitors and processes ambient sounds surrounding the wearer in order to identify possible speech sequences within the background noise. The pin does not interpret or recognise actual content, rather it simply identifies and counts words over an interval, a significantly more straightforward problem than full speech recognition, and one that sidesteps privacy issues. The pin can be linked to real time intervention services (e.g., via SMS) and is designed to support further research activities into loneliness assessment.

We seek $4,000 to further develop the IoT system and specification web-based interface targeting user testing with Bolton Clarke staff and residents in October 2019."""

"Next generation probiotics to enhance the gut health of chickens This project aims to identify and develop strains of bacteria that have superior properties and can reliably deliver positive outcomes in the face of the variable microbiotas found in the chicken gut. Thus, this project will address the issues identified with the existing first generation probiotics that were developed before there was an understanding of the very variable microbial environment that we now know is present in the gut of chickens. This variable microbial background is likely to be a key reason why broiler growers experience variable outcomes when using first generation probiotics. A conventional probiotic that can function well in one particular gut microbial environment may not perform well within other, different, gut microbial environments."

"Inspiring Future- Oriented Graduates with Innovative Curriculum Design: Accounting in the Digital Age (Administered by University of Western Australia) Technology is rapidly evolving, changing and challenging how business is being run and the way accounting profession must deal with the technological advancements. The technology advancements have led the 21st century to be referred to as ""the digital age"" (Birt et al. 2017). Technology, and artificial intelligence, as well as Big Data, cyber currency, and cloud accounting have correspondingly recently attracted significant attention to the in accounting profession and the IAESB (2018). Technology evolution will impact on the digital age skills required by accounting graduates, which may require transforming accounting and finance education. ""Graduates will be solution architects, problem solvers, data analysts, design thinkers and storytellers, Muldowney, 2018"". As a response to dramatic technological changes particularly in information technology over the past century, our study is motivated to investigate innovative approaches in embedding technology into accounting curriculum with a focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, Big Data, XBRL, cyber currency accounting, Blockchain and cloud accounting. Currently the International Accounting Education Standard Board's (IAESB) Conceptual Framework and International Education Standards (IESs) comprise some examples of Information Communication Technology (ICT) elements. This includes reference to some technology concepts relevant to education in part 2 of the Framework 2015. "

"A proton flow reactor system for large-scale electrical energy storage and bulk export of hydrogenated carbon based material In this project we are developing an integrated system for medium and grid-scale storage of renewable energy and exporting it as hydrogen within hydrogenated carbon-based media. A novel `proton flow reactor? system for producing hydrogenated carbon(C)-based powder for bulk export will be developed. The reactor employs electricity from renewables to charge a flowing `slurry electrode? of C-particles with hydrogen. Hydrogen, as protons, is obtained by water splitting. Solid hydrogenated C-powder for storage and transport is generated by removing the liquid. At the destination, this C-powder is reconverted into a slurry and passed through a similar reactor operating in `fuel-cell? mode to re-generate electricity. This system will be a scaled-up form of RMIT?s novel proton battery ? a reversible PEM fuel cell that reversibly stores protons in its solid electrode without forming hydrogen gas. The technical feasibility of a proton battery with an activated carbon electrode has recently been proven by the RMIT team. Importantly the system may open up an alternative market for Australian coal that has no adverse greenhouse gas impact. The efficiency and levelised cost of delivered energy will be assessed, and a roadmap for scale-up and commercialisation developed."

"Business breakfast/Business around the Table In order to facilitate industry engagement and effective collaboration of academic staff it is proposed to run two types of events (1) Business breakfast and (2) ?Business Around the Table?. Both approach come from the best business practice. Underpinning philosophy of both is social learning process, which proposes that new behaviors can be acquired by observing and imitating others. It states that learning is a cognitive process that takes place in a social context and can occur purely through observation. This process is especially effective when motivation is enhanced and stimulated through effective social communication. 

The engagement and collaboration with industry and the tertiary sector will be based on a bespoke, tailored business practice. For instance business leaders will be invited from resources companies like RioTinto, BHP Billiton, AMIRA International, Shell Global to discuss various challenges industry face. 

When participants involved in learning about common problems (in this case industry problems), this lead to moral development, involves the ability of individuals to make judgments aside self-interest, the ability to take perspective of others, regardless of how these may affect ones own personal interests or values, learning how to co-operate with others. When applied within a high education context, the process of Social Learning engenders an understanding of civic responsibility to industry and community in society large. Ultimately it will lead to innovation and collaboration culture within the organisation. "

"Rent city: Prospects for high-density liveability in new housing tenures This project aims to assess how the rapid rise of a new housing tenure of large vertical high-density rental homes
transforms urban communities and neighbourhoods. Purpose-built rental apartments (Build-to-Rent) are a new
fast-growing housing product in Australia yet their implications for urban liveability have not been systematically
evaluated. This first study of this burgeoning industry sector and of Build-to-Rent households will provide essential
evidence on the opportunities and risks posed by rental housing financialisation to inform apartment design and
governance. Outcomes include policy proposals, allowing urban stakeholders to improve private rental futures for
urban households, amidst growing housing precariousness in Australia."
"Examining sleep and mood in parents of children with sleep disturbances Sleep Latency; Autism; Slow Wave Sleep Objective: The current study examined sleep and mood associations in parents of children with sleep disturbances across a sample of typically developing children and children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The mediating effect of childrenâ€™s sleep on the relationship between parentsâ€™ sleep and mood was also assessed. The study explored differences in parentsâ€™ sleep based on whether 1) the child had a sleep disturbance, and 2) the child was typically developing or had a neurodevelopmental disorder. Methods: A total of 293 parents of children aged 2â€“12 years completed an online questionnaire. Parental sleep was examined using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Glasgow Sleep Effort Scale and the Pre-sleep Arousal Scale, and mood was assessed using the Profile of Mood States-short form. Measures for children included the Childâ€™s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results: Across the overall sample, childrenâ€™s sleep disturbances were associated with parentsâ€™ sleep disturbances, accounting for 22% of the change in parental sleep quality. Childrenâ€™s sleep partially mediated parentsâ€™ sleep and mood. Significant differences were observed for sleep and mood outcomes in parents of children with sleep disturbances (CSHQ scores â‰¥41). However, no significant differences were reported for childrenâ€™s sleep disturbances and parentsâ€™ sleep quality based on whether the child was typically developing or had a neurodevelopmental disorder. Conclusion: Parents of children with sleep disturbances experience poor sleep and high presleep arousal, indicative of insomnia. Given that these parents experience cognitive arousal and insomnia, it is recommended that parentsâ€™ sleep problems are addressed and treated in clinical settings."
"Key steps to aid the recovery of the endangered karak (red-tailed black cockatoo) and buloke (bull oak) in south-eastern Australia The long-term aims of this project in the Wimmera region in south-eastern Australia are:
1. To support efforts to provide food for the nationally endangered karak (Red-tailed black cockatoo) (Calyptorhynchus banksiigraptogyne) in south-eastern Australia. Karak have a declining population of only 660 breeding individuals and occur only in a contiguous area of 18,000 ha in south-eastern Australia. Its food supply is seasonal seed of two stringybarks (9 months) and buloke (3 months) in a 2-4 year cycle.

2. To support efforts to augment buloke (Allocasuarina luehmannii) of the nationally endangered. `Buloke Woodlands ??.. Bioregions?. Buloke woodlands have declined by 97% due to land-clearing for agriculture and most buloke trees are now scattered in paddocks and roadsides. Seed is produced only by female trees. Karak prefer to forage in high cone-producing trees >100 years old. Food supply is a major limitation on karak populations. Unless more buloke is planted in private farms, the karak food supply will decline as older trees die."

"Novel bioremediation tools for nitrogen contaminated groundwater Groundwater contamination with nitrogen (nitrates, ammonia and organic nitrogen) is a global issue reducing the
quality of groundwater and restricting its use (WHO, 2011). The current standard approaches for nitrogen remediation
of groundwater are costly and invasive with water being brought to the surface and treated ex situ before replacement
in the aquifer.

The proposed project will investigate augmenting natural attenuation and bioremediating nitrogen contaminated
groundwater in situ. The research has three modules:

Module 1: Assess why current natural attention in selected aquifers is ineffective over 2 years.

Module 2: Use RMIT mesocosms to test the effects of carbon sources and concentrations, indigenous vs. added
microbes to environmental variables ( pH, salinity) to improve bioremediation.

Module 3: Test the preferred approaches from 1 and 2 on in situ aquifers impacted by the water industry in year 3."

"Social Mix: Measuring the benefits for low-income households Social mix, by including social housing tenures in private developments, is a widely used mechanism for improving housing affordability and access to social housing. Yet there is little evidence about its benefits despite growing interest in mechanisms such as inclusionary zoning. This research project will deliver a baseline of practitioner and resident perspectives about what works in socially mixed housing developments, using Nightingale Village as a case study. The project will document and examine the management and delivery of the social mix approach at Nightingale Village, evaluate the likely population diversity outcomes, and document the perspectives of prospective residents. The study will use quantitative and qualitative methods. Secondary data will provide a baseline social mix of population diversity at the neighbourhood scale and a projected social mix outcome once complete. Interviews with project developers and community housing providers will gather data about the delivery model and approach, and with prospective residents about their perceptions. The findings will provide an evidence base about the application of social mix principles in a purposeful development and to what extent social mix contributes to more diverse and equitable housing outcomes. These findings will provide lessons to industry and communities to inform future projects."
"Low-Cost Portable Inhalation Therapy Platform for Needle-Free DNA-Based Influenza Vaccination The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that influenza causes between 3 and 5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000?500,000 deaths annually.1 In Australia, influenza is associated with 1,500?2,500 deaths annually. In addition to loss of life, influenza outbreaks represent a significant healthcare burden and cost to both industry and individuals. Due to needle aversion, less than ideal efficacy and an inability to safely or effectively vaccinate some groups of patients (immunocompromised individuals), there is considerable need to investigate alternative influenza vaccine strategies. The proposed research aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost handheld nebulisation platform for efficient pulmonary influenza vaccination we have developed, which could significantly transform strategies for effective global vaccination."

"Solar Reforming of Plastic using Ligand-Free Gold Nanoparticles Plastics have found broad application in society due to their versatile properties and low cost, but their use has created a disposal challenge. Eight million tons of plastic enter the oceans every year, and marine plastic pollution is predicted to outweigh the fish in the oceans by 2050. Although recycling is increasingly prevalent, a third of all plastic is still too small or complex to recover economically. A potential solution is to use plastic waste as a feedstock for solar fuel generation.  Recently, Dr Moritz Kuehnel demonstrated the generation of hydrogen from plastic feedstocks using sunlight. Semiconductor nanomaterials, known as quantum dots, were used to harness solar energy to photoreform common plastics. Although a promising `green? technology, the biotoxicity of cadmium and the harsh operating conditions limits the large-scale application of this method.
Gold nanoparticles represent another nanomaterial that can direct light energy toward catalytic processes, in addition to being bio-compatible. However, gold nanoparticles have molecules bound to their surfaces, known as ligands, which stabilise them, preventing the nanoparticles from aggregating and degrading their nanoscale properties. Ligand molecules present a physical barrier to plastic molecules accessing the surface of nanoparticles which hinders the nanoparticles? ability to catalyse the conversion of plastic into solar fuels. Dr Steven Barrow is currently pioneering a novel method of synthesising gold nanoparticles in the absence of ligand molecules. Dr Barrow has shown that these `ligand-free? nanoparticles demonstrate unique interactions with organic molecules and has shown that they can catalyse reactions that are inaccessible to their ligand-stabilised counterparts. This highlights their potential in the photoreforming of plastic, an application for which gold nanoparticles have yet to be utilised.

"The role of microglia in mediating the neuroendocrine responses in diet-induced obesity Obesity induces inflammation, making it harder to lose weight and increasing the risk for long-term health complications. Recent data suggest microglia, the brain major immune cells, may play a key role in driving the detrimental consequences of obesity. I will test if microglia are necessary for the development of obesity. This will tell us if by targeting the neuroimmune consequences of diets high in fat, we are able to restore healthy weight and curb obesity."
"Simultaneous optimisation of residence time, heat and mass transfer in laminar duct flows Chaotic Advection; Passive Scalar; Liquid Suitably designed laminar duct flows admit chaotic advection which, in concert with diffusion, can lead to rapid heat and mass transport and sharpening of the residence time distribution (RTD). Whilst evolution of these distinct scalar fields are strongly related, the exact relationships between these distinct fields is unknown, nor to what extent they can be simultaneously optimised. In this paper we present a unified framework for the simultaneous optimisation of the three scalar fields; RTD, temperature, and mass concentration. This optimisation is performed in terms of the eigenmodes of the advection-diffusion operator, which generalize classical Taylor-Aris axial dispersion. We apply this optimisation framework to a twisted pipe flow (TPF) at PÃ©clet number Pe=105, and find 47- and 237-fold increases in transverse heat and mass transfer respectively over straight tube flow, along with a 2,000-fold suppression of RTD variance growth. We show that generality of the eigenmode decomposition suggests this framework is universal to all duct flows."

"Podocalyxin inhibits human embryo implantation in vitro and luminal podocalyxin in putative receptive endometrium is associated with implantation failure in fertility treatment Nidation; Implantation; Endometrium Objective: To study whether endometrial epithelial podocalyxin (PCX) inhibits implantation of human embryos in vitro and in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Design: We have recently identified PCX as a key negative regulator of endometrial epithelial receptivity. Podocalyxin is expressed in all epithelial cells in the nonreceptive endometrium, but is selectively downregulated in the luminal epithelium (LE) for receptivity. In the current study, we first investigated whether high levels of PCX in Ishikawa monolayer inhibit attachment and/or penetration of human blastocysts in in vitro models. We then examined PCX by immunohistochemistry in putative receptive endometrial tissues biopsied from 81 IVF patients who underwent frozen embryo transfer in the next natural cycle and retrospectively analyzed the association between PCX staining in LE and clinical pregnancy as a proxy of successful implantation. Setting: RMIT University, Australia; Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium. Patient(s): In vitro fertilization patients undergoing frozen/thawed embryo transfer. Intervention(s): N/A. Main Outcome Measure(s): Endometrial epithelial PCX inhibits implantation of human embryos in vitro and in IVF patients. Result(s): High levels of PCX in Ishikawa monolayer significantly inhibited blastocyst attachment and penetration. Among the 81 putative receptive tissues, 73% were negative, but 27% were heterogeneously positive for PCX in LE. The clinical pregnancy rate was 53% in those with a PCX-negative LE but only 18% in those with a PCX-positive LE. If LE was positive for PCX, the odds ratio of no clinical pregnancy was 4.95 (95% Confidence interval, 1.48â€“14.63). Conclusion(s): Podocalyxin inhibits embryo implantation. Assessment of PCX may aid the evaluation and optimization of endometrial receptivity in fertility treatment."

"Why join a sustainable neighbourhood group? An examination of the motives of group members in Lake Macquarie The aim of this exploratory research project is to investigate the motives and demographic characteristics of people who are members of sustainable neighbourhood groups (SNG’s) in Lake Macquarie. Motives are understood in this study as being “the implicit or explicit
manifestation of an individual and or/collectives drive or wish to do (or not do) something in a particular context” (Perez-Arrendondo, 2019, p. 239). Specifically, the study will explore the similarities and differences between the representations of these motives, and how the study participants position themselves and others both as individuals and as members of a sustainable neighbourhood group, to examine if there are common or shared characteristics and motivations of people who join or form a SNG."
"After the Apocalypse: The Mediasphere, Global Crisis and Violent Ecologies This project examines the ways in which the media shapes our thinking and practices around crisis and violence. Deviating from conventional approaches to natural or human catastrophe, the study aims to generate an original theory of crisis and its formation in contemporary  culture. The study focuses particularly on the evolution of a 'crisis consciousness' and the ways in which human desires are implicated in the cultural politics of violence. The study will contribute to scholarly and public understanding of violence, particularly through Australia's engagement in the global 'war on terror'. The study will offer new insights into the nature of crisis and violence, and the possibilities for peace and reconciliation."
"A New Cumulative Anomaly-Based Model for the Detection of Heavy Precipitation Using GNSS-Derived Tropospheric Products Precipitable Water; Global Positioning System; GNSS In recent years, tropospheric products obtained from ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements, especially the zenith total delay (ZTD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) estimates, have advanced their usages in meteorological applications such as the detection of precipitation events. Generally, a cumulative anomaly (CA) time series of any atmospheric variable, which represents the long-term departure of the variable from its 'normal' cycle, is widely used for quantitatively estimating the variable's variations in response to a weather event. In this study, a new cumulative anomaly-based model (NCAM) containing 14 variables, including not only PWV and ZTD values but also their respective six types of derivatives, for detecting heavy precipitation was developed. The 6-h CA time series of the variables were calculated based on the data of hourly precipitation records and time series of ZTD and PWV collected at the co-located HKSC-King's Park (KP) stations over the eight-year period 2010-2017. The model was evaluated using the 14 variables' CA time series to detect heavy precipitation events happened in the summer months over the period 2018-2019, and precipitation records in the same period were used as the reference. Results demonstrated that 99.1% of heavy precipitation was correctly detected by the NCAM with a lead time of 2.87 h, and the false alarm ratio (FAR) score resulting from the model was reduced to 22.4%. In addition, two case studies were also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the NCAM. These results all provide a promising direction for the application of using the CA time series of GNSS tropospheric products to the detection of heavy precipitation events."

"Australian undergraduate information systems curricula: A comparative study Job Posting; Curricula; Graduate The paper describes the first comprehensive comparative study of undergraduate Information Systems (IS) degree programs in Australia using the model curricula outlined in ACM/AIS IS2010 as a reference point. The study had three broad aims: 1) to compare the Australian IS curriculum with that of other major IS education systems internationally, 2) to identify what subject areas are considered mandatory and what are considered optional in Australian IS programs, and 3) to understand if the host academic division within different disciplines (e.g. Business or Science/Engineering/Information Technology) has an influence on the variations in the subject areas offered. In a first phase, 2017 IS degree program data was obtained from university websites. In a second phase, this data was validated in consultation with academic staff from those universities offering the programs. The conclusion is that a high level of adherence to the IS2010 curricula was evident in core courses; considerable diversity was found in a long tail of non-core offerings; and the location of the host academic unit within Business or Science/Engineering/Technology influenced the subject areas offered."

"Development of immunological assays to
assist the control of Spotty Liver Disease in
chickens Spotty Liver Disease causes serious issues for the Australian Poultry Industry. Thanks to PHA support, we have investigated a large number of birds for C. hepaticus active infection using PCR. To further understand the epidemiology of SLD we propose to use bird serology to detect antibodies against C. hepaticus; thus detect not only active but also previous infections. We propose development of innovative immunological assays to detect C. hepaticus antibodies and antigens in birds, by testing three approaches; (i) a whole cells antigen ELISA, (ii) an ELISA based on recombinant immunodominant antigens and (iii) monoclonal-based ELISA to detect circulating antigen."
"Diamond scanning probe for characterization of topological insulators As a new state of matter, Topological Insulators (TI) with insulating bulk but conducting surface states are recognized as the key for the implementation of low power consumption devices for high‐performance and low power electronics, and quantum computing. To identify the full potential of TI materials, characterization and modelling of TI are needed. In this project, we will develop a full optical method to
characterize TI. Our approach takes advantage of scanning quantum probe type technology. Because of the unique electromagnetic boundary conditions of Tl relate the electric and magnetic fields at the surface of the TI, we monitor the change in far‐field fluorescence from a single dipole as a function of the type of material: conductor vs insulator vs TI. The interference is due to interactions between the dipole and the effective mirror dipole inside and outside the material. We propose to use diamond pillars or nanodiamonds with single color centers, initially concentrating on the nitrogen‐vacancy (NV) color center, to develop a robust scanning optical tool to characterize and identify TI. This technique has the potential of being fast and able to scan wide areas (typically hundreds of microns) with spatial resolution around the tens to hundred nanometer level. Another useful readout information of our method to characterize TI will use the magnetic sensing capability of NV centers to characterize the magnetic field response of TI to electric fields, since a magnetic field arises when an electric field is applied near the surface due to the special electromagnetic boundary properties of Tl. Our proposed method, based on novel electromagnetic modelling and scanning diamond probe technology, promises new insights into the characterization and optimization of materials for TI‐based devices.

"Invertebrate Use of Rooftops in Melbourne Our proposed research will monitor biodiversity impacts of the construction of two new green roof retrofits in Melbourne CBD: the demonstration green roof on 1 Treasury Place and the Melbourne Skyfarm on Siddeley Carpark. These two rooftops represent unique case studies in green roof installation and design considering their spatial context (particularly proximity to large ground-level parks) and design objectives (primarily research and urban agriculture, respectively). We will measure invertebrate diversity, abundance and utilisation on each of these roof sites as well as bare roofs, green roofs and ground sites in the vicinity of each of these new developments, both before and after construction. This provides a unique opportunity to establish and utilise baseline data on roof use by animals to understand questions of habitat use, colonisation, and roof-roof interactions. Surveying the target roofs before the installation of the green infrastructure and collecting information about the species using surrounding roofs after installation will provide detailed information about the additional biodiversity benefits green roofs can deliver in highly urbanised environment. Thus, the findings of our study can be used to better integrate biodiversity and green infrastructure planning."
"Designing green spaces for biodiversity and human well-being There is now abundant evidence linking biodiversity to the liveability of cities and the health and well-being of urban residents. Yet the best ways to encourage biodiversity using urban design are poorly understood and almost nothing is known about the characteristics of green space that deliver health and well-being outcomes.
This project aims to determine the mechanisms linking urban design to the socio-ecological benefits derived from
green spaces. Results of this study will improve the design of green space in cities around the world."

"Electrochemical Stability of Zinc and Copper Surfaces in Protic Ionic Liquids Lubricants; Ionic Liquids; Friction Ionic liquids are versatile solvents that can be tailored through modification of the cation and anion species. Relatively little is known about the corrosive properties of protic ionic liquids. In this study, we have explored the corrosion of both zinc and copper within a series of protic ionic liquids consisting of alkylammonium or alkanolammonium cations paired with nitrate or carboxylate anions along with three aprotic imidazolium ionic liquids for comparison. Electrochemical studies revealed that the presence of either carboxylate anions or alkanolammonium cations tend to induce a cathodic shift in the corrosion potential. The effect in copper was similar in magnitude for both cations and anions, while the anion effect was slightly more pronounced than that of the cation in the case of zinc. For copper, the presence of carboxylate anions or alkanolammonium cations led to a notable decrease in corrosion current, whereas an increase was typically observed for zinc. The ionic liquid-metal surface interactions were further explored for select protic ionic liquids on copper using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to characterize the interface. From these studies, the oxide species formed on the surface were identified, and copper speciation at the surface linked to ionic liquid and potential dependent surface passivation. Density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the ethanolammonium cation was more strongly bound to the copper surface than the ethylammonium counterpart. In addition, the nitrate anion was more tightly bound than the formate anion. These likely lead to competing effects on the process of corrosion: the tightly bound cations act as a source of passivation, whereas the tightly bound anions facilitate the electrodissolution of the copper."

"Developing novel drug delivery strategies to target myeloid reservoirs of HIV in the brain A major barrier to curing HIV is the persistence of the virus in tissue sites such as the brain where anti-HIV drugs have limited ability to penetrate. HIV persistence in the central nervous system (CNS) is thought to contribute to ~50% of people living with HIV (PLWH) developing a form of cognitive impairment and may be related to the poor penetrance of anti-HIV drugs into the CNS. Therefore, new therapies and/or treatment strategies are required to deliver anti-HIV drugs to the brain. In this project we will develop and validate a
novel drug delivery molecule that binds to and directly delivers anti-HIV drugs to HIV-infected cells in the brain. Targeted drug delivery to the brain may improve drug efficacy, reduce risk of drug toxicity and reduce the role of HIV in driving neurocognitive disorders, thus improving outcomes for PLWH."

"Distributed algorithm for solving linear algebraic equations: An implicit gradient neural network approach Distributed Optimization; Method of Multipliers; Parallel Algorithms This brief investigates the online solving problem for linear algebraic equation Ax = b by means of the principle of consensus in multi-agent systems, where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. To be specific, we choose m autonomous agents and agent i knows only the i- th row of [A b] under a fixed and connected undirected communication topology. Under local interactions, by designing an implicit gradient neural network based algorithm, it is shown that all the agents' states which starting from any different initial conditions can converge exponentially fast to one of the solutions to Ax = b, if the matrix A has full row rank. It is worth noting that the proposed algorithm is fully distributed. In addition, it is shown that the proposed algorithm is effective in obtaining least square solutions for no-solution cases. Finally, computer simulations verify and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods for solving linear algebraic equations."

"On the FPV Property, Monotone Operator Structure and the Monotone Polar of Representable Monotone Sets Monotone Operator; Subdifferential; Maximal We study the pointwise partial ordering of representative functions for a monotone operator and in particular we focus on the bigger conjugate representative functions that represent a fixed initial (non-maximal) monotone operator. The first problem considered is that of constructing a new representative function from a given member of this class when wanting to add an additional monotonically related point. This study allows us to prove that all bigger conjugate representable monotone sets are monotonically closed. This result sheds light on the structure of the domains for maximal monotone operators and enables us to study the sum theorem for FPV operators in Banach spaces which posses a dual space that has a strictly convex renorm."

"Smoothing topology optimization results using pre-built lookup tables Topology Optimization; Numerical Methods; Compliant Mechanisms Topology optimization techniques are typically performed on a design domain discretized with finite element meshes to generate efficient and innovative structural designs. The optimized structural topologies usually exhibit zig-zag boundaries formed from straight element edges. Existing techniques to obtain smooth structural topologies are limited. Most methods are computationally expensive, as they are performed iteratively with topology optimization. Other methods, such as post-processing methods, are applied after topology optimization, but they cannot guarantee to obtain equivalent structural designs, as the volume and geometric features may be changed. This study presents a new method that uses pre-built lookup tables to transform the shape of boundary elements obtained from topology optimization to create smoothed structural topologies. The new method is developed based on the combination of the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique and marching geometries to determine structural topologies and lookup tables, respectively. An additional step is used to ensure that the generated result meets a target volume. A variety of 2D and 3D examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method. This research shows that the new method is highly efficient, as it can be directly added to the last step of topology optimization with a low computational cost, and the volume and geometric features can be preserved in smoothed topologies. Finite element models are also created for original and smoothed structural topologies to show that the structural stiffness can be significantly enhanced after smoothing."

"Economic insecurity and gambling behaviours in Victoria in the COVID-19 society. COVID-19 has led to economic chaos across the globe with effects on financial markets, businesses and millions of households. The aim of this project is to understand the complex relationships between economic insecurity and gambling behaviours. The linkages between the macroeconomic environment and personal economic insecurity impact on individual health and wellbeing and can act as a trigger for gambling behaviours.
This project will explore these connections using a unique longitudinal dataset collected over a single calendar year, 2021. The purpose of the study is to establish how, and the channels through which: i) economic insecurity in the global economy, and ii) personal economic positions, work as leading antecedents of gambling harm. We will explore actual and perceived economic positions. COVID-19 has created economic uncertainty for many people including those still in active employment or those who have not suffered immediate loss; understanding the role of perceived (as well as actual) insecurity in promoting gambling harm is very important."

"Reading in the Mallee: The Literary Past and Future of an Australian Region (administered by Deakin University) Led by Deakin University. This project will explore the capacity of local reading practices to challenge narrow narratives of Australian regions, and to generate diverse, dynamic and inclusive accounts of community and place identity. Taking the Mallee in Victoria – an iconic and emblematic region in the Australian cultural imaginary – as exemplar, the project will innovate as it centralises both historic and contemporary reader-generated knowledge in the making of regional literary history, and brings participatory methods drawn from literary and creative practice into this process. The project will build capacity for local readers and literary stakeholders in the region, diversify available narratives of the Mallee, and enhance regional literary infrastructure."
"Combining laboratory and computational approaches to develop reliable low cost HIV prognostics HIV entry into immune system cells involves engagement of cell-surface CCR5 or CXCR4 receptor. 'CCR5 antagonist' anti-HIV drugs, such as maraviroc (MVC), bind to CCR5 and block entry of CCR5-using (R5) HIV strains. Because CCR5 antagonists are contraindicated in patients harbouring CXCR4-using viruses, a pre-treatment laboratory prognostic test (called TrofileTM) is required to determine patient's HIV receptor usage. However, the cost, long turn-around time, and specialised nature of TrofileTM have limited patient access to CCR5 antagonists worldwide.

In response, relatively cheap, rapid in silico HIV genetic sequence-based prognostics have been developed. However, these have been developed specifically for HIV subtype B viruses, which account for 10% of infections. In this study, I will develop and clinically validate the first suite of in silico prognostics specific for each of the major HIV subtypes that account for >95% of infections worldwide. Some R5 HIV strains can acquire resistance to CCR5 antagonists by acquiring the ability to engage drug-bound CCR5. Unfortunately, the only prognostic for R5 HIV resistance to CCR5 antagonists is an expensive and time-consuming laboratory test. In this study, I will establish and perform extensive molecular studies on a large panel of longitudinal HIV clones from patients who failed MVC treatment due to emergence of resistant R5 viruses. These data will inform the development of the first in silico HIV genetic sequence-based prognostics for determining (i) R5 HIV resistance to MVC (and other CCR5 antagonists), and (ii) whether patient?s HIV is ?predisposed? to become MVC resistant thus contraindicating therapy. I expect these novel prognostics, informed by my molecular studies, will improve patient access to MVC and other CCR5 antagonists, and treatment outcome, in particular for patients residing in resource-constrained regions where non-B HIV predominate, and which are burdened most by the pandemic."

"Macroscale superlubricity of Si-doped diamond-like carbon film enabled by graphene oxide as additives Diamond Like Carbon Films; Amorphous Carbon; Carbon Carbon-based materials including diamond-like carbon (DLC) and graphene have been demonstrated as extraordinary lubricating materials due to its specific structure and weakness of the interlayer interactions. In this work, the extreme coefficient of friction (COF = 0.002) was achieved on the silicon-doped hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H:Si) film by lubrication with graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets as additives in ethylene glycol. The tribochemical reactions occurred on the Si3N4 surface and a-C:H:Si film, leading to the formation of the silica colloid layer on both Si3N4 and a-C:H:Si surfaces. In the meantime, the physical adsorption of GO nanosheets on the friction surfaces makes the shear plane transfer from Si3N4/a-C:H:Si interface to GO/GO interface, which results in a further reduction of shear stress. The mechanism and modelling of a-C:H:Si and GO nanosheets synergistic lubrication effect was finally established to reveal the design principle of superlubricity at macroscale."

"Defining HIV-1 Reservoirs in the Central Nervous System HIV-1 cannot be eradicated by combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) alone. The major obstacle to eradicating HIV-1 is the ability of intact and replication competent proviral DNA to persist latently in cellular reservoirs. Long-lived memory T cells are the best studied latent HIV reservoir, and virus from this reservoir will rebound when patients stop therapy. In addition to the T cell reservoir, there is considerable evidence demonstrating that HIV can also persist within tissues including the gut, lungs, kidneys, lymph nodes and potentially the central nervous system (CNS). Despite there being a significant and extensive knowledge base regarding HIV infection of the CNS and the development of neurological disorders in HIV infected viremic individuals, there is only a very limited understanding of the mechanisms of persistence in the CNS following viral suppression. Understanding the magnitude of intact and replication competent HIV-1 genomes within the CNS, and the cell types comprising the reservoir is paramount to the design of safe and effective eradication strategies. Our proposal will comprehensively characterise the CNS reservoir of HIV-1 using state-of-the-art novel in situ imaging approaches in clinically relevant human samples. These studies will provide conclusive information regarding the frequency, phenotype and anatomical location of HIV-infected cells and the magnitude of the CNS reservoir in relation to peripheral lymphoid compartments. Further, we will determine the proportion of the reservoir that contains intact genomes and the capacity of the virus to replicate and rebound, potentially leading to reseeding of infection."

"Investigating Space Requirements in Schools Victoria has a long reputation as Australia?s Education State.  It is imperative that the Victorian Department of Education and Training (DET) to support high quality, contemporary Victorian schools that can improve and grow positive outcomes for Victorian students. 
With recent population and density increases, current and emerging pedagogy, constraints on land and capital, changing community expectations, and the emergence of fit-for-purpose space, there is a need for alternative school building models. These alternative models include vertical builds, multi campuses, and `cluster? schools (multiple schools in the one location).
DET and the Victoria School Building Authority (VSBA) want a better understanding of how modern design principles and international best practice could be deployed to support provision planning for new school capacity in established areas. Research is required to determine the opportunities and / or constraints of alternative school building models.
Our solution:
KPMG will create a research report to better inform the Department and relevant stakeholders as to how it can deliver school infrastructure to a growing population whilst maintaining and continually improving pedagogical outcomes, learning and teaching experience and sustainable, effective design within the constraints and practicalities of building in high density suburbs and cities.

"Enhancing voltage regulation in DC microgrids using a price incentive load management approach Microgrid; DC-DC Converter; Electric Potential This paper studies the voltage regulation problem in DC microgrids in the presence of variable loads. DC microgrids generally include several Distributed Generation Units (DGUs), connected to electrical loads through DC power lines. The variable nature of loads at each spot, caused for example by moving electric vehicles, may cause voltage deregulation in the grid. To reduce this undesired effect, this study proposes an incentive-based load management strategy to balance the loads connected to the grid. The electricity price at each node of the grid is considered to be dependent on its voltage. This guide moving customers to connect to cheaper connection points, and ultimately results in even load distribution. Simulations show the improvement in the voltage regulation, power loss, and efficiency of the grid even when only a small portion of customers accept the proposed incentive."
"Plastic Repurpose for Indigenous Australia  Dr de Waal and his team of students obtained the design blueprints to build the extrusion machine, compression machine and an injection machine and they need funding to do this in semester 2, 2018. A project web site has been set up at https://www.plasticrepurpose.org/. However, part of his students’ project tasks this semester was to determine the best course of action in terms of ‘buy or make’ decision. Unlike the case with the shredder, it is not important to have these machines self-produced, so they are looking at obtaining the required performance at the best possible price from China.  His students’ report is due on 1 June when the decision shall be made whether to make or build the remaining machines. Ready for purchase machines are not available in Australia but are available off-the-shelf from China and should this be the best option it will reduce the lead time to establishing their pilot plant. If the decision is to build the machines the funding will be used to contract Make & Create to assist Gerrit’s students in completing the rest of the pilot plant. If the decision is to procure the team shall order the machines from China and conduct initial test runs to experiment and demonstrate the functionality and performance of the machines and to document the integrated processes. ‘Proof of concept’ is very important as some technical and operational challenges are anticipated that must be satisfactory addressed before the team can commission production plants elsewhere. The pilot plant will be operational by the end of November 2018 and a baseline business model will be ready at the same time to deliver production plants to operators in regional communities and train them."

"Impact Analysis about Response Time Considering Deployment Change of SaaS Software Virtual Machine; Data Center; Cloud Computing The deployment change of SaaS (Software as a Service) software will influence its response time, which is an important performance metric. Therefore, studying the impact of deployment change on the response time of SaaS software could contribute to performance improvement of the software. However, there are few performance analysis methods which can directly analyze the relationship between deployment change and response time of SaaS software. In this paper, we propose an approach which provides the impact analysis of specific deployment change operations on response time of SaaS software explicitly. Specifically, we present an evaluation method for the response time of SaaS software in specific deployment scheme by leveraging queueing theory. With mathematical derivation based on the proposed evaluation method, we qualitatively analyze the variation trend of response time with respect to deployment change. Furthermore, we study the relationship between two specific types of deployment change operations and response time variation of SaaS software, which is used to propose a response time improvement method based on deployment change. Finally, the effectiveness of the analysis conclusions and the proposed method in this paper is validated by practical cases, which indicates that adjusting deployment scheme according to the conclusions obtained in this paper can be helpful in improving the response time of SaaS software."

It is a gynaecological disorder in which the endometrial cells that normally form the inner lining of the uterus grow outside of their natural location, most commonly on the ovaries, pelvic walls and other organs (such as the bowel). This abnormal growth induces chronic inflammation and crippling pain. In addition, endometriosis is commonly associated with infertility."
"AI-enabled sub-ppb NO2 and NH3 biomarker gas detection in agriculture crops for precision and smart farming. (Candidate: Van Ham Ha) Gas sensors are essential in several industries such as agricultural, biomedical, manufacturing, petroleum
industry, among others. In precision agriculture, food wastage is a severe issue which in 2017 had an
estimated loss of $20B to the Australian economy.[1] According to the National Food Waste Baseline
Report (2019), 25% of produce is estimated never to leave the farm, costing Australian farmers $2.84B
annually.[2] Food wastage can also occur at other stages, such as manufacturing, storage, and supply chain.
NO2 and NH3 biomarkers exerted by the fresh produce can determine the quality of the produce before
spoilage. These biomarkers measured in sub-part-per-billion (ppb) can provide crucial information about
the produce's condition as an early detection tool for efficient produce management throughout the supply
chain. However, achieving the biomarker detection in sub-ppb range requires costly specialised
instruments that are non-economical in large-scale agriculture."

"Marine Bile Natural Products as Agonists of the TGR5 Receptor Obeticholic Acid; Bile Acids and Salts; Farnesoid X-Activated Receptor Agonism of the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor ""Takeda G-protein receptor 5""(TGR5) aids in attenuating cholesterol accumulation due to atherosclerotic progression. Although mammalian bile compounds can activate TGR5, they are generally weak agonists, and more effective compounds need to be identified. In this study, two marine bile compounds (5Î²-scymnol and its sulfate) were compared with mammalian bile compounds deoxycholic acid (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) using an in vitro model of TGR5 agonism. The response profiles of human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) transfected to overexpress TGR5 (HEK293-TGR5) and incubated with subcytotoxic concentrations of test compounds were compared to nontransfected HEK293 control cells using the specific calcium-binding fluorophore Fura-2AM to measure intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i release. Scymnol and scymnol sulfate caused a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i within TGR5 cells only, which was abolished by a specific inhibitor for GÎ±q protein (UBO-QIC). Sustained increases in [Ca2+]i were seen in both cell types with DCA exposure; this was unaffected by UBO-QIC, indicating that TGR5 activation was not involved. Exposure to UDCA did not alter [Ca2+]i, suggesting a lack of TGR5 bioactivity. These findings demonstrated that both scymnol and scymnol sulfate are novel agonists of TGR5 receptors, showing therapeutic potential for treating atherosclerosis."

"Stress-strain model for FRP-confined concrete subject to arbitrary load path Axial Compression; Polymers; Jackets Most existing stress-strain models for fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) confined concrete are applicable to monotonic loading or complete cyclic loading where unloading/reloading is a continuous process between envelope curve and zero stress. However, load cycling is mostly incomplete or partial in practical problems where reverse of loading occurs before the previous load cycle is completed, and this unloading and reloading process is random. Cyclic model allowing for random partial load cycling is rare, if any, due to the lack of experimental data, and the insufficient understanding on the behavior of confined concrete under partial cyclic loading. In this study, FRP confined concrete cylinders were tested under six typical cyclic load patterns. The test results reveal that the partial cyclic stress-strain behavior is different from that under full cyclic loading. The key parameters determining unloading/reloading curves, such as reloading modulus, plastic strain, and tangent unloading modulus are related to loading history and axial stress level. It is found that the key parameters will change, or accumulative damage to concrete will occur, only under certain condition which is defined as effective partial cyclic loading in this work. A simple method is proposed to define the effective partial cyclic loading. Based on an existing complete cyclic model, a stress-strain model for FRP confined concrete under random partial cyclic loading is developed in this work. The proposed model performs well under different load patterns."

"Cross-Layer Multi-Cloud Real-Time Application QoS Monitoring and Benchmarking As-a-Service Framework Service Level Agreement; Quality Of Service; Cloud Computing Cloud computing provides on-demand access to affordable hardware (e.g., multi-core CPUs, GPUs, disks, and networking equipment) and software (e.g., databases, application servers and data processing frameworks) platforms with features such as elasticity, pay-per-use, low upfront investment and low time to market. This has led to the proliferation of business critical applications that leverage various cloud platforms. Such applications hosted on single/multiple cloud provider platforms have diverse characteristics requiring extensive monitoring and benchmarking mechanisms to ensure run-time Quality of Service (QoS) (e.g., latency and throughput). This paper proposes, develops and validates CLAMBS - Cross-Layer Multi-Cloud Application Monitoring and Benchmarking as-a-Service for efficient QoS monitoring and benchmarking of cloud applications hosted on multi-clouds environments. The major highlight of CLAMBS is its capability of monitoring and benchmarking individual application components such as databases and web servers, distributed across cloud layers (âˆ—-aaS), spread among multiple cloud providers. We validate CLAMBS using prototype implementation and extensive experimentation and show that CLAMBS efficiently monitors and benchmarks application components on multi-cloud platforms including Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure."

"Engineering Fluorescent Gold Nanoclusters Using Xanthate-Functionalized Hydrophilic Polymers: Toward Enhanced Monodispersity and Stability Fluorescence; Metal Clusters; Icosahedron We introduce xanthate-functionalized poly(cyclic imino ethers)s (PCIEs), specifically poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) and poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazine) given their stealth characteristics, as an attractive alternative to conventional thiol-based ligands for the synthesis of highly monodisperse and fluorescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs). The xanthate in the PCIEs interacts with Au ions, acting as a well-controlled template for the direct formation of PCIE-AuNCs. This method yields red-emitting AuNCs with a narrow emission peak (Î»em = 645 nm), good quantum yield (4.3-4.8%), long fluorescence decay time (a722-844 ns), and unprecedented product yield (>98%). The PCIE-AuNCs exhibit long-term colloidal stability, biocompatibility, and antifouling properties, enabling a prolonged blood circulation, lower nonspecific accumulation in major organs, and better renal clearance when compared with AuNCs without polymer coating. The advances made here in the synthesis of metal nanoclusters using xanthate-functionalized PCIEs could propel the production of highly monodisperse, biocompatible, and renally clearable nanoprobes in large-scale for different theranostic applications."

"System of systems modelling Product-service Systems; Service Economy; Value Co-Creation The design, manufacturing and through-life support of modern engineering systems such as an aircraft or a frigate are complex, multifaceted and may change over time. These engineering systems areworking in an environment that has multiple individual users, complicated supply chain, many government and socially affected stakeholders. In essence, these systems are working as a system of interacting semiautonomous systems each of which are governed by their individual set of rules and could operate with different enterprise structures. Engineers trying to apply the theory of systems engineering to ""design"" a system of systems find the outcome often unpredictable and uncontrollable, as the linked systems operate with high degree of independence. System operations are embedded in business networks that are evolving and changing all the time. Individuals and organisations participate voluntarily in the networks. They can come and go at any time without warning. This highly uncertain relationship requires a different approach. This chapter will address the modelling requirements to design, develop, implement and operate a complex system that interacts with many socio-technical systems. The methodology is illustrated by two case studies."

"An improved progressive failure modelling and damage tolerant design methodology for composite scarf joints with bondline flaws Adhesive Joints; Aluminum; Araldite There is a lack of understanding on the damage tolerant design of bonded scarf joints, specifically when an existing bondline flaw affects the performance. This paper presents an improved progressive damage modelling methodology for assessing the damage tolerant performance of composite scarf joints containing artificial flaws in the bondline. The developed methodology is validated using an experimental study investigating the influences of design parameters on the strength of scarf joints under quasi-static tensile loading. The presented work gives excellent predictions of joint strength, and significant insight into the initiation, interaction and progression of damage. A new damage tolerant design approach is subsequently proposed for the application of bonded composite scarf joints, particularly in primary aerospace structures. The proposed design approach assesses the state of the stress at the failure-critical regions of adhesive and adherend to inform on damage-tolerant safe design loads, thus improving the future application of bonded composite scarf joints."
"Ex vivo human organotypic brain slice cultures as a powerful tool to advance NeuroHIV cure strategies People living with HIV (PLWH) treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) still face neurological challenges. These challenges occur due to the inability of current anti-HIV treatments to eliminate the persistence of virus in the brain, which can lead to HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) that affect up to 69% of PLWH. Lack of relevant models of HIV central nervous system (CNS) infection (NeuroHIV) have precluded the use of effective anti-HIV treatments in the clinic that aims to eliminate persisting CNS virus and result in HIV cure. In this project, we will establish and validate the use of a biologically relevant 3D model of the brain, using human organotypic brain slice cultures (BSCs) derived from healthy brain tissue samples from patients undergoing resective epilepsy surgery or brain tumour resections at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Healthy brain slices will be grown in the laboratory under conditions to promote tissue
survival for up to 4 weeks. BSCs will eventually be infected with laboratory strains of HIV, where curative strategies to eliminate all persisting HIV in BSCs will be evaluated. BSCs represent an ideal model to test new anti-HIV cure strategies to eliminate persisting HIV that drives neurocognitive disorders, thus improving health outcomes for PLWH."

"Precise and compact movement sensors to support the industry 4.0 movement Precise and rapid autonomous movement is crucial for emerging applications ranging from self-driving cars and robotics, to
surgery and other initiatives in the industry 4.0 movement. However, such autonomous movement will require inertial
movement sensors to provide fast and accurate sensing and feedback on the speed and acceleration and enable calculation
of trajectory and position in real time. Inertial movement sensors are used in mass manufactured consumer electronics, such
as mobile phones, but these do not have the accuracy required for future industry 4.0 applications. Higher precision sensors
exist, but they are bulky and expensive and are hence limited mainly to military applications. Realising the vision of industry
4.0 depends on the emergence of sensors that have military precision, but at the cost, size and scale of consumer electronics."

"Improving support for LGBTIQ suicidal behaviour: insight from lived experience LGBTIQ people experience elevated rates of psychological distress and an increased lifetime risk for suicidal behaviour. ‘Minority stress’ is a major explanation for this but does not sufficiently address the fact that LGBTIQ people often belong to other ‘minority’ communities or culturally diverse groups. In Australia, where little is known about suicidal behaviour and preventative strategies for LGBTIQ communities, this project is a vital step towards address this gap. Through a qualitative study we aim to understand factors that influence and protect against suicidal behaviour in LGBTIQ communities, and support practices and services that are experienced as helpful to prevent or manage it. We will generate new knowledge about lived experiences of LGBTIQ suicidal behaviour (including distress, thoughts and attempts) in culturally diverse LGBTIQ communities in Australia, including Indigenous LGBTIQ groups. The project is an innovative partnership with Switchboard, Victoria, Roses in the Ocean, and a cross-sector LGBTIQ advisory group including Indigenous representation and Beyond Blue. Framed by a co-design methodology, implementation and evaluation plan, we will synthesise findings from a rapid evidence assessment and 25 interviews with LGBTIQ people with lived experience, including Indigenous participants. Findings will be translated into policy briefings, a training workshop for suicide prevention and support in LGBTIQ communities and disseminated through publications and a stakeholder dissemination event. Finally, we will pilot our research partnership and co-design approach prior to a large grant application focused on evaluating suicide prevention services for culturally diverse LGBTIQ communities."
"Designing online communication mix for machinery manufacturers Product-service Systems; Service Economy; Value Co-Creation Recent global challenges and the development of digital technologies have caused companies to update their business models to incorporate the variety of existing online communication tools. This enables companies to design their communication with customers and other stakeholders in the most effective way based on the company's business goals. This study provides an approach for planning and assessing online communication mix for machinery manufacturers. The authors conducted a series of expert interviews and used the analytic hierarchy process as well as the method of parametric identification to determine the optimal set of elements for online communication in the market of machinery manufacturing. Based on the research findings, the authors developed and tested the model for planning online communication activities and assessing their effectiveness. The research results detect hidden relationships between the individual elements of online communication activities and the impact of those elements on each other.

"Codesigning participatory strategies with older adults to reduce perceived risk and promote digital inclusion As the COVID19 pandemic has highlighted, digital engagement is crucial in fostering social inclusion. Social exclusion is a significant threat to the wellbeing of older adults. One of the critical motivations for seniors’ lack of engagement with ICT and the digital economy, is perceived security risks. While online threats exist, seniors’ often base security concerns on perceptions of risk. This project adopts an innovative multidisciplinary approach that focusses on codesigning strategies with older adults to take into account their lived
experiences of ICT—connecting practice with perceptions. By managing perceived risks, seniors are better equipped to engage with the digital economy."

"How cholesterol optimises ion pump function in animal membranes (Administered by University of Sydney) The aims of the Project are to determine how cholesterol optimises ion pump function in animal membranes and to identify the major effects of cholesterol and its derivatives on the physical properties of membranes. High levels of cholesterol (up to 50 mol%) are required in the plasma membrane of all animal cells for survival. Insufficient cholesterol biosynthesis leads to severe birth defects. The requirement for cholesterol is likely linked in part to its acceleration of pump activity. The sodium pump is essential to numerous physiological processes (e.g. cell division, nerve, muscle and kidney activity). A benefit of our study will be knowledge on the molecular origin of diseases associated with inhibition of cholesterol production."

"Chapter 11: Machine Learning and Scoring Functions (SFs) for Molecular Drug Discovery: Prediction and Characterisation of Druggable Drugs and Targets Chemoinformatics; Drug Discovery; Topographic Mapping Predicting druggability and prioritising disease-modifying targets is critical in drug discovery. In this chapter, we describe the testing of a druggability rule based on 9 molecular parameters, which uses cutpoints for each molecular parameter and targets based on mixture clustering discriminant analysis. We demonstrate that principal component constructs and score functions of violations can be used to identify the hidden pattern of druggable molecules and disease targets. Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network rules to classify the high-score target from the low-score molecular violators, based both on molecular parameters and the principal component constructs, have confirmed the value of logD's inclusion in the scoring function. Our scoring functions of counts of violations and novel principal component analytic molecular and target-based constructs partitioned chemospace well, identifying both good and poor druggable molecules and targets. Viable molecules and targets were located in both the beyond Rule of 5 and expanded Rule of 5 regions. Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks showed different variable importance profiles, with Artificial Neural Networks models performing better than Random Forests. The most important molecular descriptors that influence classification, by the Random Forest methods, were MW, NATOM, logD, and PSA. The optimal Artificial Neural Networks target models indicated that PSA and logD were more important than the traditional parameter MW. Overall, our score 4 partitions using logD were optimal at classification as shown in all Random Forests and Artificial Neural Networks analyses."

"A multi-physics framework model towards coupled fire-structure interaction for Flax/PP composite beams Flammability; Epoxide; Fiber-Reinforced Composite In this paper, a coupled fire-structure model combining the finite volume and finite element methods, which captures the essential physics of the problem has been developed. The model is based on a multi-physics framework where the essential physics pertaining to the combustion process of the fire and resultant thermo-mechanical response of the structure, in particular, of natural fibre reinforced composites, has been incorporated. In addition, a relatively new concept of adiabatic surface temperature has been introduced as a practical means to transfer data between fire and thermal/structural models at the gas-solid interface. The model predicts the temperature, stress distribution and deformation behaviour of composite beams under combined thermal and mechanical loads."
"Understanding and measuring the socio-ecological benefits of greening actions Ecological surveys
A first key step will be to inventory the plant species occurring at each site ? before and after the greening actions take place. We then implement the following three types of surveys: (i) direct observation of plant-insect pollinator interactions, (ii) direct observation of plant-bird behavioural interactions, and (iii) sweep-netting of insect species on above-ground vegetation. Surveys will be temporally replicated
at least three times during each year of the study, which will allow us to generate the necessary replication data to account for the imperfect detection of species/interactions.
Qualitative social surveys
We will build on an established interdisciplinary framework that identifies the broad range of health, wellbeing and psycho-social outcomes associated with urban greenspace. We will use a longitudinal mixed-method qualitative design to compare baseline and short-term outcomes the greening actions that will transform Sheils Reserve into a formal parkland broadly accessible by the public and local residents. Using a pre- and post- design we will evaluate the relationships between a range of site and social factors that may influence the outcomes of the greening actions. We will use qualitative interviews with residents pre- and post- greening actions to understand the impacts and use of Sheils Reserve and how the new, more biodiverse greenspace impacts use, connection with place or nature, and health and wellbeing outcomes."
"Mathematical Modelling Comparison of a Reciprocating, a Szorenyi Rotary, and a Wankel Rotary Engine Rotary Engines; Combustion Chambers; Pump This paper provides an explanation of the geometry, design, and operational principles for the three engines; having special emphasis in the Szorenyi rotary engine which has a deforming rhombus revolving inside a mathematically defined stator. A basic ideal mathematical simulation of those engines were performed, assuming the Otto cycle for the three engines. Also, it assumes the volumetric efficiency of 100%, a wide-open throttle (WOT), no knock nor any mechanical or thermal losses. This simulation focuses on how the fuel burns during combustion, creating pressure and thus, net work. A comparison in pressure traces and cycle performance is made. The study concludes analysing and comparing the ignition advance; finding the best advance for each engine thus the net work between the three engines during one working cycle. Finally, this paper analyses how the different volume change ratio for the combustion chamber of the Szorenyi, Wankel and the reciprocating engine have an effect in the pressure, net work and thermal efficiency generated inside the chamber during combustion for every working cycle."

"Personalized medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases Personalized medicine is a model in which medical decisions and treatments are tailored to the individual patient based on the specific characteristics of their disease. With the rapidly falling cost of whole genome sequencing and the development of portable benchtop genome sequences such as the MinION, there is potential to implement this technology to enable a patient to receive personalized medicine in relation to treatment of infectious disease. The current barriers preventing the use of this technology in this approach are knowledge on 1) whether this type of sequencing can be performed directly on patient samples and 2) the genetic determinants of antifungal drug resistance which can be used as biomarkers to indicate drug resistance. This  funding will be used to assess the ability of MinION nanopore technology to rapidly diagnose pathogenic species from clinical samples and identify antifungal drug resistance biomarkers. The activity will commence as soon as funding is received. The clinical samples and isolates are located at the Alfred Hospital so some of the research will be performed there (by PhD student Samah Albehaijani) but the majority (genome sequencing and analysis) will be performed at RMIT.

"Explicating professional boxers' narrative dynamics towards competitive aggressiveness and potential market entry Entrepreneurial Intention; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship Research on subversive entrepreneurship considers the process in which firms outperform rivals when entering the market. Although the research has recognised that firms try to destroy the existing market while creating a new one, it still does not specify the narrative dynamics of subversive market entry. In this study, the market entry was studied in a non-business context (i.e., professional boxing), which widens the view of who could be entrepreneurial individuals. The subversive attributes were measured (applied both in boxing and business) in pre-event narratives that were then related to the competitive aggressiveness in post-event interview narratives. The results show a U-shaped relationship between the optimism and competitive aggressiveness content in these narratives and a negative linear relationship between these same variables. The result of an event moderates this effect into a positive one. These results contribute to the sport management literature by offering a perspective of sportsmen as entrepreneurial narrative generators and potential future entrepreneurs."

"Older Australians & Technology: Making the Connection (OatMc) The OatMc project aims to explore how older Australians use technology to communicate with their social networks. We seek to better understand technology usage patterns supporting connectedness and enhancing social participation. Previous research on this area have provided mixed outcomes. In some cases, technology is seen as a fundamental tool in engaging seniors in key social activities. In other cases, technology is portrayed as a source of anxiety and fear. This project expects to generate novel insights for future research in the area of consumer socialisation by investigating experiences of isolation and connectedness, relationship with different forms of technology, and the consequence of interactions with technology within collaborative networks of people. Expected outcomes of this project will assist in reducing social isolation, thus improving health and well-being. These outcomes include proposed strategies for constructive engagement of technological solutions to combat isolation in older Australians"

"2D SnO/In 2 O 3 van der Waals Heterostructure Photodetector Based on Printed Oxide Skin of Liquid Metals Molybdenum Disulfide; Monolayer; Van Der Waals Heterostructures assembled from atomically thin materials have led to a new paradigm in the development of the next-generation high-performing functional devices. However, the construction of the ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is challenging and/or limited to materials with layered crystal structures. Herein, liquid metal vdW transfer method is used to construct large area heterostructures of atomically thin metal oxides of p-SnO/n-In 2 O 3 with ease. The heterostructure exhibits both outstanding photodetectivity of 5 Ã— 10 9 Jones and photoresponsivity of 1047 A W âˆ’1 with fast response time of â‰¤1 ms under illumination of the 280 nm light. Such excellent performances are due to the formation of the narrow bandgap of the staggered gap at the pâ€“n junction produced by the high-quality SnO/In 2 O 3 heterostructure. The facile production of high-quality vdW heterostructures using the liquid metalâ€“based method therefore provides a promising pathway for realizing future optoelectronic devices."

"Viral Determinants of HIV-1 Transcriptional Latency in the Central Nervous System: Impact on Cure Strategies HIV-1 cannot be eradicated by antiretroviral therapies alone. The major obstacle to eradicating HIV-1 is the ability of proviral DNA to persist latently in cellular reservoirs. Delineation of the mechanisms of persistence in cellular reservoirs and how latency can be reversed to render the cells susceptible to cART is a high priority area for HIV-1 research. Currently a number of latency reversing agents (LRAs) are being trialled for their ability to activate HIV-1 viral transcription from latent integrated proviral genomes to expose infected cells for elimination. The affect of these agents on latent viral genomes in CNS reservoirs has not been investigated. We have previously demonstrated that unique transcriptional regulatory mechanisms exist within the CNS of HIV-1 infected patients and that these mechanisms involve transcriptional regulators involved in chromatin formation and latency. This project aims to identify and define the viral determinants of transcriptional latency of HIV-1 persisting in cellular reservoirs in cART controlling patients in vivo and investigate the affect of LRAs on transcriptional activity of LTRs isolated from cellular reservoirs of the CNS and peripheral compartments of the same patient. This project will utilise a unique and valuable resource of human tissues to determine how HIV-1 remains latent in cellular reservoirs of the CNS in vivo and will shed new light on mechanisms underlying HIV-1 latency in the peripheral T-cell compartment. Eradicating latent HIV-1 infection in the brain reservoir, or devising ways to lock HIV-1 residing in latently-infected CNS cells into a permanently silent state, is pivotal for strategies that presently aim to achieve either a ?sterilising cure? of HIV-1 infection or a ?functional cure?, respectively. Both potential outcomes are dependent on understanding the mechanisms of HIV-1 transcription in all latently infected reservoirs."

"The equivalent translational compliance of steel studs with different steel gauge thicknesses Acoustic Wave Transmission; Biot Theory; Cylindrical Shells The effect of the resilience of the steel studs on the sound insulation of steel stud cavity walls can be modelled as an equivalent translational compliance in simple models for predicting the sound insulation of walls. Previous determinations of this equivalent translational compliance have only been made for 25 gauge steel studs with the height of rooms in a typical house. This paper extends the determination of the equivalent translational compliance to steel studs with steel gauges of 16, 18, 20 and 25 and heights of 2.44 and 4.57 m in walls with stud spacing of both 0.406 and 0.61 m. The equivalent compliance is determined for both line connection and point connection models. The sound insulation of walls predicted using these values of compliance is compared with experiment. Unfortunately, big differences and variations occur between prediction and experiment at 125 and 160 Hz. These big differences occur because of the deep dip in the experimental measurements that occurs with thicker steel studs and wooden studs which was observed experimentally by Bradley and Birta in the laboratory and theoretically by Lin and Garrelick. This dip is not predicted by the simple sound insulation theory of Davy used in this paper."

"Early Menopause: Implementation Research using the Experiences and Perspectives of Women and Health Professionals to Translate Evidence into Practice (Administered by Monash University; NHMRC) Early menopause (menopause before age 45 years), occurs spontaneously or secondary to medical treatments, especially after cancer diagnosis, and affects more than 10% of women1, 2. Early menopause (EM) is associated with significant morbidity, increased mortality and negative impact on quality of life1. EM stakeholders involved in this partnership recognise both consumer and health professional knowledge gaps regarding EM and the need for evidence based resources around EM. These knowledge gaps contribute to delayed diagnosis, variation in management, dissatisfaction with care, non-compliance with cancer treatment, poor risk perception and poorer outcomes."

"Tunable Optical Properties of 2D Materials and Their Applications Molybdenum Disulfide; Monolayer; Van Der Waals Recent efforts have been heavily devoted to the development of next-generation optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials, due to their unique optical properties that are distinctly different from those of bulk counterparts. Given that the feature of flexible tunability is highly desired, various approaches have been demonstrated to efficiently modulate the optical properties, eventually enabling peculiar functionalities or realizing high-performance nanoscale devices. Here, this review focuses on recent advances in tuning the optical properties of 2D materials by external stimuli including electric field, mechanical strain, magnetic field, acoustic wave, and thermal heating. Also, such tunability leads to many emerging applications in the fields of electronics, optics, sensors, and energy harvesting, which are summarized and critically discussed in the paper."

"Sequential droplet reactions for surface-bound gold nanocrater array Nanobubbles; Bubble; Henry Law Femtoliter droplet array exhibit unique stability in contact with a flow. This work demonstrates that reactive femtoliter droplets enables sequential chemical reactions that may be leveraged to simplify the process for producing surface-bound materials. Gold nanocraters (GNCs) are formed on a planar substrate from biphasic reactions between water-insoluble thiol droplets and two aqueous solutions in sequence. The detailed process is that gold precursor solution was injected into a flow chamber hosting a substrate with thiol droplet array in a chamber, followed by injection of a reductant solution. The thiol droplets absorb and weakly bond with gold ions in a precursor solution. Subsequent exposure to a reductant solution accelerates the formation of gold clusters in droplets. The final nanoparticles form GNCs over a large surface area, due to fast formation around the droplet rim. The shape of an individual domain was controlled by the duration of ion absorption in the first step of the sequential reaction. Reacting droplets were followed in time by total internal reflection microscope to understand the reaction process. Morphology and composition of GNCs were characterized by atomic force microscope, SEM, microspectrophotometer, and X-Ray photoelectron spectrometer. We demonstrate that the as-prepared GNCs exhibits stable catalytic activity in degradation of azo dyes for multiple cycles. Compared to many current approaches for producing surface-bound nanomaterials, our approach is based on sequential droplet reactions in a flow-in process. This approach offers unique flexibility in varying independently the reactant concentration and reaction time of each step in the sequential reaction. The synthesized surface-bound catalytic nanomaterials may be applied in water treatment, optical display or fluorescence imaging."

"Multiple Primary Tumours – Genetic Susceptibility, Metastasis and Survival (administered by WEHI) As the annual number of new cancer cases is projected to rise from 18 million in 2018 to 29 million in 2040, it is urgent that we contain the risk of cancer. Developing a second primary tumour is a major clinical problem with second cancers making up 14% of all incident
malignancies in the US [2]. As survival rates for cancer improve, more people will develop second primary tumours. Currently 12% of breast cancer cases develop a second primary tumour. Cancer survivors have a 14% higher risk of developing a new malignancy than
expected in the general population. However, strikingly and somewhat unexpectedly, those who develop three or more multiple primary cancers have less aggressive malignancies, presenting at earlier stages, some with strong family histories. This suggests a genetic
susceptibility but also an ability to control the cancers they do develop. Indeed, their immune system may be more crucial than their cancer type or even their cancer predisposition syndrome. We propose to study the immune system of patients who develop three or more primary tumours, representing more than 20 tumour types in our cohort and who we suggest:
• are a cohort of individuals who are able to control cancer metastasis across cancer types
• because their immune system may be responding to control their cancers, despite these cancer types being of lethal type. It is noted that when they develop three or more tumours, each of these tumours is diagnosed at an early stage and cured, prior to the development of advanced disease, strikingly, allowing them to live to the same age as population controls."

"Quantum Computing with Rotation-Symmetric Bosonic Codes Entanglement; MDS Code; Qubits Bosonic rotation codes, introduced here, are a broad class of bosonic error-correcting codes based on phase-space rotation symmetry. We present a universal quantum computing scheme applicable to a subset of this class - number-phase codes - which includes the well-known cat and binomial codes, among many others. The entangling gate in our scheme is code agnostic and can be used to interface different rotation-symmetric encodings. In addition to a universal set of operations, we propose a teleportation-based error-correction scheme that allows recoveries to be tracked entirely in software. Focusing on cat and binomial codes as examples, we compute average gate fidelities for error correction under simultaneous loss and dephasing noise and show numerically that the error-correction scheme is close to optimal for error-free ancillae and ideal measurements. Finally, we present a scheme for fault-tolerant, universal quantum computing based on the concatenation of number-phase codes and Bacon-Shor subsystem codes."
"Enhancing radiotherapy with a novel 53BP1 inhibitor The donor expects that the funds provided will be applied exclusively to the project. In the event the project is discontinued, the donor agrees to the funds be reallocated within the School of Science, Medical sciences programs for research purposes.

Project Aims:
A hallmark of cancer is impaired DNA repair rendering cancer cells mutagenic and vulnerable to DNA
damage, which is exploited in radiotherapy. The principle DNA repair mechanism in cancer is nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which is regulated by the epigenetic protein 53BP11,2. Silencing of 53BP1 increases cancer cell radiation sensitivity, increasing DNA damage cell death3. Recently, Dr Headey developed a small molecule inhibitor of 53BP1 (EoHR). The aim of this proposal is to
demonstrate enhanced tumour cell death when EoHR is used in conjunction with radiation in a variety of
cancer cells as proof of concept for future translational studies."

"Uptake and distribution of nanoparticles by cancer cells There is growing interest in nanoparticle (NP) toxicity due to the promise of nanoparticles
(NPs) for diverse applications in drug delivery, biosensing, biological imaging, gene therapy and
photothermal therapy. While researchers continue to investigate novel medical applications, we still
have a limited understanding of critical nano-bio interactions. In our previous work, human prostate
cancer cells were used to study the uptake and toxicity of gold NPs of different size and shape. In
this study, we plan to take advantage of recent advances in soft X-ray tomography to collect
comprehensive three-dimensional data in order to characterise the interaction of 3 types of NPs with
human prostate cancer cells (PC3). While the experimental feasibility has been shown in recent
papers, we plan to test the limits of the technique by studying 3 types of NPs (gold, silver and
nanodiamond) with size ranges from ~10-200 nm. This will form the basis for an ongoing
experimental program in better understanding NP toxicity.

"Smart phase behavior modeling of asphaltene precipitation using advanced computational frameworks: ENN, GMDH, and MPMR Asphaltenes; Petroleum; Oil Asphaltene precipitation is the reason behind some of the most destructive issues in the oil industry such as wettability alteration, formation plugging, and reduction of the relative permeability. There are different experimental and modeling methods to study the asphaltene phase behavior. However, those approaches are either time-consuming or costly. In addition, the prediction of asphaltene precipitation is challenging due to the nonlinear dependence. Therefore, in this study, three advanced computational algorithms including group method of data handling (GMDH), emotional neural network (ENN), and minimax probability machine regression (MPMR) are developed and applied to the comprehensive dataset to estimate the amount of asphaltene precipitation as the function of temperature, dilution ratio, and the molecular weight of the n-alkanes. Many different performance metrics are used to evaluate the predictive performance of intelligent algorithms. Obtained results of the modeling reveal that intelligent computational algorithms have a great ability to mimic the nonlinear relationships between the target variable and its influential variables. The results indicate MPMR as the best predictive model with the highest R-squared value on both training and testing datasets with values of R 2 = 0.992 and R 2 = 0.991, respectively. In addition, MPMR is compared and outperformed empirical correlations."

"Achieving arithmetic learning in honeybees and examining how individuals learn Numerosity; Number Line; Approximate In recent years honeybees have demonstrated intriguing numerical capacities, leading to the recent discovery of their ability to perform simple arithmetic by learning to add or subtract â€˜oneâ€™ using symbolic representations of operators. When training an insect with a miniature brain containing less than one million neurons to understand a conceptual rule, the procedure is of vital importance. We explain in detail the controls and process of designing an experiment to test for complex behaviors in a relatively simple brained animal.

"Feasibility Study of Scale-up Options for the Production of Nanocrystalline Cellulose from Australian Rice Hulls RMIT and SunRice have been in recent discussions regarding the opportunity to value-add to rice hulls. One potential high value product identified has been nano-crystalline cellulose (NCC). Nanocrystalline cellulose is a fully biodegradable and biocompatible nano-material; as such it has attracted great attention in biomedical related applications. It has also found increasing applications in the areas of personal care, chemicals, foods, paper, medical science, pharmaceuticals, engineering materials, oil drilling, and biodegradable packaging film as well. Therefore, it is expected that the demand of NCC will continue to increase significantly in the near future.
RMIT has recently completed some preliminary studies on the production of NCC from rice hulls and, now in collaboration with SunRice, wishes to further develop an experimental program to collect and collate information to develop a business case for a pilot plant."

"Influence of isotopically labeled internal standards on quantification of serum/plasma 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry Liquid Chromatography; Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Sample Preparation Objectives: Our recent survey of 44 mass spectrometry laboratories across 17 countries identified variation in internal standard (IS) choice for the measurement of serum/plasma 17Î±-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The choice of IS may contribute to inter-method variations. This study evaluated the effect of two common isotopically labeled IS on the quantification of 17OHP by LC-MS/MS. Methods: Three collaborating LC-MS/MS laboratories from Asia, Europe and Australia, who routinely measure serum 17OHP, compared two IS, (1) IsoSciences carbon-13 labeled 17OHP-[2,3,4-13C3], and (2) IsoSciences deuterated 17OHP-[2,2,4,6,6,21,21,21-2H]. This was performed as part of their routine patient runs using their respective laboratory standard operating procedure. Results: The three laboratories measured 99, 89, 95 independent samples, respectively (upto 100nmol/L) using the 13Cand 2H-labeled IS. The slopes of the Passing-Bablok regression ranged 0.98-1.00 (all 95% confidence interval [CI] estimates included the line of identity), and intercept of <0.1 nmol/L. Average percentage differences of a'0.04% to a'5.4% were observed between the two IS materials, which were less than the optimal bias specification of 7% determined by biological variation, indicating no clinically significant difference. The results of 12RoyalCollege of Pathologists ofAustralasiaQuality Assurance Programs (RCPAQAP) proficiency samples (1-40 nmol/L) measured by the laboratories were all within the RCPAQAP analytical performance specifications for both IS. Conclusions: Overall, the comparison between the results of 13C- A nd 2H-labeled IS for 17OHP showed good agreement, and show no clinically significant bias when incorporated into the LC-MS/MS methods employed in the collaborating laboratories."

"Bipartite Tracking Consensus of Linear Multi-Agent Systems with a Dynamic Leader Consensus Problem; Formation Control; Topology In this brief, the distributed bipartite tracking consensus problem for linear multi-agent systems (MASs) in the presence of a single leader is investigated. Compared with some related works on this topic, the leader's control inputs in the present MAS model are allowed to be nonzero and unknown to each follower. To guarantee bipartite tracking consensus, a new kind of distributed non-smooth protocols based on the relative state information of neighboring agents are proposed and analyzed. With the help of tools from Lyapunov stability theory and graph theory, it is shown that bipartite tracking consensus in the close-loop MAS can be achieved if the gain matrix of protocol is suitably constructed and the control parameters of protocol are, respectively, larger than some positive quantities depending on global information of the considered MAS. To provide some efficient criteria for consensus seeking without involving any global information, some fully distributed protocols with adaptive control parameters are further designed and discussed. Finally, numerical simulations are given for illustration."
"Reducing modern slavery with new information and enforcement technologies Forced and bonded labour, as well as poverty wages, have been uncovered in Australian meat and fashion manufacturing supply chains. Eight government inquiries since 2016 identified new business models entailing complex supply chains as a barrier to effective enforcement of labour standards. The application of information systems like blockchain has not yet been explored to aid enforcement efforts. This innovative research adopts a novel interdisciplinary approach, combining labour law, regulatory studies, information systems to evaluate information technologies and design tools that are feasible and readily useable. This promises to increase the capacity of regulators to detect and prevent modern slavery."

Moments of noticing: 'I See You' as a speculative work towards an essayistic list practice for interactive documentary Documentary; Non-Fiction; Interactivity This chapter uses an interactive film as a case study to argue for list making as an alternative to stories for making interactive documentaries. It argues that lists are suited to network-specific media forms because lists are made up of discrete parts that can be easily arranged in multiple ways. This raises the problem of how makers and audiences might understand lists and the chapter details how this has been explored in the case study.

"JLABS World Without Disease Quickfire Challenge (QFC) RMIT University has developed an advanced handheld personalised nebuliser for inhaled delivery of next generation lung cancer drugs (namely, biologics such as RNAi, DNA, peptides or proteins), making treatment of lung cancer easier, cheaper, safer, more accessible and more effective by directly targeting the site of the tumour. In particular, the novel technology we have developed circumvents limitations associated with competing inhalers or nebulisers on the market for effective lung cancer therapeutics, which primarily are either prohibitively large to permit portable handheld use at the point of need; a one-size-fits-all approach that does not allow dose customisation to a patient?s particular requirements; possess aerosolisation mechanisms that denature the therapeutic molecule; or do not produce sufficient dose necessary for whole lung exposure over inhalation times that are commensurate for practical administration. Support from the Johnson & Johnson Quickfire Challenge will allow us to develop and commercialise this innovation into affordable life-saving technology, which is expected to revolutionise lung cancer therapy given that there is no product for inhaled lung cancer therapeutics currently on the market.

"Travel Itinerary Recommendations with Must-see Points-of-Interest Human Mobility; Taxis; Points Of Interest Travelling and touring are popular leisure activities enjoyed by millions of tourists around the world. However, the task of travel itinerary recommendation and planning is tedious and challenging for tourists, who are often unfamiliar with the various Points-of-Interest (POIs) in a city. Apart from identifying popular POIs, the tourist needs to construct a travel itinerary comprising a subset of these POIs, and to order these POIs as a sequence of visits that can be completed within his/her available touring time. For a more realistic itinerary, the tourist also has to account for travelling time between POIs and visiting times at individual POIs. Furthermore, this itinerary should incorporate tourist preferences such as desired starting and ending POIs (e.g., POIs that are near the tourist's hotel) and a subset of must-see POIs (e.g., popular POIs that a tourist must visit). We term this the TourMustSee problem, which is based on a variant of the Orienteering problem. Following which, we propose the LP+M algorithm for solving the TourMustSee problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). Using a Flickr dataset of POI visits in seven touristic cities, we compare LP+M against various ILP-based baselines, and the results show that LP+M recommends better travel itineraries in terms of POI popularity, total POIs visited, total touring time utilized and must-visit POI(s) inclusion."

"Upcycling Domestic Food Waste 2.0: Aeration, Water Content and Temperature in Home Compost Systems Maze and RMIT University intend to continue their research collaboration on home composting systems. Discussions on 20/1/2021 explored next steps to consolidate results of the first project comparing the performance of 9 bin designs by focusing on the curing phase,
ideas to further investigate the effects of aeration on the performance of two key bin designs and future research interests around additives. A long term goal of the research partnership was identified; To develop a list of ten different home composting solutions, or recipes, underpinned by rigorous science. Composting is a complex system, with interacting biophysical and socio-economic components. This research partnership brings together Maze’s expertise in the socio-economic space and RMIT’s expertise in the bio-physical space. The first project developed the collaborative partnership and the experimental methodology for research on home composting systems. The two experiments outlined in the following pages consolidate this first project (Experiment 1) and investigate aeration, via water addition and mixing, and temperature. These experiments are within the scope of a 1 year, $100K Innovation Connections grant project. Maze and RMIT are interested to explore the performance of additions to home composting systems such as different carbon sources (paper, wood pellets, sawdust, other agricultural or forestry wastes), biological additives (worms, bokashi EM formulations). The interactions between these additives and aeration could be explored in a series of experiments funded via an Australian Research Council Linkage grant."
"Improving neurodevelopmental outcomes following fetal growth restriction Growth-restricted babies are often born with damaged brains, including injury to the white matter, and they often develop learning and behavioural problems, and even cerebral palsy.

"Microglia depletion fails to abrogate inflammation-induced sickness in mice and rats Alzheimer Disease; Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Synapses Background: Production of inflammatory mediators by reactive microglial cells in the brain is generally considered the primary mechanism underlying the development of symptoms of sickness in response to systemic inflammation. Methods: Depletion of microglia was achieved in C57BL/6 mice by chronic oral administration of PLX5622, a specific antagonist of colony stimulating factor-1 receptor, and in rats by a knock-in model in which the diphtheria toxin receptor was expressed under the control of the endogenous fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) promoter sequence. After successful microglia depletion, mice and rats were injected with a sickness-inducing dose of lipopolysaccharide according to a 2 (depletion vs. control) Ã— 2 (LPS vs. saline) factorial design. Sickness was measured by body weight loss and decreased locomotor activity in rats and mice, and reduced voluntary wheel running in mice. Results: Chronic administration of PLX5622 in mice and administration of diphtheria toxin to knock-in rats depleted microglia and peripheral tissue macrophages. However, it did not abrogate the inducible expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain in response to LPS and even exacerbated it for some of the cytokines. In accordance with these neuroimmune effects, LPS-induced sickness was not abrogated, rather it was exacerbated when measured by running wheel activity in mice. Conclusions: These findings reveal that the sickness-inducing effects of acute inflammation can develop independently of microglia activation."

"FFT-based Inverse Homogenization for Cellular Material Design Topology Optimization; Numerical Methods; Compliant Mechanisms Besides constituting components, the properties of composites are highly relevant to their microstructures. The work proposed a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based inverse homogenization method implemented by the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique to explore the vast potential of cellular materials. The periodic boundary condition of self-repeated representative volume elements can be naturally satisfied in the FFT-based homogenization scheme. The objective function of the optimization problem is the specific moduli or the quadratic difference between the effective value and the target, which are obtained in terms of mutual strain energies. Its sensitivity to the design variable, namely the elemental density, is derived from the adjoint variable method and used as the criterion to remove or add material in local elements. Numerical examples show that the proposed method generates a series of architected cellular materials with maximum modulus, negative Poisson's ratio, and specific elasticity tensor. FFT-based homogenization in the method demands less memory usage but has high efficiency. Thus, it can achieve topology optimization of unit cell with one million hexahedral elements. This approach contributes to the extended application of FFT-based homogenization and can guide the microstructure design of mechanical metamaterials."
"Evaluation proposal: Traineeships in the Victorian Community Sector  The Traineeship Initiative model as it stands in the proposal will need over the course of the initiative to be developed, trialled and remodelled as suggested through evidence. Built on an action research platform the aim of the research will therefore be to explore over consecutive cohorts how best to optimise access to and engagement in education that builds industry readiness and achieves a  successful career pathway for young people at risk of long-termdisadvantage. Given the Program plan for cohorts over time, the collection of data and feedback will be cyclical allowing adaptations to the model over the program period.
Point 1
The research will involve two distinct dimensions. The first is data collection across and between program partners and from trainees at specific points in time to explore experiences, impacts and outcomes alongside successes and challenges. The second will be engaging an action research group to co-design solutions that can be implemented and trialled in subsequent cohorts. This proposal sets out how each of these two complementary aims will be organised and delivered in Section 4 below. However the approach above will be dictated by the detailed understanding of how the project operates to produce the intended outcomes. This is considered below in the development of a program logic."

"Comparison of current control strategies based on FCS-MPC and D-PI-PWM control for actively damped VSCs with LCL-filters Inverters; Electric Current Control; Connected This paper presents a comparative study of the proportional-integral-based (PI-based) synchronous current control strategy with derivative-feedback-based active damping and the finite-control-set model-predictive-control-based (FCS-MPC-based) synchronous current control strategy with cost-function-based active damping. For a fair comparison, the sensor requirement and the average switching frequency of FCS-MPC are made equivalent to that of the pulse-width-modulation-based counterpart through internal model estimation and control sampling frequency adjustment. The comparative study considers gain/weighting-factor tuning, delay compensation, switching harmonics, and active damping performance at the critical frequency operating point. The overall performance of both schemes is validated through the same experimental setup and test scenarios. The results conclude that the emerging FCS-MPC has the potential to produce similar results as the classical PI-based counterpart while carrying some practical features. These include being intuitive in active damping design and tuning, guaranteeing fast dynamics, and being sufficiently robust to grid impedance shifting. These findings essentially justify the potential of model predictive control being a viable alternative for this area of application."
"iMOVE Top-up scholarship - Integrating MaaS into public transport journeys for users with a focus on vulnerable travellers The transport industry is experiencing a period of transformation with new technologies, products, and services to
provide citizens in urban and rural areas with better mobility. Mobility as a Service (MaaS) offers travellers a onestop platform to seamlessly plan and pay for various mobility services which are convenient, sustainable, and
cheaper.

So far, most services have targeted urban residents with no or limited attention to societal goals such as equitable
access and fairness. This PhD Project will focus on smart adoption of MaaS with the purpose of providing vulnerable
travellers (e.g., elderly and people with disabilities) with equitable mobility services.

This project will employ Machine Learning techniques to better understand user activity patterns, travel behaviour,
and mode preferences. Smart card data, automatic vehicle location data, travel mode choice data, and Census data
(to identify population density based on disability and age) will be used as input to machine learning models.

Based on the insights from the model, and considering public transport as the transit backbone, the aim is to achieve
an informed strategy to effectively integrate other available means of transport and new modes (e.g., electric

"Network Remote Powering through Quasi-Passive Optical Nodes The Internet has been deployed world widely using optical networks and it has significantly changed our daily lives in the past decade. However, providing network connections to remote areas remains challenging. One of the major limitations for remote access is the powering of remote optical network nodes, where the local power supply for network infrastructure may not be available. This project aims to solve this key limitation to provide reliable and broadband network access to remote areas through innovative low power consumption optical network nodes and the remote powering of these network nodes. The novel network node to be realised in this project is quasi-passive, and it does not consume any power under static network connections. When network reconfiguration is needed according to changing traffic and network conditions, the power required for the node reconfiguration will be remotely delivered using the same traffic transmission optical fibre. The principle and feasibility of such quasi-passive nodes and remote powering have been verified in our recent preliminary study, and this project will focus on the further investigation, optimisation and proof-of-concept experimental demonstrations of such node and the remote powering technology. The outcomes of this project will eliminate local power supply requirements in remote network nodes, to significantly facilitate reliable and high-speed Internet access in remote areas and remote communities."

"Mechanical Properties of Bambusa Oldhamii and Yushania-Alpina Bamboo Fibres Reinforced Polypropylene Composites Mechanical Properties; Sisal; Coir The current studies aim to measure the mechanical strength based on age, harvesting season and bamboo species in Ethiopia. The bamboo fibres are extracted using a roll milling machine, which was developed by the author. The age groups (1, 2 and 3 years), harvesting months (February and November), and bamboo species (Yushania alpina and Bambusa oldhamii) are the parameters of the current research studies. Prepregs and composites were produced from bamboo fibres and polypropylene. The mechanical properties of bamboo fibres and their composites in Ethiopia have not been investigated by researchers for the composite application so far. The tensile strength, Youngâ€™s modulus, and impact strength of injibara (Y. alpina) bamboo fibres reinforced PP composites from the ages of 1â€“ 3 years old in November is 111 Â± 9â€“125 Â± 8 MPa, 15 Â± 0.9â€“25 Â± 0.72 GPa, and 47 Â± 5 KJ/m2â€“57 Â± 6 KJ/m2, whereas, in February, it is 86 Â± 3.86â€“116 Â± 10 MPa, 11 Â± 0.71â€“23 Â± 1.5 GPa, and 34 Â± 4â€“52 Â± 6 KJ/m2, respec-tively. Moreover, Kombolcha (B. oldhamii), bamboo fibres reinforced PP composites in November are 93 Â± 7â€“111 Â± 8 MPa, 7 Â± 0.51â€“17 Â± 2.56 GPa, and 39 Â± 4â€“44 Â± 5 KJ/m2, whereas, in February, it is 60 Â± 5â€“104 Â± 10 MPa, 12 Â± 0.95â€“14 Â± 0.92 GPa, and 26 Â± 3 KJ/m2 â€“38 Â± 4 KJ/m2, respectively. Furthermore, Mekaneselam (Y. alpina) bamboo fibres reinforced PP composites in November are 99 Â± 8â€“120 Â± 11 MPa, 9 Â± 0.82â€“16 Â± 1.85 GPa, and 37 Â± 4 KJ/m2 â€“46 Â± 5 KJ/m2, whereas, in Febru-ary, it is 91 Â± 8â€“110 Â± 9 MPa, 8 Â± 0.75â€“14 Â± 1.86 GPa, and 34 Â± 3 KJ/m2 â€“40 Â± 4 KJ/m2, respectively. At two years, November and Injibara bamboo have recorded the highest mechanical properties in the current research studies. Bamboo fiber strength in Ethiopia is comparable to the previous study of bamboo fibres and glass fibres used for composite materials in the automotive industry."

"Numerical investigation on the bubble size distribution around NACA0015 hydrofoil Bubble; Void Fraction; Two Phase Flow Two-phase bubbly flows occur widely in nature and are extensively applied in industry. The aeration processes underwater is one type of two-phase bubbly flow that directly impacts on the downstream water quality by reducing the oxygen content in the water. The most important influencing factors for optimization design of Auto-venting turbines (AVTs), for solving the low level of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the discharged downstream water, are the quantity of entrained air, the bubble size distribution resulting from coalescence and breakage processes, and the rate of oxygen transfer from the bubbles. In order to better understand the influencing flow conditions on the bubble size distribution, in this paper a numerical investigation for flow around NACA0015 hydrofoil is carried out. The numerical simulations require the consideration of the dynamic behaviors of two-phase flow and bubbles undergoing coalescence and breakup. For this purpose, the ensemble-averaged mass and momentum transport equations for continuous and dispersed phases are modeled within the two-fluid modeling framework. These equations are coupled with population balance equations (PBE) to aptly account for the coalescence and break-up of the bubbles. The resultant bubble size, normalised velocity and void fraction distributions for different flow conditions including angle of attack (AOA), air-entrainment coefficient, and Reynolds number are presented and discussed. The results show that varying AOA has the most significant impact on the distribution of the bubbles in the wake."

"The nuclear non-proliferation regime: An historical perspective Non-Proliferation; Nuclear Weapons; Disarmament As the twenty-first century appears to be entering a more intensified globalised nuclear age, nations and academics alike consistently criticise the frameworks and foundational agencies created to ensure non-proliferation, security, and multi-lateral negotiations. Notwithstanding the significant reductions in nuclear arsenals made over the last several decades, thanks to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the numerous nuclear agencies and watchdogs, it is evident that the risks emanating from nuclear weapons and their associated materials have continually expanded. By ensuring that the global community has protections and safeguards in place to promote international dialogue and nuclear non-proliferationâ€”including the Cooperative Nuclear Threat Reduction Program, International Atomic Energy Agency, Global Threat Reduction Initiative, as well as nuclear free zones and review processesâ€”the nuclear non-proliferation regime can arguably ensure that the devastating threat to humankind is reduced. However, as countries scramble to once again refine and modernise their nuclear stockpiles, the necessity to review, reshape, and re-think these foundational safeguards is more vital than ever."

"Centralized multiple-view sensor fusion using labeled multi-Bernoulli filters Random Sets; Multi-Target Tracking; Clutter This paper presents a novel method for track-to-track fusion to integrate multiple-view sensor data in a centralized sensor network. The proposed method overcomes the drawbacks of the commonly used Generalized Covariance Intersection method, which considers constant weights allocated for sensors. We introduce an intuitive approach to automatically tune the weights in the Generalized Covariance Intersection method based on the amount of information carried by the posteriors that are locally computed from measurements acquired at each sensor node. To quantify information content, Cauchyâ€“Schwarz divergence is used. Our solution is particularly formulated for sensor networks where the update step of a Labeled Multi-Bernoulli filter is running locally at each node. We will show that with that type of filter, the weight associated with each sensor node can be separately adapted for each Bernoulli component of the filter. The results of numerical experiments show that our proposed method can successfully integrate information provided by multiple sensors with different fields of view. In such scenarios, our method significantly outperforms the common approach of using Generalized Covariance Intersection method with constant weights, in terms of inclusion of all existing objects and tracking accuracy."

"Hyperspectral Imaging for Ischaemia Detection Delayed detection of poor perfusion to the feet of people with diabetes can result in chronic wounds, and the annual cost $AU612 Million and is the leading cause of amputation. Kumar has developed a non-invasive imaging technology which is based on hyperspectral imaging and this can identify regions of poor blood supply. Indus Instruments Inc is a research oriented company that focuses on technology to monitor blood-flow and manufacture Doppler devices. This project will validate the use of hyperspectral imaging (HySI) technology developed by Kumar for identifying ischemic regions and regions with poor perfusion by laboratory based comparison of HySI and Doppler measurements. This will lead to a non-intrusive, easy to use, point-of-care device for detecting regions of poor perfusion in conditions such as diabetic foot ulcers, which if not diagnosed in time can lead to amputation. It will identify low perfusion areas in at risk of ulceration which can be addressed by offloading, revascularisation or other wound management strategies. Another potential application of this device would be to detect ischemic conditions due to pressure which is a major cause of chronic wounds among the elderly or people in long-term bed-rest. This has applications in wound management, general age-care facilities and Defence."

"Evaluation of hot spots: place-based, cross-sector collaborations responding to the health impacts of heatwave The Project Team has extensive and proven experience in successfully analysing and coproducing a range of engagement materials and approaches for place-based adaptation and resilience (See above). All of which has direct relevance and application for evaluating placebased activities seeking to reduce local vulnerabilities to various implications of climate change such as heatwaves. However, it is a priority to RMIT and LMCF that this evaluation extends existing skills and knowledge of all participants, encourages skill and capability development, and enables all participants to learn throughout the project. We therefore propose a collaborative, co-learning approach to the evaluation whereby the research team (RMIT) will support LMCF and the Hotspots project partners to design and undertake the evaluation themselves. RMIT will also work with them to reflect on what they learned through the process not just about the Hotspots program but also about evaluation and engagihg in a place-based1 cross-sector program such as the Hotspots Initiative."

"The relationship between fire and weeds in Victorian grasslands: A case study of Terrick Terrick National Park (PhD student: Isabelle Hally) Prescribed burns are often recommended for controlling exotic weeds, but in some cases, fire is known to facilitate weed invasion. The aim of this project is to understand when prescribed burns can successfully suppress weed invasion and facilitate native vegetation recovery. We will combine field surveys of native and exotic plant communities pre- and post-fire, measurements of environmental variables including soil microbial community sampling, and experimental removal of invasive weeds, to understand the mechanisms in which fire constrains or facilitates plant invasion. This project will inform future management of exotic weeds in fire-prone environments."

"Experimental Investigations of End Bearing Anchors Under Uplift Load Using Transparent Soil and Numerical Simulation Model Test; Geotechnical Engineering; Piles This paper presents a series of small-scale physical model tests, using transparent soil and particle image velocimetry technique. The soil displacements, anchor load and displacement responses were measured directly from the tests. Based on the results, the anchorâ€™s ultimate uplift load, impact area within the surrounding soil and failure mechanism of the anchor system were studied. Furthermore, numerical investigation was also carried out to study the effect of shoulder sizes on the ultimate uplift bearing capacity. It was observed that the fracture surface formed at the shoulder was convex and bullet-shaped. The analysis of results showed that the ultimate uplift bearing capacity of end bearing anchors was affected by enlargement diameter (D), shaft diameter (d) and enlargement segment length (L), especially with the enlargement shoulder dimension (D âˆ’ d). The model tests and numerical simulation results were compared with equations from the British and Chinese standards. When (D âˆ’ d)/L â‰¥ 0.2, Chinese standard was more suitable, and when (D âˆ’ d)/L < 0.2, British standard performed better. Finally, the effect of varying shoulder sizes and enlargement lengths were discussed, and some suggestions for better design of end bearing anchor were proposed to improve the anchorage efficiency."
"A nanodiamond voltage sensor: towards real-time, long-term neuronal sensing This project aims to develop a voltage sensor that may ultimately be used to measure neuronal signals
noninvasively in real-time and over hours. The project expects to generate the fundamental science needed to
use nanodiamonds for fluorescence-based voltage sensing that can be easily measured using optical microscopy.
The expected outcome is a biocompatible sensor that should provide a solution to one of the biggest challenges in
neuroscience; the fast, precise and long-term measurement of neuronal activity. This technology may one day
inform our understanding of how the normal brain works and provide major insights into mental health conditions
and neurodegenerative diseases."

"Properties enhancement of recycled aggregate concrete through pretreatment of coarse aggregates – Comparative assessment of assorted techniques Concrete Aggregates; Construction and Demolition Waste; Mechanical Properties In this study, the intrinsic properties of recycled coarse aggregates (RC), associated with bonded mortar, were modified with two different pretreatment techniques viz-a-viz HCl pretreatment and Na2SO4 pretreatment, while maintaining a fixed aggregate-to-solution ratio of 1:4.5. The residual bonded mortar was quantified to evaluate the potential of both techniques. HCl pretreatment yielded greater removal of bonded mortar content (BMC), almost twice as high as achieved by Na2SO4 pretreatment. Subsequently, the concretes were developed (termed as recycled aggregate concrete; RAC) by incorporating HCl treated coarse aggregates (HTC) and Na2SO4 treated coarse aggregates (STC). Both natural and recycled (untreated) fine aggregates (NF and RF, respectively) were used. Control specimens with natural coarse aggregates (NC) were prepared for comparative assessment. The resulting properties showed significantly influenced by bonded mortar content (BMC). About 14% higher compressive strength was achieved by using HTC in comparison with untreated RC, while a mere corresponding decline of 5% was seen when compared with NC. Likewise, the carbonation resistance and the resistance to chloride ion penetration showed better performance for HTC and STC incorporated concretes. Such superior performance is attributed to the denser interface (between the aggregate and paste matrix) with reduced pores/voids, as assessed from the optical and scanning electron microscopy. Further, the determined properties were used to develop regression models for the prediction of RAC properties. The prediction equations thus obtained showed remarked precision with the experimentally determined results, and as such these can be used for strength and durability prediction."
"Young People in Nursing Homes Tactile Tools Workshop and Insights Engagement The research has two main stages. Stage one is a Tactile Tools workshop that will bring together key stakeholders to understand the central roadblocks being faced by people in Newcastle with acquired brain injury (ABI) as they navigate the national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) and NSW healthcare system.

"Near infrared photoluminescence of ncvsi-centers in high-purity semi-insulating 4h-sic irradiated with energetic charged particles Color Centers; Nitrogen; Nanodiamonds This paper reports optical propertites of negatively charged NCVSi- centers in silicon carbide (a nitrogen substituting for a carbon atom adjacent to a silicon vacancy) whose emission wavlength is 1100-1500 nm at room temperature. High-purity semi-insulating (HPSI) 4H-SiCs are implanted with high energy N ion beams and subsequently thermally annealed to form NCVSi centers. We investigated a wide range of N ion implantation dose using a micro ion beam implantation technique and observed the photoluminescence intensity from the SiC-NV centers. We show that under conditions of heavy implantation, the excitation laser power excites residual defects and their fluorescences intereferes with the emission from the NCVSi- centers. These results allow us to clarify the requirements to optically detect isolated single NCVSi- centers at lightly implanted conditions."
"Accurate Underwater Optical Wireless Communication Model With Both Line-of-Sight and Non-Line-of-Sight Channels Bit Error Rate; Optical Wireless; Forward Error Correction Underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) systems have been widely studied to achieve high-speed wireless communications. To investigate and design UOWC systems, a mathematical model to characterize the accurate performance of UOWC systems is important. However, the previous mathematical models of UOWC systems have limitations, which mainly focused on the line-of-sight (LOS) link, and only considered the vertical incident background light or optical filters with constant transmittance for simplicity. To overcome these limitations, we establish an accurate UOWC system model, incorporating the previously overlooked impact of signal and sun lights incident angles and including both LOS and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels. Our proposed accurate UOWC system model is validated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Results show that our proposed model can capture the changes of received powers of both signal and background lights with various transmitter and receiver alignments and orientations in both LOS and NLOS channels, which typically affect the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) and bit-error-rate (BER) performance of UOWC systems. Furthermore, we show that the incident angles of both signal and sun lights have significant impact on the system performance, and our proposed model can be used to optimize the PD rotation angle to improve the SNR performance. Therefore, the more accurate UOWC channel model established in this paper provides a fundamental framework for future UOWC system design and optimization."

"Recycled cardboard trusses for housing construction Cardboards that are normally recycled post their utility have surprisingly high structural strengths per unit cross sectional area. However, their application similar to wooden materials has been limited in the past owing to their dimensional instability under certain loading conditions. In this project, an innovative approach to control the dimensional instability of cardboard sections will be developed from core engineering principles. This theoretical approach will be augmented by strengthening and testing cardboards in the laboratory. These strengthened sections with proper connections will be used to construct a truss. This proof-of-concept design and application will be tested to Australian Standard loading conditions in the laboratory and evaluated by industry partners with practical application to case study sites. Benefits of this project include a possible new approach to repurposing cardboard wastes, sustainability enhancement of saving the natural resource timber, reduction of cardboard landfill by about 20% in Victoria, and cheaper construction costs."

"An innovative structural fatigue monitoring solution for general aviation aircraft Helicopter; A-6 Aircraft; Airspace This article proposes a novel and effective solution for estimating fatigue life of General Aviation (GA) airframes using flight data produced by digital avionics systems, which are being installed or retrofitted into a growing number of GA aircraft. In the proposed implementation, a flight dynamics model is adopted to process the recorded flight data and to determine the dynamic loadings experienced by the aircraft. The equivalent loading cycles at fatigue-critical points of the primary structure are counted by means of statistical methods. For validation purposes, the developed approach is applied to flight data recorded by a fleet of Cessna 172S aircraft fitted with a Garmin G1000 integrated navigation and guidance system. Based on the initial experimental results and the developed uncertainty analysis, the proposed approach provides acceptable estimates of the residual fatigue life of the aircraft, thereby allowing a cost-effective and streamlined structural integrity monitoring solution. Future developments will address the possible adoption of the proposed method for unmanned aircraft structural health monitoring, also considering the accuracy enhancements achievable with advanced navigation and guidance architectures based on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) Sensors, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and Aircraft Dynamics Model (ADM) augmentation."

"Leaching of transition metal from spent Li-ion batteries (scholarship top-up Rakibul Qadir) Lithium-ion battery (LIB) in electronics and electric vehicles have been growing rapidly, resulting in boosting resources demand. In light of the significant quantity, potential environmental concern, high content of valuable resources, and limit carrying capacity of global reserves, the recycling of spent LIBs is highly desirable. Currently the overall recycling rate of Fe, Cu, AL, Co, Ni, and Mn are over 50%, and
the recycling rate of Li is less than 1%. These also reveal that the current recycling rate of the spent LIBs is still low and it is of need to develop the comprehensive and high-efficient process in the near future.
The project work program will involve:
a. Literature review of status of treatment of spent Li-ion batteries;
b. Identification and logical estimation of different types of lithium ion batteries in the local waste stream,
collect samples of spent Li-ion batteries from Bangladesh;
c. Crush and sieve this material into several size fractions for the test work – do this in Bangladesh,

"Developing a parametric spatial design framework for digital drumming Music; Violin; Clarinet This research operates at the intersection of music and spatial design within the context of improvised digital drumming. We outline a creative design research project founded on a series of affordance experiments that explore the ways in which the tools of spatial design can inform understandings of 'referent (Pressing 1987)' improvised patterns and phrases employed by experienced drummers. We outline the stages and process of development of a parametric computational framework using software from the spatial design industry to provide affordance (Gibson 1979) to understanding the complexities of drum improvisation. The 'ImprovSpace' Grasshopper script, operating within Rhino3DTM enables the 3D spatialization of digital drum-based improvisations wherein the parameters of drum notes, duration and velocity all can be flexibly manipulated. Drum phrases and patterns can be compared individually and clusters of repeated elements can be found within a larger corpus of improvisations. The framework enables insights into the specific attributes that constitute individual style including micro-timing, rubato and other elements of style. It is proposed that, by bringing these improvisations into visual and spatial domain in plan, elevation and isometric projections, a theoretic musico-perspectival hinge may be deconstructed that provides insights for visually and spatially dominant musicians within reflective, educational and other contexts."

"CASE STUDY Optimising the Marketing Strategies of Qantas and Thai Airways Aircraft; Airline Industry; Airfare First, there is brief review of the literature regarding airline marketing strategy, its components, code-share agreements, Business Model Canvas (BMC) and the benefits of marketing via strategic alliances. Due to the growth in the low-cost airlines sector and air transport passengers, traditional airlines have become increasingly exposed to a highly competitive international market, with airfares having to be reduced and efficiency increased. In response, airline companies have shifted their focus to investing in airline marketing and strategy research. In the meantime, passenger expectations change, and markets evolve rapidly. Hence, this case study is aimed at examining recent trends in passenger satisfaction and expectations, with reference to the marketing factors and airline cooperative strategies of Qantas and Thai Airways. For the study, both qualitative and quantitative approaches were employed and the results are presented separately. In the quantitative section, the BMCs of Qantas and Thai Airways are discussed to determine whether these two airlines can implement the code-sharing agreement. In the following part, customer satisfaction and expectations survey results are used to identify optimal marketing strategies and to formulate recommendations."

"The genetic basis of the anti-fungal activity of probiotic strains of Lactobacillus The use of microorganisms in agriculture is an expanding area of research, as it is becoming more evident that they play a large ro le in the overall health, and therefore yield, of both plants, and animals. They have the potentiaI to increase biomass, increase biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, and reduce disease in plants, as well being able to mediate the health of animals. Previously, several strains of Lactobacillus, which are currently used in a commercial formulation of microbial inoculant, were characterised for their antifungal activity aga in st plant pathogens. Several isolates demonstrated very strong anti-fungal activity in vitro, and some of the compounds identified may have positive effects on plant growth. Additionally, there is some evidence that these isolates also have positive effects on animal health. The goal of this project is to investigate some of the beneficial effects of Lactobacillus isolates."

"Mapping Scientific Concepts through Nature Play in Early Childhood Education:
Achieving Excellence in STEM through Evidence-Based Pedagogies.                     (Administered by Southern Cross) This project aims to determine how young children's (4-5 years) learning of scientific concepts can be supported through nature play. The increase of children attending kindergarten/preschool continues to rise markedly with 33g,243 Australian children enrolled. Coupled with this increase, is also the rapid surge of nature play pedagogies in kindergartens. The effectiveness though of nature play is untested,
making this the first study in the world to explicitly research nature play in early childhood education. This is significant because nature play is a core feature and tradition of early childhood education practice and pedagogy. This project will forge new knowledge about nature play pedagogies and how they can support children's scientific learning in early childhood education. Such research supports both the OLD Department of Education STEM Strategy (2016) and the National STEM Education Strategy (2016-2026) where ""it recognises the importance of a focus on STEM in the early years"" (p.5)."

"Solar Panels and Geotechnical Soil Slopes Integration Solar technology can be readily applied to the integration of solar panels with geotechnical slopes, such as slopes, embankments of traffic roads. The integration of solar panels on geotechnical slopes will have many advantages and benefits, such as increasing slope stability, reducing construction and maintenance costs, as well as producing clean electric power. 
While in most of solar power implementations, the solar panels are installed on roof tops, the installation of solar panels on geotechnical slopes or traffic embankment has additional benefits as a part of sustainable technology implementation.
This research project aims at investigating solar panels and geotechnical structure integration on Victoria railway and road embankments. The recent advancement in solar technology has made it economically viable to generate clean energy electricity on our public space such as embank slopes. Geotechnical benefit of installing solar panels to existing slopes/embankments includes reduction in rainwater infiltration into soil soils. Study has shown that 95% of slope instability were triggered by rainwater. Solar panels installed on slopes will reduce rainwater infiltration into the soils, so to protect the slope stability, and reduce maintenance costs. This concept can also be adopted in a new slope design using solar panels as an integrated component in a slope system.

"Varied Magnetic Phases in a van der Waals Easy-Plane Antiferromagnet Revealed by Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Microscopy Ferromagnetic Material; Ferromagnetism; Magnets Interest in van der Waals materials often stems from a desire to miniaturize existing technologies by exploiting their intrinsic layered structures to create near-atomically thin components that do not suffer from surface defects. One appealing property is an easily switchable yet robust magnetic order, which is only sparsely demonstrated in the case of in-plane anisotropy. In this work, we use widefield nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetic imaging to measure the properties of individual flakes of CuCrP2S6, a multiferroic van der Waals magnet known to exhibit weak easy-plane anisotropy in the bulk. We chart the crossover between the in-plane ferromagnetism in thin flakes down to the trilayer and the bulk behavior dominated by a low-field spin-flop transition. Further, by exploiting the directional dependence of NV center magnetometry, we are able to observe an instance of a predominantly out-of-plane ferromagetic phase near zero field, in contrast with our expectation and previous experiments on the bulk material. We attribute this to the presence of surface anisotropies caused by the sample preparation process or exposure to the ambient environment, which is expected to have more general implications for a broader class of weakly anisotropic van der Waals magnets."

"Developing BASEScope: a method to detect replication competent HIV for HIV cure research Despite the outstanding success of antiretroviral therapies for HIV infection, these drugs do not cure HIV and treatment is lifelong. Recent research has focussed on the possibility of a cure for HIV. The major barrier to HIV cure is the virus's ability to effectively 'hide' within tissues and blood in the infected individual. This virus lays dormant, effectively evading the immune system and antiretroviral therapy. Cessation of antiretroviral therapy allows the virus to rebound and the patient once again become viremic, potentially leading to HIV
disease progression. A major obstacle to clinical trials aimed at eliminating the virus from these dormant sites is the lack of assays/ technologies to quantitate and monitor the size and location of these sites effectively. HIV BaseScope offers a promising highly sensitive technology that can detect and quantify the virus present in these sites to guide the effectiveness of cure clinical trials."
Influenza A viral infection and pregnancy complications Pregnant women who contract influenza are 5 times more likely to be hospitalised than the general population. Babies of mothers with influenza are also associated with increased perinatal mortality rates. We hypothesise that influenza infection in pregnancy significantly impairs the maternal vascular system resulting in maternal and foetal morbidity. Outcomes from this research may change current treatment modalities to improve maternal and foetal outcomes complicated by influenza infection.
"Rapid translation of forensic data from police drug seizures into clinical alerts to improve
public health Illegal drug markets lack the quality control features of regulated product markets. For example, new psychoactive drugs often emerge and existing drug types frequently change strength or form. Optimal clinical responses to acute drug-related events should be tailored based on emerging information about these changing markets [1, 2].
Victoria Police Forensic Services are already resourced to locally monitor changes in drug markets through forensic analysis of all police seizures across the full spectrum of illegal drugs. These data are currently regularly shared within police networks and with researchers (e.g. lagged time-trend analysis [3]). However, they have not yet been shared rapidly with clinicians.
In order to maximise public-health value from Victoria Police Forensic Drug Intelligence Capability program, we will co-design, implement and evaluate the impact of rapid forensic intelligence alerts on clinical practice among frontline AOD workers and clinical resource managers."

"Everyday life after downshifting: Consumption, thrift, and inequality Practice Theory; Toilet Facilities; Water Much of the early literature on downshifting proposed that reduced hours at work would lead to reduced levels of consumption, increased hours of leisure, and a more sustainable and fulfilling life, and yet recent survey research has challenged these assumptions. Our study contributes knowledge on the differentially lived experience of contemporary downshifting and its relationship to sustainable and/or thrifty consumption. We undertook qualitative interviews with Australians of working age who had voluntarily reduced their hours of work in order to explore the everyday experience of downshifting and its links with consumption practices in the domains of food, leisure, and transport. These downshifters focused on thrift rather than sustainability and consequently did not reduce their consumption in a straightforward way. We found the everyday experience of downshifting was significantly shaped by caring responsibilities and financial and housing security. Moreover, differential levels of financial security affected consumption levels. Although those with lower levels of wealth closely managed discretionary expenditure, financially secure downshifters did not reduce their consumption overall. We argue that reduced working hours are unlikely to lead to reduced consumption in the absence of an ideological commitment to sustainability and without mainstream support for changing consumption mindsets and practices."

"Veteran workforce development: How veterans can make a positive impact on workforce development in the construction industry Personnel; Millennials; Baby Boomer Generation Hiring veterans is a valuable way through which the construction industry may overcome the workforce development challenges it faces. In spite of the several initiatives introduced by construction firms alongside the government and other stakeholders to take advantage of veteran talent, little research has been conducted to understand the impact of hiring veterans as workforce in the construction industry. Based on in-depth interviews with five veterans and one individual, all from the construction industry, this study sought to understand the positive impact hiring veterans can have on workforce development in the construction industry as well as the challenges associated with hiring veterans. According to the findings of the study, veterans possess unique skills and abilities that make them ideal for construction jobs: a strong work ethic, teamwork and leadership skills, organisation and the ability to develop action plans, resilience and problem solving skills, and cross-cultural competence."
"Regulatory mapping for future fuels Australia's gas infrastructure is subject to a range of regulations that are all designed for facilities that use natural gas.

"Contingency Release During Project Execution: The Contractor’s Decision-Making Dilemma Costs And Cost Analysis; Contingency; Case-Based Reasoning Risk is inherent in construction projects and managed through contingency. Dynamic management of contingency escrow accounts during project execution poses decision-making challenges. Project managers use key performance indicators (KPIs) for contingency release decisions. However, their subjective mental models influence risk perception, exacerbating the decision-making dilemma. This research integrates project KPIs with future risk perception to develop a mathematical model for facilitating such decision making. Results suggest timely completion, project cost, stakeholder satisfaction, quality and safety as top KPIs, and the influence of managerial pressure as a significant decision contributor. The proposed model helps project managers in dynamic decision making for cost contingency."

"Multi-sensor Optimal Data Fusion for INS/GNSS/CNS Integration Based on Unscented Kalman Filter Cubature; Kalman Filter; Maneuvering Target Tracking This paper presents an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) based multi-sensor optimal data fusion methodology for INS/GNSS/CNS (inertial navigation system/global navigation satellite system/celestial navigation system) integration based on nonlinear system model. This methodology is of two-level structure: at the bottom level, the UKF is served as local filters to integrate GNSS and CNS with INS respectively for generating the local optimal state estimates; and at the top level, a novel optimal data fusion approach is derived based on the principle of linear minimum variance for the fusion of local state estimates to obtain the global optimal state estimation. The proposed methodology refrains from the use of covariance upper bound to eliminate the correlation between local states. Its efficacy is verified through simulations, practical experiments and comparison analysis with the existing methods for INS/GNSS/CNS integration."

"Innovative home ownership models in Australia (21/PRO/53249) Innovative models of accessing secure, affordable, and sustainable housing have emerged in Australia in recent years. Each pursues unique pathways and outcomes, but these are frequently conflated by misunderstandings and misrepresentations. What are these models? How do they differ? Who do they house? Does current housing policy assist their emergence?

The research will map the current evidence regarding emerging innovative housing models in  Australia to produce the taxonomy of models. This will be supplemented by knowledge generated by the ECR investigator through approximately 120 interviews with project 
instigators, residents, professionals, and government agencies conducted between 2017 and 2020. Additionally, to understand the market segments attracted to innovative housing models, data from two recently completed surveys of future residents of innovative housing projects will be analysed. "

"Modelling Eye-Gaze Movement Using Gaussian Auto-regression Hidden Markov Saliency; Object Detection; Visual Attention Modelling and prediction of eye gaze movement can be highly desirable in many real-world scenarios, e.g. human-machine interaction and human behavior analysis. This challenging area largely remains unexplored. In this study we tackle this challenge and propose a method to predict eye-gaze movement of human observers. Eye gaze trajectories are separated into three components, where two of them are considered as noise or bias, which can be removed from the trajectory data. So the remaining component, principle movement, can be modelled by a proposed new method, GAR HMM, which stands for Gaussian Auto-regression Hidden Markov Model based on AR HMM. Instead of the Beta Processes in AR HMM, GAR HMM introduces a Gaussian Process. So the model can predict the probability of occurrence of eye gaze in each region over time. By joining the predicted points together as a sequence, we can generate the eye gaze movement prediction as a time series. To evaluate GAR HMM we collected eye gaze movement data from over 20 volunteers. Experiments show that good prediction can be achieved by our proposed GAR HMM method. As a groundbreaking work GAR HMM can lead to much further extension to benefit real applications."
"Polluters and access to informal finance - Is it important to go green? This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to shed light on the relationship between carbon risk and trade credit - a viable source of informal finance. Our study uncovers and tests two economic mechanisms through which carbon emission affects firms' informal financing channels: cash flow uncertainty and financial distress risk. We also investigate whether raising public awareness of a firm's
""green"" reputation, through its participation in the Green Power Partnership (GPP) program, helps reduce the information gap between itself and suppliers, thus protecting the firm from the potential adverse impact of carbon risk on a firm's access to trade credit."

"Targeting central inflammation to combat obesity and obesity-related cognitive dysfunction he current obesity epidemic means many of us will suffer from overweight or obesity for at least some of our lives. My findings show obesity can cause inflammation throughout the brain including in regions related to learning and memory.

"City Engine Project Urban infrastructure and systems (for example energy, transportation, telecommunications and water) are highly interdependent on each other to operate. Climate change and extreme weather events such as flash flooding, heatwaves, drought and bushfires are generating far-reaching flow-on effects across these systems. Many of these systems are privately owned and there is not a coordinated approach to mitigating the impacts of climate change on these systems. Identifying the interdependencies is the first step to bringing together government and private agencies to have an integrated approach to adaptation strategies.

Through this work, the City of Melbourne and its stakeholders will develop a better understanding of Melbourne’s urban system vulnerabilities, and develop improved methodologies for mapping urban system interdependencies.
Professor Rickards will work with City of Melbourne and its partners to lead this work."

"Bayesian prediction of emergency department wait time Varying Coefficient Model; Quantile Regression; High-Dimensional Increasingly, many hospitals are attempting to provide more accurate information about Emergency Department (ED) wait time to their patients. Estimation of ED wait time usually depends on what is known about the patient and also the status of the ED at the time of presentation. We provide a model for estimating ED wait time for prospective low acuity patients accessing information online prior to arrival. Little is known about the prospective patient and their condition. We develop a Bayesian quantile regression approach to provide an estimated wait time range for prospective patients. Our proposed approach incorporates a priori information in government statistics and elicited expert opinion. This methodology is compared to frequentist quantile regression and Bayesian quantile regression with non-informative priors. The test set includes 1, 024 low acuity presentations, of which 457 (44%) are Category 3, 425 (41%) are Category 4 and 160 (15%) are Category 5. On the Huber loss metric, the proposed method performs best on the test data for both median and 90th percentile prediction compared to non-informative Bayesian quantile regression and frequentist quantile regression. We obtain a benefit in the estimation of model coefficients due to the value contributed by a priori information in the form of elicited expert guesses guided by government wait time statistics. The use of such informative priors offers a beneficial approach to ED wait time prediction with demonstrable potential to improve wait time quantile estimates."

"Non-Combustibility of Concrete Firesafe UK has categorised building fires as the primary fire incidents with the most serious consequence. Recent devastating incidents with building fires around the world have raised an alarming concern on the use of new materials to meet the aesthetic, thermal and acoustic performance while the fire reaction of construction materials has not been carefully considered. Recent changes in the National Construction Code have reflected these concerns and the interest in developing scientific insight into materials performance during a fire.

Concrete has always been known to possess excellent thermal mass and a deemed-tosatisfy candidate as a non-combustibility construction material. However, the view of the broad society on concrete performance is limited and biased in comparison to other materials owing to other aspects of performance such as insulation and sustainability.

In this project, Innovative Fire & Facade Engineering group (IFFE) and Cement Concrete & Aggregates aim to conduct a series of tests to illustrate the performance and benefits of concrete as a building material in fire incidents. The tests are performed in accordance with
NCC 2019 or specifically designed to suit this purpose. A report will be generated at the end of the project to include (1) Testing procedure; (2) Results - in the form of either graphs, tables and/or video footage of conducted tests; and (3) Relevant recommendation in
accordance with NCC 2019 for concrete."
"Upcycling Domestic Food Waste: How To Make Better Compost, Faster Microbial decomposition of organic matter is the underlying mechanism that enables us to reduce the volume of our domestic food waste and transform it into valuable compost. This upcycled product can enhance the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, enabling us to grow healthier plants and tastier food in our urban environment. There is widespread understanding of the conditions conducive to microbial decomposition of organic matter. Internal factors (physical and chemical composition of the food waste; size, activity and composition of the microbial community) and external factors (temperature, water content, aeration, additives) all play a role. This research will explore which factors are the most important to this specific application: home composting in urban Australia. Further, the project will seek to develop recommendations as to how these factors can be optimized to produce compost faster. A replicated factorial experimental design will alter individual factors and combinations of factors.  The approach will be grounded in the needs and realities of the industry serving the home compost market, with a combination of laboratory and full-scale field trials. "

"Highly Selective CO2 Gas Sensing Properties of CaO-BaTiO3 Heterostructures Effectuated through Discretely Created n-n Nanointerfaces Carbon Dioxide; Work Functions; Gas Globally recognized for its role as an occupational hazard, carbon dioxide (CO2) detection and monitoring is essential in agriculture, chemical manufacturing, and healthcare/clinical-oriented applications. Although, optical and chemical gas sensors are available commercially, current gas sensing technologies involving selective monitoring of CO2 at lower detection limits specifically for industrial conditions still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a simple strategy for highly selective CO2 detection using an inexpensive transducer platform based on reversible chemisorbed carbonation between CO2 and CaO-BaTiO3 heterostructures. Microsensors showed an optimum sensitivity of 65% toward 1000 ppm of CO2 gas and superior selectivity when operated at 160 Â°C. Such a remarkable sensing performance originates from the discretely created n-n nanointerfaces and conveniently actualized staggered energy band positions that promote favorable charge transfer upon exposure to CO2 gas molecules even at parts per million levels. Reversible sensing phenomenon is demonstrated using operando time-resolved diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and correlated with energy band alignment determined from the ultraviolet diffuse reflectance (UV-DRS) spectra to propose the sensing mechanism."

"Surface Dynamics and Ligand-Core Interactions of Quantum Sized Photoluminescent Gold Nanoclusters Fluorescence; Metal Clusters; Icosahedron Quantum-sized metallic clusters protected by biological ligands represent a new class of luminescent materials; yet the understanding of structural information and photoluminescence origin of these ultrasmall clusters remains a challenge. Herein we systematically study the surface ligand dynamics and ligand-metal core interactions of peptide-protected gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) with combined experimental characterizations and theoretical molecular simulations. We show that the peptide sequence plays an important role in determining the surface peptide structuring, interfacial water dynamics and ligand-Au core interaction, which can be tailored by controlling peptide acetylation, constituent amino acid electron donating/withdrawing capacity, aromaticity/hydrophobicity and by adjusting environmental pH. Specifically, emission enhancement is achieved through increasing the electron density of surface ligands in proximity to the Au core, discouraging photoinduced quenching, and by reducing the amount of surface-bound water molecules. These findings provide key design principles for understanding the surface dynamics of peptide-protected nanoparticles and maximizing the photoluminescence of metallic clusters through the exploitation of biologically relevant ligand properties."

"Numerical simulation of flow past a triangular prism with fluid–structure interaction Reynolds Number; Nusselt Number; Mixed Convection Fluid flows around a pointed object, e.g. the flow around a triangular prism, are often encountered. In this study, numerical simulation of the flow around a triangular prism was carried out using COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ® software. Two cases were considered: the entire area of the triangular prism is fixed; and only the center is fixed. The first case is divided into three different flow models according to the flow state: the separation bubble model, the edge separation model and the attached flow model. The effects of different flow models on the lift coefficient, drag coefficient and Strouhal number were discussed from the perspective of fluid flow. For the second case, the triangular prism periodically rotates while the vortices are separated from the surface. It was found that a stable rotation stage exists after a certain period of time for prisms with different initial positions. The lift and drag coefficients of the triangular prism satisfy the jagged and sinusoidal variation."

"Artificial Intelligence in food system redesign ? Designing for the benefit of the whole (Student: Stephanie Camarena) The future of humanity is urban with a predicted 66% of people living in cities by 2050. However, with the sprawl of cities, agricultural knowledge is lost and the disconnection from the source of food growing emphasises issues of waste, resilience, food security and health. Climate change is adversely impacting the production of food in Australia whether in terms of quantity, quality and altogether availability.

Providing alternative and sustainable food systems requires an increased connectivity between demand and supply, the valorisation of local products, stewardship and local knowhow. Better models and techniques could support a way for local consumption to more closely match the production available or the production capacity in urban and peri-urban areas.

The research will develop a model based on a series of case studies using artificial intelligence (AI) applied to different parts of the food system. The system design thinking methods will allow observations and findings on how redesigning part of the food system can
improve the benefits of the whole and how adopting a service system design from the start might change the problem formulation. The proposed model could help evaluate city food policies and future planning and bring a clearer understanding of how habits and purchases
are directly linked to sustainable outcomes."
"Predicting separation selectivity of porous materials for CO2 capture Dr Ravichandar Babarao is an ARC DECRA fellow of RMIT who joined the university recently from CSIRO. Dr Babarao developed significant expertise while in CSIRO in modelling of porous materials for various functional uses. On joining RMIT, Dr Babarao and RMIT entered into a Visiting Scientist agreement and collaboration agreement to cover his ongoing general collaboration with CSIRO. Under that agreement, the potential for CSIRO to subcontract Dr Babarao through RMIT for commercial work was identified, as was the need for those contracts to be handled according to their own specific conditions especially WRT IP given the needs of the commercial contracts. The existing Visitors and Collaboration agreement is attached for reference (TRIM CON 2016/02823).

This project has arisen as a result of that need, reflecting a requirement for CSIRO to access Dr Babarao¿s expertise as
a subcontractor to a particular project with CSIRO.

The project involves mathematical modelling to screen porous materials for their capacity to selectively capture CO2.
CSIRO will specify the materials to be screened and conditions, and Dr Babarao will conduct research to identify priority targets."
"A framework for assessing agricultural extension approaches and an analysis of transferrable public health approaches. This project will generate practical insights and actionable recommendations for how ACIAR programs can better integrate cutting-edge agricultural practice change and community engagement praxis. The project will first review the extensive peer-reviewed literature from the Mekong region in order to create a framework that compares different models and approaches and their strengths
and weaknesses. This will be done for both the fields of public health and agricultural extension in order to explore areas for cross-disciplinary learning.

"Growing ZnO nanoparticles on polydopamine-templated cotton fabrics for durable antimicrobial activity and UV protection Cotton Fabrics; Ultraviolet Protection Factor; Silver Nanoparticle This work aims to develop durable functional cotton fabrics by growing zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles on polydopamine (PDA) templates. ZnO nanoparticles were grown on the PDA-templated cotton fabrics by the hydrothermal method at room temperature. The surface morphology, chemical composition, and crystalline structure of the ZnO-coated cotton fabrics were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The ZnO nanoparticles were found to disperse evenly on the surface of cotton fabrics. The ultraviolet (UV) protection factor (UPF) value of the ZnO-coated cotton fabrics was maintained at 122.5, and 99% reduction in bacterial load was observed against Gluconobacter cerinus even after five cycles of laundering. The PDA was found to be effective in fixing the ZnO seeds tightly on the surface of cotton fabrics, resulting in excellent durability of the coating of ZnO nanoparticles."

"Screening dietary fibres for fermentation characteristics and metabolic profiles using a rapid in vitro approach: Implications for irritable bowel syndrome Intestine Flora; Prebiotic Agent; Fructans The therapeutic value of specific fibres is partly dependent on their fermentation characteristics. Some fibres are rapidly degraded with the generation of gases that induce symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), while more slowly or non-fermentable fibres may be more suitable. More work is needed to profile a comprehensive range of fibres to determine suitability for IBS. Using a rapid in vitro fermentation model, gas production and metabolite profiles of a range of established and novel fibres were compared. Fibre substrates (n 15) were added to faecal slurries from three healthy donors for 4 h with gas production measured using real-time headspace sampling. Concentrations of SCFA and ammonia were analysed using GC and enzymatic assay, respectively. Gas production followed three patterns: rapid (â‰¥60 ml/g over 4 h) for fructans, carrot fibre and maize-derived xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS); mild (30-60 ml/g) for partially hydrolysed guar gum, almond shell-derived XOS and one type of high-amylose resistant starch 2 (RS2) and minimal (no differences with blank controls) for methylcellulose, another high-amylose RS2, acetylated or butyrylated RS2, RS4, acacia gum and sugarcane bagasse. Gas production correlated positively with total SCFA (r 0Â·80, P < 0Â·001) and negatively with ammonia concentrations (r -0Â·68, P < 0Â·001). Proportions of specific SCFA varied: fermentation of carrot fibre, XOS and acetylated RS2 favoured acetate, while fructans favoured butyrate. Gas production and metabolite profiles differed between fibre types and within fibre classes over a physiologically relevant 4-h time course. Several fibres resisted rapid fermentation and may be candidates for clinical trials in IBS patients."

"Pre-processed fruits as raw materials: part I – different forms, process conditions and applications Thin-Layer Drying; Drying; Solar Dryers Fruit crops are valuable commodities considering both processed as well as pre-processed products. Current consumer trends have created a huge demand for fruit-based products to improve nutritional wellbeing. In order that the processing industry may deliver the products with their full potential, it is necessary to have an uninterrupted supply of raw materials to eliminate the bottlenecks. Most fruits are perishable and available seasonally so it is difficult to have a continuous supply of the fruits. Hence, to overcome the issues associated with seasonal availability an alternate practice for the processing of fruits up to an intermediate level can be adapted to give a continuous supply of pre-processed fruit products. This review article discusses the processing conditions for different fruits, the commonly associated problems with the processing and their applications."

"Population balance modeling for air–water bubbly flow in a vertical U-bend Bubble; Void Fraction; Two Phase Flow Bubbly flow in U-bend is widely encountered in two-phase flow systems because of its compactness and high heat transfer coefficient. The modeling of phase distributions, velocity fields, and interfacial area concentration in the U-bend is crucial for the analysis of mass, momentum, and energy transportation processes in the equipment. However, this subject has not received enough attention yet. In this paper, the combination of population balance model and two-fluid model was used in the simulation of airâ€“water bubbly flow in a U-bend with 24 mm inner diameter and 96 mm curvature. The homogeneous multiple size group model was used to solve the population balance equation and reconstruct the bubble size distribution function. The phase distribution at 0Â°, 90Â°, and 180Â° was predicted and the results showed that the superficial velocities of gas and liquid phase were the control parameters. Under higher gas superficial velocity, the buoyant force is dominant and makes the bubbles concentrate on the outer side of the tube wall; while under lower gas superficial velocity, the centrifugal force is dominant and makes the bubbles concentrate on the inner side of the tube wall. These results met well with the experimental results of Usui."

"Tunable nonlinear bending behaviors of functionally graded graphene origami enabled auxetic metamaterial beams Hamilton's Principle; Postbuckling; Carbon Nanotube This paper investigates tunable nonlinear bending behaviors of functionally graded composite beams made of graphene origami (GOri)-enabled auxetic metal metamaterials (GOEAMs) within the theoretical framework of the first-order shear deformation theory and von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n type nonlinearity. The beam is comprised of multiple GOEAM layers with GOri content and folding degree being variables to effectively control its auxetic property that is graded from layer to layer across its thickness direction. Our developed genetic programming (GP)-assisted micromechanical models are used to estimate the position- and temperature-dependent Poisson's ratio and other material properties of each GOEAM layer in the beam. The nonlinear governing equations of the FG-GOEAM beam are derived by the principle of virtual work and numerically solved by the differential quadrature (DQ) method. A detailed parametric investigation is conducted to examine the effects of GOri content, folding degree, and temperature on the tunability of the nonlinear bending deflection and normal stress of the FG metamaterial beam. Numerical results offer significant insights into the design of FG-GOEAM beam structures with enhanced bending performances."

"Cooperative fusion based passive multistatic radar detection Spectrum Sensing; Cognitive Radio; Energy Detection Passive multistatic radars have gained a lot of interest in recent years as they offer many benefits contrary to conventional radars. Here in this research, our aim is detection of target in a passive multistatic radar system. The system contains a single transmitter and multiple spatially distributed receivers comprised of both the surveillance and reference antennas. The system consists of two main parts: 1. Local receiver, and 2. Fusion center. Each local receiver detects the signal, processes it, and passes the information to the fusion center for final detection. To take the advantage of spatial diversity, we apply major fusion techniques consisting of hard fusion and soft fusion for the case of multistatic passive radars. Hard fusion techniques are analyzed for the case of different local radar detectors. In terms of soft fusion, a blind technique called equal gain soft fusion technique with random matrix theory-based local detector is analytically and theoretically analyzed under null hypothesis along with the calculation of detection threshold. Furthermore, six novel random matrix theory-based soft fusion techniques are proposed. All the techniques are blind in nature and hence do not require any knowledge of transmitted signal or channel information. Simulation results illustrate that proposed fusion techniques increase detection performance to a reasonable extent compared to other blind fusion techniques."

"In situ transmission electron microscopy with biasing and fabrication of asymmetric crossbars based on mixed-phased a-VOx Oxygen Vacancy; Random Access Memory; Memristors Resistive switching crossbar architecture is highly desired in the field of digital memories due to low cost and high-density benefits. Different materials show variability in resistive switching properties due to the intrinsic nature of the material used, leading to discrepancies in the field because of underlying operation mechanisms. This highlights a need for a reliable technique to understand mechanisms using nanostructural observations. This protocol explains a detailed process and methodology of in situ nanostructural analysis as a result of electrical biasing using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It provides visual and reliable evidence of underlying nanostructural changes in real time memory operations. Also included is the methodology of fabrication and electrical characterizations for asymmetric crossbar structures incorporating amorphous vanadium oxide. The protocol explained here for vanadium oxide films can be easily extended to any other materials in a metal-dielectric-metal sandwiched structure. Resistive switching crossbars are predicted to serve the programmable logic and neuromorphic circuits for next-generation memory devices, given the understanding of the operation mechanisms. This protocol reveals the switching mechanism in a reliable, timely, and cost-effective way in any type of resistive switching materials, and thereby predicts the device's applicability."

"Pilot Study into the Design of Toileting Device for Women Wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Improvement of Health and Wellbeing One of the challenges that appears to be relevant to a number of industries where female workers are required to wear PPE and other similar specialized gear, as well as to work for prolonged periods of time in situations that are remote or are without toilet facilities, is the ability to comfortably, safely and discretely urinate without significant disrobing and disarming. In the present situation, a women’s inability to toilet as needed, can lead them to making decisions to significantly decrease their fluid intake for prolonged periods of time and to being continuously conscious about their condition. This potentially could lead to the decrease in mental and health wellbeing, cognitive ability, dehydration, susceptibility to urinary tract infections and other health hazards, such as bladder stones and reduced kidney function, as well as to reduction in safety and productivity. 
The present activity will compliment the medical study in the field of human centred design by closely looking into """"state of the art"""" devices that are currently available and identifying the paths forward in terms of a wearable design solution. We will conduct a number of focus groups with women in the target group to understand more deeply their human experience and ideal solutions (CHEAN will be applied for in advance of this stage). The team will consist of O.Troynikov and Leah Heiss (The Design Team) with the support of PhDs and ECRs with relevant expertise and interests, where feasible.

"Mechanical performance of glued-in rod glulam beam to column moment connection: An experimental study Wood Beams; Glulam; Timber Engineered timber elements are gaining wide acceptance in construction with the increased practice of mass timber structures. The design of moment resistance connection is a contentious issue amongst practitioners and researchers. However, studies available on the performance of timber frame moment resisting connections made of various engineered timber sections are quite limited. This paper presents the outcome of a research study on the experimental assessment of the mechanical performance of a glued in rod (GIR) to glue laminated timber (GLT) beam to column moment connection. The research was carried in two stages: (1) investigating the pull-out behaviour of a GIR embedded in GLT and (2) verification of a full scale GLT moment connection using GIRs. The results of GIR pull-out testing revealed that the failure is mostly characterised by interface (GIR to GLT) shear bond delamination and slippage. Rod slip failure mode in the GLT was also observed in the full-scale connection tests. Subsequently, using the experimental data gathered in the two stages of testing, a simple approach to estimate the moment capacity of full-scale connection using three parameters and an analytical approach to estimate the rotational stiffness of GIR to GLT connection are presented. Furthermore, existing design formulations to predict the moment capacities of GIR to GLT are compared with the experimental data. The study enables a better understanding of the mechanical performance of a GIR to GLT moment resistance connection. Further, studies are needed with different parameters that influence the behaviour of GIR to GLT connections."
"SME in collaboration with Montague Fresh
 Circular fruit waste project Organic waste, predominantly apple, pear and stone fruit is currently produced as a by-product of Montague Fresh production operations. These wastes are disposed of in landfill or as feed at a significant cost, currently Montague fresh dispose of approximately 500 tonnes of waste at a cost of around $50000 PA.
Production of valuable ingredients and/or products from this waste would be a desirable outcome in terms of environmental impact as well as a significant cost reduction. Waste reduction may be achieved via the development of ready to use powders and purees or development of healthy convenient snacks. Another promising avenue of utilising this type of waste is the extraction of valuable compounds and nutraceuticals such as pectin and soluble or insoluble fibre.

"Effectiveness of music therapy for autism spectrum disorder, dementia, depression, insomnia and schizophrenia: update of systematic reviews Dance Therapy; Dancing; Parkinson Disease Background: Music therapy (MT) aims at maintaining, restoring and furthering physical/emotional/mental health. This review assesses effectiveness of MT and its methods for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), dementia, depression, insomnia and schizophrenia. Methods: A search for systematic reviews and health technology assessment reports was conducted and yielded 139 hits. Given the large amount, we focused on five frequent diagnostic groups with available Cochrane reviews. A second search was conducted in four databases. Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and assessed methodological quality. Only trials with moderate/low risk of bias (RoB) were selected. Results: Ten randomized controlled trials (1.248 participants) met inclusion criteria. For schizophrenia, no studies with low/moderate RoB were found; therefore, updating was not possible. The Cochrane authors stated that quality of life (QoL), social functioning, global/mental state improved for schizophrenia, but not global functioning. For ASD, MT improved behaviour, social communication, brain connectivity and parent-child relationship. For depression, mood was enhanced, and for insomnia, sleep quality, stress, anxiety, total sleep time, disease severity and psychological QoL improved. MT positively affected mood, neuropsychiatric behaviour, apathy, communication and physical functions for dementia; behavioural/psychological symptoms improved only in severe, and memory and verbal fluency only in mild Alzheimer's disease. Cognition improved for dementia in one of four studies. Both active (playing music) and receptive (listening to music) methods were used for dementia, whereas for ASD and depression, active methods were applied. For insomnia, only receptive methods were used. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that MT helps patients improving their physical/psychosocial health. More research investigating long-term effects is needed."

assessment (Lead CI: PhD student Ms Chantel Foord) Marine ecosystems are under major threat from the anthropogenic release of chemical pollutants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and trace metals. Marine mammals are used globally as sentinels for ecosystem health and function, as top-order predators with long life-cycles they provide information on the bio-accumulation and magnification of toxicants within the ecosystems in which they live. Further, elevated levels of contaminants such as POPs and trace metals have been linked to adverse effects on the reproduction, endocrine and immune systems in marine mammals world-wide. "
"Indigenous Leadership at the Corporate Accountability Symposium, November 2018 How businesses conduct themselves and impact communities, workers, consumers and other stakeholders shapes our world. The importance of fostering sound human rights practices in business and providing redress when rights are breached is gaining increasing recognition in Australia and globally.  We seek funding for a Corporate Accountability Symposium and research to ensure that Indigenous concerns around corporate accountability are central to the Symposium. 

CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY SYMPOSIUM, NOVEMBER 2018

A two-day Corporate Accountability Symposium will be held in November 2018, organised by the Australian Corporate Accountability Network.  The Symposium will bring international experts as well as indigenous groups from overseas and within Australia together with policy makers and key partner organisations in Australia to set a policy agenda for business and human rights in Australia.  The aim of this funding is to ensure that indigenous concerns are at the centre of policy development.  The first day will bring state and federal policy makers together to progress the business and human rights policy that was agreed between business and civil society through the Australian Government’s Multi-Stakeholder Advisory Group on Business and Human Rights that the Australian government abandoned in 2017.  The second day of the Symposium will be open to the public.  The Symposium aligns with the Social Change priority area of Transformations in health and social policy and practice. Funds will be used to fly indigenous Australians to the Symposium and bring international experts to Australia.  Side events at RMIT will be organised, also, to develop RMIT staff and student knowledge of indigenous concerns around corporate accountability and build ties with international and Australian experts.

"Influence of drying temperatures and storage parameters on the physicochemical properties of spray-dried infant milk formula powders Milk Protein Concentrate; Dried Milk; Particle Size The influence of spray drier inlet (180 and 200 Â°C) and outlet (80, 90 and 100 Â°C) air temperatures and storage parameters (22 and 40 Â°C, and 11%, 23% and 54% RH, for 6 months) on the characteristics of infant milk formula (IMF) powders was investigated. The combination of inletâ€“outlet temperatures affected the moisture content, water activity, particle size and glass transition temperature (Tg) in the freshly spray-dried IMF powders, whereas, powder surface composition and morphology were not affected. Powders remained stable for 6 months at 11 and 23% RH at both storage temperatures. Storage at 54% RH (at both storage temperatures) increased the moisture uptake by powders, decreased Tg below storage temperature, induced lactose crystallisation, increased surface fat and caking of powders, and reduced powder solubility. This study shows that inletâ€“outlet temperature combinations used during spray drying affect the stability of powders during storage by affecting their initial moisture content."
"The effect of toxicants and microplastics on the health of waterbirds (PhD candidate Damien Nzabanita) Small plastics are major global pollutants, ubiquitous in aquatic and freshwater ecosystems (Peters, 2018). The amount of microplastics (MPs) in the aquatic ecosystem continues to increase and they have been found in different aquatic animals such as fish, penguins and ducks.
Waterbirds suffer due to the number of MPs that build up in their systems. Their morbidity and mortality rates are accelerating faster than in any other bird group, and MPs in the aquatic ecosystem are considered a cause. MPs have many adverse effects on these aquatic animals (Wilcox et al., 2015). According to Verlis et al. , 1013; Wright et al., 2013 and de Sa, 2018, ecotoxicological effects on aquatic animals can be biological, chemical and physical. These adverse effects include: behavioral changes, reproductive impairment, oxidative damage and stress, blockage of the gastrointestinal tract leading to alteration and translocation of the circulatory system, starvation and death.
To date, a few studies in Australia have assessed the presence, abundance and effects of microplastics in aquatic environments. However, not of all them are significant, and these studies have not studied the effects of MPs on the health of waterbirds."

"Gaining resolution when creating imagery of aging Co-Design; Human-Computer Interaction (HCI); Idea Generation In seeking to support healthy aging, designers have struggled to reduce their assumptions and biases toward older adults, been seen to interpret the worlds of later life through unfiltered imagery, as well as engage with stigmas, ultimately diminishing the technologies they construct. This article seeks to critically analyse this state-of-the-art from a design research perspective while engaging with the growing interdisciplinary study of aging and technologies. Toward this, we proposition â€œresolutionâ€ as a concept indicative of the level of detail that seeks to characterize the fidelity that representations of later life have. This concept is explored through a cultural probe study that investigated the sentiments of several older Australians regarding the inequities and social isolation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a diary alongside photovoice and mapping tasks, the study captured perceptions of social technology, practices, networks, and wellbeing, offering a diverse and complex picture of aging and technology. Through reflexive thematic analyses of some of these materials, this case study offers designers pathways to understanding and including older adults in their work. In determining the resolution of these images of aging, we discuss how transparency about the limitations and qualities of such participatory methods through incorporating reflexivity can influence the degree of detail such imagery gains. Ultimately this concept builds on the notion of participation configuration, supporting designers to realize better images of aging and representations of later life."
"Harnessing algae for high rate municipal wastewater treatment: developing immobilised algae systems (student Matthew Kube) In this project, algae in suspended, biofilm and immobilised systems will be compared for their

"Generating nonlinearities from conditional linear operations, squeezing, and measurement for quantum computation and super-Heisenberg sensing Quantum Fisher Information; Metrology; Photon Large bosonic or continuous variable nonlinearities can have numerous applications, ranging from the generation of cat states for quantum computation, through to quantum sensing where the sensitivity exceeds Heisenberg scaling in the resources. However, the generation of ultra-large nonlinearities has proved immensely challenging experimentally. We describe a novel protocol where one can effectively generate large Kerr-type nonlinearities via the conditional application of a linear operation on an optical mode by an ancilla mode, followed by a measurement of the ancilla and corrective operation on the probe mode. Our protocol can generate high-quality SchrÃ¶dinger cat states useful for quantum computing and can be used to perform sensing of an unknown rotation or displacement in phase space, with super-Heisenberg scaling in the resources. We finally describe a potential experimental implementation using atomic ensembles interacting with optical modes via the Faraday effect."
"Impact of Thermospheric Mass Density on the Orbit Prediction of LEO Satellites Thermosphere; Drag; Magnetic Storms Many thermospheric mass density (TMD) variations have been recognized in observations and physical simulations; however, their impact on the low-Earth-orbit satellites has not been fully evaluated. The present study investigates the quantitative impact of periodic spatiotemporal TMD variations modulated by the empirical DTM2013 model. Also considered are two small-scale variations, that is, the equatorial mass anomaly and the midnight density maximum, which are reproduced by the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model. This investigation is performed through a 1-day orbit prediction (OP) simulation for a 400-km circular orbit. The results show that the impact of TMD variations during solar maximum is 1 order of magnitude larger than that during solar minimum. The dominant impact has been found in the along-track direction. Semiannual and semidiurnal variations in TMD exert the most significant impact on OP among the intra-annual and intradiurnal variations, respectively. The zero mean periodic variations in TMD may not significantly affect the predicted orbit but increase the orbital uncertainty if their periods are shorter than the time span of OP. Additionally, the equatorial mass anomaly creates a mean orbit difference of 50 m (5 m) with a standard deviation of 30 m (3 m) in 1-day OP during high (low) solar activity. The midnight density maximum exhibits a stronger impact in the order of 150Â±30 and 15Â±6 m during solar maximum and solar minimum, respectively. This study makes clear that careful selection of TMD variations is of great importance to balance the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy in OP problems."

"Influence of direct deposition of dielectric materials on the optical response of monolayer WS2 Molybdenum Disulfide; Monolayer; Van Der Waals We investigate the effects of direct deposition of different dielectric materials (AlOx, SiOx, SiNx) onto atomically thin TMDC WS2 on its optical response using atomic layer deposition (ALD), electron beam evaporation (EBE), plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and magnetron sputtering. The photoluminescence measurements reveal quenching of the excitonic emission after all deposition processes, which is linked to the increased level of charge doping and associated rise of the trion emission and/or the localized (bound) exciton emission. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy allows us to clearly correlate the observed changes in excitonic emission with the increased levels of lattice disorder and defects. In particular, we show that the different doping levels in a monolayer WS2 capped by a dielectric material are strongly related to the defects in the WS2 crystal introduced by all capping methods, except for ALD. The strong charge doping in the ALD-capped sample seems to be caused by other factors, such as deviations in the dielectric layer stoichiometry or chemical reactions on the monolayer surface, which makes ALD distinct from all other techniques. Overall, the EBE process results in the lowest level of doping and defect densities and in the largest spectral weight of the exciton emission in the PL. Sputtering is revealed as the most aggressive dielectric capping method for WS2, fully quenching its optical response. Our results demonstrate and quantify the effects of direct deposition of dielectric materials onto monolayer WS2, which can provide valuable guidance for the efforts to integrate monolayer TMDCs into functional optoelectronic devices."

"Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Analytics on Medical Time Series Data Network Protocol; Secure Multi-Party Computation; Privacy Preserving Medical time series data analytics based on dynamic time warping (DTW) greatly benefits modern medical research. Driven by the distributed nature of medical data, the collaboration of multiple healthcare institutions is usually necessary for a sound medical conclusion. Among others, a typical use case is disease screening for public health, where multiple healthcare institutions wish to collaboratively detect over their joint datasets the patients whose medical records have similar features to the given query samples. However, sharing the medical data faces critical privacy obstacles with the increasingly strict legal regulations on data privacy. In this article, we present the design of a novel system enabling privacy-preserving DTW-based analytics on distributed medical time series datasets. Our system is built from a delicate synergy of techniques from both cryptography and data mining domains, where the key idea is to leverage observations on the advancements in plaintext DTW analytics (e.g., clustering and pruning) to facilitate the scalable computation in the ciphertext domain, through our tailored security design. Extensive experiments over real medical time series datasets demonstrate the promising performance of our system, e.g., our system is able to process a secure DTW query computation over 15K time series sequences in 34 minutes."

"Monte Carlo localisation of a mobile robot using a Doppler–Azimuth radar Robot; Grid Maps; Mobile Robots This paper investigates the moving robot localisation problem using a Dopplerâ€“Azimuth radar array. The solution is formulated in the framework of nonlinear/non-Gaussian estimation using a particle filter and a random finite set (RFS) model of measurements. The proposed approach assumes the availability of a feature-based map, radar measurements and robot odometry data. The associations between the measurements and the features of the map (landmarks) are unknown. The RFS model is adopted to deal with false and missed detections and uses Murty's algorithm to reduce computation when solving the association problem. The proposed particle filter incorporates the Kullbackâ€“Leibler Distance (KLD)-Sampling to reduce computational time. Monte-Carlo simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm."

"Odour removal from scum Odorous emission from the wastewater treatment plant include both organic and inorganic gases and vapours. The anerobic decomposition of organic matter is mainly responsible to release gases that mostly contains H2S, NH3, CO2, and CH4. Among these, H2S and NH3 are strongly malodorous. In addition, compounds such as mercaptans and other organic sulphides and amines such as indole and skatole, which are highly malodorous are also present at lower concentration in the sludge. The monoaromatic compounds and aldehydes are also the main contributors for odour generation in the wastewater treatment plants. The odours originating from treatment plant is' nuisance to surrounding neighbourhood which requires to be controlled.
Currently different odour removal techniques are available out of which, chemical conditioning is the most cost-effective technique. The different chemical compounds used are mainly Iron salts, Bioxide, Oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide, Anthraquinone, lime, and NaHCO3. Among the different chemical compounds, lime is known as the most cost-effective chemical used for odour removal from
biosolids. "
"Changes in the content and antioxidative activity of β-carotene and its metabolite vitamin A during gastrointestinal digestion and absorption and optimisation of HPLC-based detection Carotenoids; Retinol; Ipomoea Batatas The Î²-Carotene (BC), an important precursor of vitamin A (VA), possesses antioxidant activity but is fat-soluble and has low bioavailability. In previous in-vitro assays evaluating antioxidant and 2,2â€²-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) free radical scavenging, both BC and VA showed a strong ability to scavenge radicals and protected cells from oxidative stress. Here, we used artificially simulated gastrointestinal digestion and Caco-2 cell absorption models to evaluate the bioavailability of the BC during gastrointestinal digestion and absorption using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. We observed high absorptive and transfer rates of BC and detected retinol metabolites (Vitamin A). Therefore, BC can be detected in the acidic gastrointestinal environment using HPLC. Optimised method provided better separation of BC and VA in the column, improving the accuracy of the test results."
"Optical imaging of organic pollutants: Real time detection and identification Phenanthrenes; Bioremediation; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are recalcitrant pollutants that can induce carcinogenic, hazardous and mutagenic effects in living organisms. Numerous traditional methods are available for their identification, but these methods require large samples and are time-consuming. In this study we have developed a new method for the determination of PAHs by exploiting their intrinsic fluorescence characteristics. The aim of this research is to investigate real time identification of different PAHs including; Naphthalene, Pyrene and Phenanthrene by using their autofluorescence properties. These pollutants have shown specific optical signatures that are useful for their rapid detection in the contaminated area. In addition to their specific emission spectra, lifetime analysis also can be used to distinguish PAHs with high level of certainty. Our research offers new avenues for real time detection of pollutants."
"Police practice and false confessions: A search for the implementation of investigative interviewing in Australia Confession; Suggestibility; Police Since the 1960s, the United States developed â€˜Reid interrogation techniqueâ€™, and its variations have been widely used around the world. Due to its interrogative and confession-driven nature â€“ and thus the increased risk of false confessions â€“ many countries (including Australia) have since moved away from this model towards the UK-developed PEACE-approach. This article will utilise case studies and forensic psychological research to explain how coercive techniques used during police interviews increase the risk of false confessions. It will then describe the implementation of investigative interviewing in Australia by presenting an analysis of those state and territory police manuals which are publicly available."

"Biofabricating complex synthetic skin structures (PhD candidate: Emily Liu s3862245) Skin is the largest organ of the human body, and is responsible for several functions vital to human survival, such as barrier protection, homeostatic modulation, and sensory function. Understanding skin’s response to external stimuli (including disease, and topically applied drugs and chemicals) is a perennial question across clinical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields. Historically animal models have been used for most of this testing, but this usage has declined in recent years owing to ethical concerns and the introduction of ‘3R’ (Replace, Reduce, Refine) legislation across most of the globe in the early 2000s. In vitro skin models have emerged as a more sustainable, humane and human-relevant alternative to animal testing. Whilst there are number of commercially available synthetic skin models, these models have not obtained the complex anatomical and physiological features (such as layering and vasculature) found in native human skin. If more complex synthetic skin could be created in the lab, it would have a breadth of applications including disease modelling, as well as testing for the toxicity and corrosivity of chemicals, transdermal drug delivery and cosmetic product testing."

"A novel discovery protocol for IoT based home automation Fog Computing; Network Protocol; Internet of Things It is proposed that Home Automation systems would be vastly improved by the novel approach of eliminating the Permanent Central Controller as it is the source of significant problems. This leaves the responsibilities of the Permanent Central Controller to be assumed by the remaining devices in the system, including IoT devices and interface devices such as smartphones and computers. While the capacity for joining devices to a network without the Permanent Central Controller has been considered, device discovery has not. This paper examines existing protocols but finds that while many have worthwhile aspects none are suitable for the task. A novel discovery protocol is proposed, using smartphones or computers as intermittent control devices. This new protocol is developed with the aid of a new Robust Network Development Methodology which is able to anticipate problematic use cases prior to implementation. This methodology was very successful in identifying and eliminating significant problems with the new protocol. Implementation and measurement of the novel discovery protocol demonstrates the viability and robustness of discovery without a Permanent Central Controller on low cost ESP8266 family devices."

"An Integrated Framework for Privacy-Preserving Based Anomaly Detection for Cyber-Physical Systems Attack; Supervisory Control; Intrusion Detection Protecting Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) is highly important for preserving sensitive information and detecting cyber threats. Developing a robust privacy-preserving anomaly detection method requires physical and network data about the systems, such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), for protecting original data and recognising cyber-attacks. In this paper, a new privacy-preserving anomaly detection framework, so-called PPAD-CPS, is proposed for protecting confidential information and discovering malicious observations in power systems and their network traffic. The framework involves two main modules. First, a data pre-processing module is suggested for filtering and transforming original data into a new format that achieves the target of privacy preservation. Second, an anomaly detection module is suggested using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Kalman Filter (KF) for precisely estimating the posterior probabilities of legitimate and anomalous events. The performance of the PPAD-CPS framework is assessed using two public datasets, namely the Power System and UNSW-NB15 dataset. The experimental results show that the framework is more effective than four recent techniques for obtaining high privacy levels. Moreover, the framework outperforms seven peer anomaly detection techniques in terms of detection rate, false positive rate, and computational time."
"A global case study on the relations between climate change and child labour in agriculture Eliminating child labour is a global priority embedded in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8.7,

"Whole of meat supply chain waste mapping and interventions – Phase 1 The project will quantify meat waste generation in Australian meat supply chains, identify the root causes
of waste generation, and propose solutions that can be adopted by industry. It will fill significant gaps in
data about the volumes and costs of meat waste, to inform the co-development of waste reduction
opportunities with industry and government partners. It is Phase 1 of a larger 3-phased project, focusing
on the upstream production stages (farm to retail door) for one meat product (beef). Subsequent phases
will expand into other meat types (lamb, pork, chicken) and the downstream consumption stages,
informed by another FFW CRC project “Consumer fridge behaviour and waste reduction of red meat”. The
benefits to the red meat industry from this Phase 1 project will be identification of large cost saving
opportunities for actors in the supply chain from meat waste solutions, a workforce more skilled in
resource efficiency, and increased collaboration and transparency along the supply chain to unlock
innovation. The benefits for society will be reductions in the environmental impacts of meat products
(particularly GHG emissions), helping maintain the meat industry’s social licence to operate and its longterm capacity for it to contribute to Australia’s economy.

"Computational fluid dynamics comparison of impaired breathing function in French bulldogs with nostril stenosis and an examination of the efficacy of rhinoplasty Tracheoscopy; Craniosynostoses; French Bulldog Background: Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) in dogs indicates a particular set of upper airway abnormalities found in brachycephalic dogs (e.g., French bulldogs). Stenotic nares is one of the primary BOAS-related abnormalities restricting the functional breathing of affected dogs. For severe stenosis, rhinoplasty is required to increase the accessibility of the external nostril to air; however, the specific improvement from surgery in terms of respiratory physiology and uptake of inhaled air has not been fully elucidated Method: This study employed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to evaluate the effects of different stenotic intensities on airflow patterns in a total of eight French bulldog upper airways. A bulldog with severe stenosis after surgery was included to examine the efficacy of the surgical intervention. Results: The results showed homogeneous airflow distributions in healthy and mild stenosis cases and significantly accelerated airstreams at the constricted positions in moderate and severe stenosis bulldogs. The airflow resistance was over 20-fold greater in severe stenosis cases than the healthy cases. After surgery, a decrease in airflow velocity was observed in the surgical region, and the percentage of reduced airflow resistance was approximately 4%. Conclusions: This study suggests impaired breathing function in brachycephalic dogs with moderate and severe stenosis. The results also serve as a reference for veterinarians in surgical planning and monitoring bulldogs' recuperation after surgery."

"Propagation of fully coherent and partially coherent complex scalar fields in aberration space Phase Contrast; Gratings; Radiography We consider the propagation of both fully coherent and partially coherent complex scalar fields, through linear shift-invariant imaging systems. The state of such imaging systems is characterized by a countable infinity of aberration coefficients, the values for which can be viewed as coordinates for an infinity of orthogonal axes that span the aberration space into which the output propagates. For fully coherent complex scalar disturbances, we study the propagation of the field through the imaging system, while for partially coherent disturbances it is the two-point correlation functions whose propagation we study. For both systems we write down generalized propagators in both real and Fourier space, differential equations for evolution through aberration space, transport equations, and Hamilton-Jacobi equations. A generalized form of the Wolf equations is a special case of our formalism."
"Stability, flow alignment and a phase transition of the lipidic cubic phase during continuous flow injection Glycerol Oleate; Liquid Crystals; Nanocrystal Continuous flow injection is a key technology for serial crystallography measurements of protein crystals suspended in the lipidic cubic phase (LCP). To date, there has been little discussion in the literature regarding the impact of the injection process itself on the structure of the lipidic phase. This is despite the fact that the phase of the injection matrix is critical for the flow properties of the stream and potentially for sample stability. Here we report small-angle X-ray scattering measurements of a monoolein:water mixture during continuous delivery using a high viscosity injector. We observe both an alignment and modification of the LCP as a direct result of the injection process. The orientation of the cubic lattice with respect to the beam was estimated based on the anisotropy of the diffraction pattern and does not correspond to a single low order zone axis. The solvent fraction was also observed to impact the stability of the cubic phase during injection. In addition, depending on the distance traveled by the lipid after exiting the needle, the phase is observed to transition from a pure diamond phase (Pn3m) to a mixture containing both gyriod (Ia3d) and lamellar (LÎ±) phases. Finite element modelling of the observed phase behaviour during injection indicates that the pressure exerted on the lipid stream during extrusion accounts for the variations in the phase composition of the monoolein:water mixture."

"Encapsulation in egg white protein nanoparticles protects anti-oxidant activity of curcumin Curcumin; Demethoxycurcumin; Nanocrystal This study investigated the encapsulation of curcumin into egg white protein (EWP) nanoparticles. Processing conditions used to formulate the nanoparticles, including pH and the addition of ethanol, were used to control the unfolding and aggregation behavior of EWP. The curcumin loading capacity of the EWP nanoparticles was found to be strongly linked to the structural transitions of the protein during heat denaturation, and the microscopic properties of the particles such as particle size and zeta-potential. Fibrous particles were formed at lower pH (3.0) and were associated with a higher curcumin loading than the granular particles formed at pH 3.8. Ethanol leads to an increase in Î²-sheet structure, and the formation of a coarser gel structure during heat denaturation, resulted in an increase in particle diameter. The highest curcumin loading capacities were 11.53 and 9.89 mg/g protein (with a final curcumin concentration of 312.5 Î¼M and 268 Î¼M respectively), at pH 3.0 and 3.8, respectively. Encapsulation in EWP nanoparticles was shown to both effectively slow the degradation ratio as well as protect the antioxidant activity of encapsulated curcumin."

"Interneuron development is disrupted in preterm brains with diffuse white matter injury: Observations in mouse and human Outcome; Prematurity; Encephalomalacia Preterm brain injury, occurring in approximately 30% of infants born <32 weeks gestational age, is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The mechanism of gray matter injury in preterm born children is unclear and likely to be multifactorial; however, inflammation, a high predictor of poor outcome in preterm infants, has been associated with disrupted interneuron maturation in a number of animal models. Interneurons are important for regulating normal brain development, and disruption in interneuron development, and the downstream effects of this, has been implicated in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we utilize postmortem tissue from human preterm cases with or without diffuse white matter injury (WMI; PMA range: 23+2 to 28+1 for non-WMI group, 26+6 to 30+0 for WMI group, p = 0.002) and a model of inflammation-induced preterm diffuse white matter injury (i.p. IL-1Î², b.d., 10 Î¼g/kg/injection in male CD1 mice from P1-5). Data from human preterm infants show deficits in interneuron numbers in the cortex and delayed growth of neuronal arbors at this early stage of development. In the mouse, significant reduction in the number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons was observed from postnatal day (P) 10. This decrease in parvalbumin neuron number was largely rectified by P40, though there was a significantly smaller number of parvalbumin positive cells associated with perineuronal nets in the upper cortical layers. Together, these data suggest that inflammation in the preterm brain may be a contributor to injury of specific interneuron in the cortical gray matter. This may represent a potential target for postnatal therapy to reduce the incidence and/or severity of neurodevelopmental disorders in preterm infants."
"Chemosensation in Ascaris infection (administered by University of Melbourne) During invasion, many parasitic helminths (worms) migrate through a number of host tissues and organs before reaching their final infection site. This process is essential and can be targeted for novel methods of parasite control. We have identified chemosensory activity during migration by the giant pig roundworm, Ascaris suum, during migration through the host liver and lung. We will use a combination of cutting-edge imaging, systems biology, chemical biology and microfluidic methods rooted in classical parasitology to explore Ascaris chemosensation during larval migration, identify the key host queues and parasite genes regulating this process, and probe helminth chemosensation as a novel target for anti-parasitic treatments."
"Acupuncture for recurrent urinary tract infection in women: a systematic review and meta-analysis Fosfomycin; Urinary Tract Infections; Anti-Bacterial Agents Background: Increasing antibiotic resistance has motivated interest in non-antibiotic prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI). Objectives: To conduct a systematic review of the current state of evidence of acupuncture for uncomplicated rUTI in women. Search strategy: Nine databases (PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, AMED, CBM, CNKI, CQVIP, Wanfang) were searched from inception to February 2019. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of acupuncture and related therapies for prophylaxis or treatment of uncomplicated rUTI in women were included. Data collection and analysis: Risk of bias was assessed, and the quality and strength of evidence evaluated using the GRADE framework. Results were reported as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results: Five RCTs involving 341 participants were included. Methodological quality of studies and strength of the evidence were low to moderate. The chance of achieving a composite cure with acupuncture therapies was greater than that with antibiotics (three studies, 170 participants, RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.31-2.81, I2 = 38%). The risk of UTI recurrence was lower with acupuncture than with no treatment (two studies, 135 participants, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26â€“0.58, I2 = 0%) and sham acupuncture (one study, 53 participants, RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22â€“0.92). Conclusions: Acupuncture appeared to be beneficial for treatment and prophylaxis of rUTIs, noting the limitations of the current evidence. Given the growing challenge of antibiotic resistance, there is a need for high-quality RCTs of non-pharmacological interventions such as acupuncture. Tweetable abstract: This review found that acupuncture may improve treatment and prevent recurrence of urinary tract infection in women."

"Wait time prediction for airport taxis using weighted nearest neighbor regression Taxis; Passengers; Lack In this paper, we address the neighborhood identification problem in the presence of a large number of heterogeneous contextual features. We formulate our research as a problem of queue wait time prediction for taxi drivers at airports and investigate heterogeneous factors related to time, weather, flight arrivals, and taxi trips. The neighborhood-based methods have been applied to this type of problem previously. However, the failure to capture the relevant heterogeneous contextual factors and their weights during the calculation of neighborhoods can make existing methods ineffective. Specifically, a driver intelligence-biased weighting scheme is introduced to estimate the importance of each contextual factor that utilizes taxi drivers' intelligent moves. We argue that the quality of the identified neighborhood is significantly improved by considering the relevant heterogeneous contextual factors, thus boosting the prediction performance (i.e., mean prediction error < 0.09 and median prediction error < 0.06). To support our claim, we generated an airport taxi wait time dataset for the John F. Kennedy International Airport by fusing three real-world contextual datasets, including taxi trip logs, passenger wait times, and weather conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that the presence of heterogeneous contextual features and the drivers' intelligence-biased weighting scheme significantly outperform the baseline approaches for predicting taxi driver queue wait times."

"Harnessing the power of the gut-brain axis; dietary manipulations as a therapy in a model of preterm infant brain injury The data from this project is envisaged to support our hypothesis that after an early life inflammatory challenge that recapitulates preterm infant brain damage, ongoing microbiome disturbances alter gastrointestinal structure and function alongside changes in brain structure and function. We also hypothesise that treatment of preterm born infants with the polysaccharide fucoidan will potentially improve the associated nervous system damage. Fucoidan is a complex polysaccharide found in many species of brown seaweed. Fucoidan has previously been shown in pre-clinical studies to restore the microbiome and decrease systemic inflammation when provided as a dietary supplement [1]. Fucoidan is safe to use in humans, being shown to decrease circulating levels of pro-inflammatory marker interleukin-6 and to decrease monocyte phagocytosis [2]. Fucoidan is detected in the blood of humans following ingestion [3]. The industry partner Marinova will provide Fucoidan (i.e. food grade standard seaweed extract) for this project. 

We will employ a well validated animal model of the inflammatory injury of the preterm born infant [4, 5].  In this model we will show the effects of perinatal injury on the gut microbiome, and myelin integrity using a novel, transportable non-invasive and translatable approach; subsurface Raman spectroscopy for investigating the biochemistry of brain tissue in situ, such as a signature for myelin integrity.  We will validate our novel Raman data with conventional immunohistological approaches.  In this model using these translatable techniques we will also test the neuro- and enteroprotective ability of dietary fucoidan. Gastrointestinal tissues will also be banked from animals in this project for future analysis following positive outcomes from this study."

"Navigating climate change risk: the role of management accountants in implementing the TCFD framework Please note re: contract: RMIT University agrees to the standard research contract, with the exception of changes to Clause 5.1(i) and the omission of Clause 6.5, as discussed with and confirmed by Jacky Pfennig, CIMA Research and Development Manager, 20 August 2020 (Vanessa from Contracts).

Significant challenges for companies are presented by the recommendations to disclose climate change related financial risks arising from the 2017 Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). There are several major obstacles faced by corporations in reporting climate change risk in alignment with TCFD recommendations which need to be addressed (O’Dwyer & Unerman, 2020). One such obstacle is the is tension between the traditional role of accounting and an increasing need to focus on longer term strategic issues such as climate change risk. The potential contribution that management accountants can make in overcoming such obstacles is significant, particularly when applying their combined knowledge of analytical accounting techniques and business acumen (Linnenluecke et al. 2015). The objective of this study is therefore to provide a better understanding of how management accountants can contribute to corporate responses to TCFD requirements. We aim to explore how management accountants can contribute to the development of appropriate climate-related scenarios and to better integrate this into organisational strategy. Such an understanding is timely and warranted as the pressure for quality disclosure of climate change risk and risk management strategies escalates. In-depth interviews of management accountants will be utilised as the main mode of data for this study."
"The effect of domestic laundry detergents on the light fastness of certain reactive dyes on 100% cotton Bleaching; Cotton Fabrics; Whiteness This study presents findings on the effect of several domestic laundry detergents on the fastness to light of selected fiber reactive dyes applied to cotton. Cotton fabric dyed with commonly used reactive dyes were laundered with water only, several domestic detergents, and a laboratory-formulated neutral detergent, and then exposed to light for 2 h in the wet state. Exposures were repeated 15 times, equivalent to 30 h of exposure. Color loss and color difference were measured after 5, 10, and 15 wash cycles, and 10 h, 20 h, and 30 h of exposure. When the fabric was exposed to light wet, the color faded more rapidly than when it was exposed dry. The presence of an oxidizing bleach (sodium perborate or sodium percarbonate) in the detergent increased color loss during washing and wet exposure to light. Ultraviolet radiation from the light source, heat, moisture, alkali, and oxidizing bleach during exposure resulted in hydrolysis of the dyeâ€“fiber bond, causing dye desorption during washing and rinsing. The combination of ultraviolet radiation and oxidizing bleaches altered the chemistry of the dye and hence its shade. This was particularly evident on the black dye and one of the navy blue dyes."

"Prediction of Cognitive Performance of Drivers using Eye Fixation Behaviours Elderly Driver; Automobile Driving; Traffic Behavior The relationship between features of an elderly driver's eye fixations and cognitive performance was analysed. The participants were 29 motorists aged over 60 years who drove frequently. Their eye movements were observed during 16 specific situations along a test course. Their cognitive performance was measured using computer based tests prior to driving. Since some features of eye fixations during driving correlate with the scores of cognitive tests, the possibility of predicting the cognitive scores was examined using features of eye fixations and a multiple regression analysis technique. Prediction performance was also affected by specific features of the fixations and their behaviour."

"Cost reduction and Deployment of Prefabricated Building Integrated Photovoltaics By 2050, world energy consumption is expected to increase more than 55%. Buildings remain a sector where efficiency improvement is critical to achieving the commitments of the Paris Agreement. Current approaches for the reduction of energy consumption in buildings are often predicated on the integration of bespoke renewable technologies into building projects. Among various renewable energy sources, solar energy is an attractive option in many countries with access to abundant solar resources.
Worldwide growth of photovoltaics has been fitting an exponential curve for more than two decades. Technology development, commercialization, and manufacturing scaling have contributed significantly to rapid reductions in solar hardware costs. However, the 'soft costs' of going solar including design, energy storage, financing, procurement, permitting, installation, labour, and inspection, have not declined as rapidly. The 'soft costs' make up more than half of the total cost of solar systems in buildings. The lack of economic confidence in the building sector makes the integration of prefabricated solar panels to building envelop difficult. 
This research aims to evaluate the mechanisms driving the cost reductions and deployment of prefabricated Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV). We will delve deeply into specific past technological innovations and policies, and prospectively asses BIPV's potential for future cost reduction."

"Predictors of Trauma Reactions in TV News Camera Operators Journalists; Emotion; Emotional Labour Previous research with general journalist samples has shown that journalists, in comparison to the general population, are at increased risk for trauma exposure and related psychological distress. Studies have seldom investigated more specific subgroups within the occupation. This study investigated current levels of work-related and personal exposure to potentially traumatic events and trauma reaction symptoms (posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and stress) in TV news camera operators (N = 117). It also investigated whether trauma exposure and neuroticism were related to increased levels of trauma reaction symptoms. An international sample of camera operators participated in an online survey. Regression analyses were conducted to investigate study topics. Camera operators reported high rates of work-related and personal trauma exposure. The sample experienced greater levels of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms than expected in the general population, whereas fewer differences were found regarding depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. More personal trauma exposure and neuroticism significantly predicted distress symptoms of all 4 kinds, whereas work-related exposure did not. Study limitations include the limited sample size and issues related to using surveys for measuring exposure to potentially traumatic events. The findings confirm what we know about the relationship between repeated exposure to aversive events and psychological distress. It contributes to the field by expanding this knowledge to include TV news camera operators, a unique role group within the journalism industry. It is also among the first to verify the positive association between neuroticism and trauma reactions in a journalist sample."

"Language Revitalisation: Building connections / storytelling a future Our proposal is centred on building capacity in collaboration with Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, educators and practitioners, a focus that needs much support at RMIT. This is achieved through a 3-part workshop series with teams of successful Indigenous/non-Indigenous collaborators, to learn from their open, collaborative frameworks and cross-disciplinary interaction, to generate opportunities for educational development, especially for non-Indigenous staff. The workshops build towards a 2-day symposium at RMIT, focused on shared storytelling and language, as an exemplar of successful Indigenous/non-Indigenous collaboration. We will document these examples and frameworks to become sharable resources through the RMIT website."
"Novel, Innovative modified tetanus toxin drugs for weak muscle conditions (administered by Snoretox Pty Ltd) RMIT has a long-standing collaboration with Snoretox, dating back to a joint ARC Linkage grant awarded in 2011. In collaboration with Snoretox, the team at RMIT have developed an innovative solution for lack of tone muscle disorders, based on tetanus toxin. These were extensively tested in mice, and shown to be very effective at inducing muscle contraction, even in mice vaccinated against tetanus toxin. The potential of such a product is enormous and will be applicable to many disease states in a similar way to the related botulinum toxin (albeit with the opposite activity).
The proposal is to develop a research plan, with all the documentation that entails. There will be targeted studies to identify potential targets for treatment, in particular starting with, but not limited to, motor neurone disease. Manufacturing and toxicology studies will be undertaken."

"Neutron scattering quantification of unfrozen pore water in frozen mud Frost Heave; Frozen Soils; Soil The Earth's polar regions are experiencing a greater frequency of freeze-thaw events throughout the polar summer, contributing to atmospheric methane and destabilising clay-rich sediments. Clays in soils tightly bind pore water and thus substantially modify freeze-thaw events. While temperatures of phase transitions for confined pore water may be precisely assessed using calorimetric or thermal analyses to âˆ’30 or âˆ’40 Â°C, neutron scattering directly probes how pores in clay minerals control ice formation and melting to lower temperatures. We apply elastic neutron scattering to accurately quantify the unfrozen water content of clay gels and unambiguously identify different pore-water environments by their freezing temperatures. Using this approach, we conclude that cryosuction controls water mobility in frozen soils in the absence of soluble salts to much lower temperatures than observed by other techniques. Dyanmics determined from neutron scattering indicates that water in clay gel pores thaws at much lower temperatures than currently considered, and thus pose potential risks for contaminant migration at sub freezing temperatures. The general poor strength of wet clays can significantly impact infrastructure in cold regions undergoing an increased frequency of freeze-thaw events."

"Honeycomb-like porous metallic glasses decorated by Cu nanoparticles formed by one-pot electrochemically galvanostatic etching Dealloying; Metallic Glasses; Copper Pitting corrosion is a common localized corrosion phenomenon, which can lead to cracks and mechanical failure in structural metal materials. On the contrary, pitting corrosion could be a beneficial tool for generating large-area porous structures, which holds a great premise in a number of functional services, such as catalysis, sensing, storage, imprint lithography, and membranes. Herein we presents an electrochemical approach for creating a large-area honeycomb-like porous structure in Zr-based metallic glasses. A pitting process followed by subsurface tunnel etching in NaCl solution elicits to characteristic micrometer scale channels and nanometer size amorphous sidewalls decorated by Cu nanoparticles on the metallic glass substrate. A root-shape growing mechanism of tunnels initiated from pits and penetrating into alloy matrix is postulated. In addition, the effect of alloy composition on the microstructure of honeycomb-like porous metallic glasses is also investigated in detail."
"Edges of home ownership (Administered by Curtin University) Housing pathways were traditionally viewed as linear progressions that began on leaving the parental home and ended in outright ownership.

The outcomes will promote policies that enhance financial wellbeing, housing stability and retirement income security amidst growing housing precariousness in Australia."
"Street performers and donations in an online environment in the wake of COVID-19 Cultural Economy; Freelancer; Art The spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) has meant that street performers can no longer perform on the street. This has changed the landscape for the exchange for money between a street performer and their audience. The paper uses a unique data set from the online busking platform â€˜The Busking Projectâ€™ (https://busk.co) to analyse whether sign up by performers to the platform and donation by individuals to street performers through the platform has changed since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The results show a lift both in street performers signing up to the platform and in individuals' donations to street performers after the announcement. The recovery of cities and the cultural economy from COVID-19 will not be immediate. As we move to a post COVID-19 world our results have implications for performers, for donors and for (local) governments as street performers return to the street."

"An online soil nitrogen content monitoring system using gas sensor technology Soil nitrogen content (SNC) is an important indicator which strongly correlates with the crop yield and greenhouse gas emissions. The effective monitoring of SNC can also minimise over-fertilization which is a ubiquitous problem in Australia and China. So far the measurements are mainly based on optical, radiometric and electrochemical platforms. However, these technologies are yet capable of applied widely in farmland due to their relatively high cost and non-continuous measurement nature. 
The correlation between nitrogen fertilizers and nitrous oxide gas emission provides a strong base to use low-cost gas sensor networks for monitoring SNC in a real-time and online manner. This project will involve the collaboration between RMIT University (Australia) and Intelirri Technology Co., Ltd., (China) to apply the patented nitrous oxide physisorption gas sensor technology (RMIT) into the smart wireless agriculture platform (Intelirri Technology) to develop the world?s first real-time and online SNC monitoring system. This project will align with the ?Food and agribusiness? priority area and expect to be last for two years. Researchers from RMIT will travel to Beijing to meet with delegates from Intelirri Technology for discussing the feasibility study and business plan. Intelirri Technology will not only provide their patented technologies but also the company-owned farms to assist the system development and evaluation.

"Human health risk assessment from accidental ingestion of garden soil: impact of bioaccessible Pb concentrations and soil characteristics on exposure assessment To determine quantitative relationships between bioaccessibility and common soil characteristics in
soils from the north and west of Melbourne, Victoria.
Specifically:
a) to determine to what extent the soil particle size affects the relationship between Pb
bioaccessibility and soil characteristics;
b) to develop models that describe bioaccessible soil Pb concentrations with respect to soil
characteristics (pH, SOM, CEC, EC, and total Pb, Fe and P concentrations)
With the aim of determing if standard soil characteristics can be used to model biaoccessibility in
Pb contaminated soil and thus used to gain an idea of likely Pb bioaccessibility in soil. The outcome
is potentially a faster and efficient indication of bioaccessibility that could reduce expenditure

"Evaluating the effectiveness of increased landholder engagement for effective biodiversity management and reduced psychological distance of climate change Managing biodiversity on private land is an important part of maintaining landscape integrity and
resilience in the face of climate change (Harris et al. 2006). While the resilience of social?ecological
systems can be increased through biodiversity management (e.g. invasive species reduction,
conservation burning, reduced grazing), the influences of climate change may require alterations to
current management practices to ensure that management remains effective (Rissman et al. 2015).
Conservation covenantors represent a motivated group of landholders who are engaged in private land
conservation (PLC) and management (Selinske et al. 2015), however their management effectiveness is
put at risk by the effects of climate change. This in turn poses a risk to their conservation values, with
research having shown that covenantor satisfaction is influenced by their ability to manage their land
effectively and preserve the landscape in perpetuity (Selinske et al. in review). Satisfaction may also be
enhanced through the engagement of covenantors with a stewardship officer (Selinske et al. in review)."

"Efficient Pipeline Transport of Highly Concentrated Wastewater Sludge This project aims to investigate the rheology and fluid mechanics of highly concentrated wastewater sludges and develop tools to support effective pipeline designs for wastewater treatment plants. The project expects to generate new knowledge about the complex flow of concentrated wastewater which will enable predictive models to support the design and optimization of pipeline transport systems. Expected outcomes of the project include a new toolkit that will enable wastewater treatment plants to design and optimize both existing and future pipeline systems. This will support the Australian wastewater industry to plan for future growth, increase throughput and
efficiency, reduce environmental pollutants, and capital and operating costs.
Wastewater treatment plants have identified a growing need to transport highly concentrated wastewater due to population growth and stringent environmental regulations. Current pipeline design methods are not suitable for concentrated sludge, leading to energy losses and potential pump failure. This project will develop validated, accurate and predictive models of concentrated sludge flow and a pipeline design and optimisation toolkit. Research outcomes will be incorporated into the partner organisations’ operations and disseminated to the

"City of Parramatta Urban Tree Canopy Study, 2020/21 The development and selection of methodologies to interface with planning systems represents an ongoing research challenge. To achieve the objectives above, especially point 3 above, the team will employ and adapt existing methodologies (i-Tree, Geographically Weighted Regression) for identifying areas that can be planted. The outcome will enable the City of Parramatta to better target its planting efforts to reach its projected 40% canopy target by 2050.

This study of tree canopy directly draws and builds upon the team's (Amati/Hurley/Sun/Deilami) ongoing research expertise in the field of urban planning, specifically through the relationship between planning context and capacity and the potential for increasing canopy cover and urban green spaces. The findings from this study will contribute to the team's research publications."
"The Influence of historical scripts on contemporary calligraphy and type design Qing Dynasty; China; Emperor Traditionally, calligraphers and palaeographers seldom co-operate or collaborate. This is somewhat surprising considering both disciplines deal with the written texts in one form or another. One could argue that if we learn from each other's respective fields, it would be mutually beneficial and enrich each other's practice. This paper discusses the relationship between calligraphy, palaeography, and type design. It focuses on the question of how a calligrapher might approach and analyse a manuscript and how historical scripts have been an inspirational area for contemporary calligraphy and type design. This paper is written from a practitioner's perspective in describing the processes of how calligraphy is analysed. From looking at manuscripts and documents, what elements can be obtained to develop ideas into design and artwork? What are the processes involved in using both traditional and digital methods? In contemporary calligraphy, what cross-cultural elements can we learn to enrich our traditions? This paper will use examples of my work and that of others as models for discussion."

"Development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting Campylobacter hepaticus specific antibodies in chicken sera–a key tool in Spotty Liver Disease screening and vaccine development Campylobacter; Defeathering; Animals Spotty Liver Disease (SLD) is an emerging disease of serious concern in the egg production industry, as it causes significant egg loss and mortality in layer hens. The causative agent is a newly identified Gram-negative bacterium, Campylobacter hepaticus, and knowledge about C. hepaticus pathogenesis and the potential for vaccine development is still in its infancy. Current detection methods for SLD, such as PCR and culturing, only detect an active infection and will not give any indication of a past infection from which the bacteria have been cleared. An immunological assay, on the other hand, can provide information on previous infections and therefore is crucial in vaccine development against SLD. In the present study, we have developed the first immunoassay capable of detecting C. hepaticus-specific antibodies present in the sera of infected birds. The assay uses C. hepaticus total protein extract (TPE) as the antigen coating on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. The cross reactivity of C. hepaticus antibodies with closely related C. jejuni and C. coli antigens was successfully overcome by pre-absorbing the sera using C. jejuni cell extracts. The assay was validated using sera samples from both naturally- and experimentally-infected birds, birds vaccinated with formalin-killed bacteria, and serum samples from SLD-negative birds (control group). The optimized ELISA assay had 95.5% specificity and 97.6% sensitivity. The immunoassay provides a useful tool for monitoring the exposure of poultry flocks to C. hepaticus infection and can be used to direct and support vaccine development. HIGHLIGHTS The first immunoassay developed for Spotty Liver Disease (SLD). A useful method for detecting C. hepaticus-specific antibodies in birds. Highly specific (95.5%) and sensitive (97.6%) assay. A key tool for use in epidemiological studies and vaccine development."

"Open Innovation ? Research Translation and Applied Knowledge Exchange in Practice through University-Industry-Cooperation (OpenInnoTrain) The overarching objective of OPEN-INNO-Train is to form an international and inter-sectoral network of organisations
collaboratively working on the joint research field of Open Innovation, University-Industry Cooperation and Research
Translation. To facilitate Knowledge Development and Sharing in four contemporary areas - FinTech, Industry 4.0,
CleanTech, FoodTech. For globally interconnected societies, scientific research has the potential to foster yet unrealised economic growth, competitiveness, and wellbeing. The conversion of research outputs into tangible outcomes, and, ultimately, sustainable
impact is critically important and needs optimising. The process of converting research findings into economic and social benefits appears increasingly complex at a time when researchers often work in multidisciplinary teams, in a context of Open Innovation when cooperating with industry and other stakeholders. Illuminating it from the perspective of Research Translation, an approach increasingly gaining traction in the specific setting of University-Industry Collaboration, OPEN-INNO-TRAIN aims at opening the black box of knowledge conversion processes to generate and apply new insights from those four industry areas. Furthermore, OPEN-INNO-TRAIN
encapsulates the development of robust Research Translation tools capable of facilitating the translation process of
multidisciplinary research findings for the generation of impact. Combining scientific excellence from European and
international universities, Research and Technology Organisations with hands on expertise from pioneering companies,
OPEN-INNO-TRAIN will spearhead this sustainable venture using digital innovation hubs, co-tutelle, industrial PhDs, PPPs
and training measures to encourage international cooperation among researchers and industry practitioners across
disciplines whose final aim is to holistically foster, enhance and sustain over time the application of good research translation
practices."
Targeting oxidant-dependent pathways to improve stroke outcomes in COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major incurable global health burden and is the 4th largest cause of death worldwide. Patients with COPD are at increased risk for stroke and this is even higher in the weeks following a lung viral infection. The reason for this is unknown so the aim of this study is to determine why people with COPD are at increased risk for stroke and then develop novel treatments to prevent or reduce stroke in COPD patients.

"Examining the use of local government rate rebates for encouraging conservation in rapidly developing peri-urban areas The natural heritage values of peri-urban areas are under increasing threat from urban encroachment and development. Some private landholders elect to protect natural values on their land by entering into voluntary permanent protection agreements (covenants) with land trusts and government agencies, foregoing their rights to development and helping to retain the natural values of peri-urban areas. Preliminary discussions with industry (land trusts) and landholders have indicated that some local governments are highly supportive of these agreements, providing rebates and discounts on council rates for participating landholders, as a reward for their conservation commitment and an incentive for other landholders to sign up to a conservation covenant. Yet, other councils provide little or no support in terms of rate rebates. Why this discrepancy exists is currently unclear. "
"Estimation of Bearing Capacity of Piles in Cohesionless Soil Using Optimised Machine Learning Approaches Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines; Cone Penetration Test; Artificial Neural Network Accurate estimation of the bearing capacity of piles requires complex modelling techniques which are not justified by timeframe, budget, or scope of the projects. In this study, six advanced machine learning algorithms including decision tree, k-nearest neighbour, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, random forest, support vector regressor and extremely gradient boosting are employed to model the bearing capacity of piles in cohesionless soil, and the particle swarm optimisation algorithm is used to optimate the hyper-parameters of machine learning algorithms. A dataset comprising of 59 cases is employed and the R-squared value, root mean square error and variance accounted for are used as performance metrics to compare the performance of optimised machine learning methods. The comparison reveals that the optimised machine learning methods have great potential to estimate bearing capacity of piles and the particle swarm optimisation algorithm is efficient in the hyper-parameter tuning. The results show that R-squared values of six optimised machine learning approaches on the testing set vary from 0.731 to 0.9615. Also, the optimised extremely gradient boosting (R-squared value = 0.9615) shows the best performance compared with other algorithms. Furthermore, the relative importance of influential variable is investigated, which shows that effective stress is the most influential variable for bearing capacity of piles with an importance score of 30.9%. In addition, the results by the optimised machine learning method are compared to the Î²-method which is a popular empirical method. It is revealed the prominent performance of optimised machine learning approaches."
"How to target monocyte/macrophage reservoirs as part of a functional cure for HIV A functional cure for HIV infection aims to allow HIV+ people to stop antiretroviral therapy and live healthily in remission. Persistent infection of blood monocytes and their tissue partners, macrophages, causes chronic inflammation and is a barrier to achieving a functional cure. We will develop accurate ways to measure levels of HIV infection, and immunological approaches to reducing infection, in these cells to reduce inflammatory co-morbidities and help achieve remission."
"Cloud-based Disaster Relief Coordination and Optimisation Platform: A Proof of
Concept for Vietnam and Beyond The proposed Proof of Concept (PoC) is of paramount importance given the case of recent voluntary disaster relief operations in the central provinces of Vietnam which were severely affected by several back-to-back floods in early October of 2020. During this operation, there have been various problems widely reported on social media which can be synthesised into (1) too many relief delegations in some affected areas, while too few in the others; (2) too many relief delegations arriving at an affected area at the same time; (3) too many relief necessities which have already been provided at an affected area, while there is a shortage at other areas; and (4) uneven distribution of relief necessities among different groups of affected people. It is envisaged that a lack of up-to-date information, unharmonised coordination among stakeholders involved in the relief operations, and the absence or weak capability in resources optimisation, all contributed to the aforesaid problems. This project, therefore, aims to address the aforesaid problems through the application of
information and computing sciences in disaster relief. Specifically, the PoC of a Cloud-based Disaster Relief Coordination and Optimisation Platform shall be designed and prototyped to (1) enhance the harmonised coordination among various stakeholders in disaster relief operations through centrally processed information and data, and (2) optimise the outcomes of such operations via computing algorithms.

"Generalised superposition models for rheologically complex starch-nanohybrid films and integrational construction of master-curves Creep Tests; Creep; Viscoelastic We propose an integrational method to construct master-curves, using synthetic simultaneous multifrequency scans to avoid intrinsic temperature control variances and better predict Tg and Tm. Proposed generalised timeâ€“temperature superposition models for rheologically complex materials are presented. The methodologies and models were applied to thermoplastic starch films modified with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POS). We confirmed their thermorheologically complex behaviour, which in principle cannot be used to construct master curves. However, based on properties predicted by the models, we were able to establish temperature constraints where the time-temperature principle was valid. Our models have higher coefficient of determination than the Williamsâ€“Landelâ€“Ferry (WLF) or Arrhenius models currently applied in rheologically simple materials. The addition of POS increased the internal ordering of the films, leading to more compact molecular arrangement, made the films more resilient to deformation and their master-curves begin at higher frequencies than the control."
