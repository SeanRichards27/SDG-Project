"Failing to live up to the promise: the politics of equal pay in ‘new’ workplace and industrial relations institutions Political Representation; Quotas; Parliament Workplace and industrial relations regulations are key sites for policy intervention to address Australia's gender pay gap, which, at 15.3 per cent, is almost as large as it was in 1997. In both the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) and the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 (Cth) the goal of equal pay has a more central place than it did in predecessor legislation. In particular, the Fair Work Act has the potential to deliver more gender-equitable wage structures through addressing systemic gender-based undervaluation at the industry level. Adopting a feminist institutional approach this article examines equal pay policy in the operations of workplace and industrial relations regulation to ask why, despite some recent successes, this potential appears unlikely to be realised."
"The role of supply chain orientation in achieving supply chain sustainability Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices Supply chain orientation (SCO) has the potential to contribute to supply chain sustainability performance. The literature, however, has not determined whether SCO has a direct effect on supply chain sustainability performance, nor has it differentiated between the effects of different categories of SCO on supply chain sustainability performance. A SEM analysis of data collected from supply chain managers determined that the SCO construct of supply chain collaboration and communication could directly affect both supply chain environmental and social sustainability performance. The SCO construct of internal supply chain coordination, however, affected only supply chain environmental sustainability performance and this effect was mediated by the organisation's internal supply chain sustainability practices. A second path between supply chain collaboration and communication and supply chain environmental sustainability performance, which was mediated by internal supply chain sustainability practices was also identified. These findings indicate that different SCO constructs have different effect pathways in relation to supply chain sustainability performance. The identification of the effects of different categories of SCO and the SCO â€“ performance relationship has important implications for SCO research design."
"Numerical assessment of respiratory airway exposure risks to diesel exhaust particles Aerosol; Dry Powder Inhalers; Particle Transport Exposure to ambient air pollution presents great adverse health risks to respiratory health, and assessing the respiratory exposure doses, especially in the human deep lung regions, remains difficult due to the sheer complexity of the process. To bridge this gap, an extended large-to-small conducting lung airway model was adopted in this study, which includes a broad scope containing bronchial airways up to the 15th generation. Accumulation mode particles in the size range of 100 nm to 3.0 Î¼m representing major size spectrum of coarse diesel exhaust were released at the inlet of respiratory airway model, and both airflow and particle deposition characteristics were numerically investigated. The simulation results showed that the particle deposition in the respiratory airway is sensitive to the variation of inhalation flow rates. For inhalation exposure at lower breathing rate of 18 L/min, both deposited diffusive and inertia particles were very unevenly distributed in the lower respiratory airway. For inhalation exposure at higher breathing rate of 50 L/min, deposited diffusive and inertia particles were both scattered over the lower respiratory airway. In addition, high inhalation flow rate enabled inertia particles to be deposited further d ownstream of the airway with deposition hot spots observed in distal airways."
"Perspectives of scholars on the origin, spread and consequences of COVID-19 are diverse but not polarized One Health Initiative; Zoonosis; Communicable Diseases The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has devastated every sphere of human society. Governments around the world implemented unprecedented policies designed to slow the spread of the disease and assistance to cope with its impacts. Such policies, however, are short-term and debates have ensued about what broader policies are needed in the post-COVID-19 era to ensure societies are better prepared for future pandemics. Public opinion concerning COVID-19 and the post-COVID-19 era is diverse, and the patterns in opinion are not well documented. Here we synthesized the opinions of 3731 research scholars throughout the world based on a survey. The highest consensus among respondents concerned the need for improving public health infrastructure and delivering economic support, whereas agreement concerning ecological aspects was low. The survey revealed three dimensions of thinking about COVID-19. The first dimension relates to public health and has widespread support. The second dimension relates to science-led policy development focusing on social justice and environmental governance, covering components of both ecology and economy. The third dimension covers the role of nature conservation in reducing the risk of pandemics. Although opinions differed with age, country of citizenship, and level of education, there is strong agreement on the need for global health equity and science-led public policy."
"Achieving the SDGs: Evaluating indicators to be used to benchmark and monitor progress towards creating healthy and sustainable cities Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians In 2016, the World Health Organization declared that â€˜Health is one of the most effective markers of any city's successful sustainable developmentâ€™ (World Health Organisation, 2016). With estimates that around 6.7 billion people will live in cities by 2050, 21st century city planning decisions will play a critical role in achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They will determine the city structure and access to health-enhancing (or health-damaging) urban environments, and ultimately lifestyle choices that impact both individual and planetary health. Benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating city planning policies and interventions is therefore critical to optimise urban outcomes. In 2017, the UN adopted a global SDG indicator framework, calling for complementary national and regional indicators to be collected by member countries. UN Habitat has also developed an indicator action framework specifically for cities. This paper examined the extent to which the UN indicators will help cities evaluate their efforts to deliver sustainability and health outcomes. It identified inconsistencies between the two UN indicator frameworks. Many of the SDG indicators assess outcomes, rather than the comprehensive and integrated â€˜upstreamâ€™ policies and interventions required to deliver outcomes on-the-ground. Conversely, the UN Habitat framework incorporates intervention indicators, but excludes health outcome indicators. A more comprehensive approach to benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating policies designed to achieve healthy and sustainable cities and assessing spatial inequities is proposed."
"Earnings management and bank risk-taking behavior in Asia-Pacific region Loan Loss Provisions; Fair Value; International Financial Reporting Standards The issue of bank risk-taking behavior has regained attention in Asia-Pacific banking sector as banks in this region are facing rising risk and capital costs. This study investigates the association between earnings management and risk-taking behavior in Asia-Pacific banks. We argue that earnings management induces banks to invest in riskier assets to â€˜search for yieldâ€™ since earnings management increases banksâ€™ capital cost leading to reduction in profitability. Using a sample of 237 listed commercial banks across 13 Asia-Pacific countries and territories in the period of 2001â€“2017, our research finds that there is a significant positive relationship between earnings management using loan loss provisions and bank risk-taking behavior."
"Energy efficiency education and training: Australian lessons on what employers want—or need Personnel; Career Barriers; Employed Women This paper explores current approaches and future directions for energy efficiency education and training in the tertiary sector. Energy efficiency is a significant element in many jobs across the economy, with potential for substantial growth. It crosses disciplinary boundaries, as the range of skills and knowledge required by practitioners is broad, reflecting the diversity and expanding range of work roles that require energy efficiency skills and knowledge. Limitations of education and training contribute to a situation where business and consumer decision-making often involves little or no consideration of energy, so outcomes are often sub-optimal. This increases costs, environmental and social impacts and undermines productivity improvement. As the significance of energy efficiency skills and knowledge in workplaces increases, more flexible and varied education and training models are needed to allow workers to upskill, gain new skills and integrate energy efficiency into business models. The paper discusses the barriers to adoption of more comprehensive energy efficiency content in programs and presents options for inclusion. The paper concludes that, in order to capture the potential of energy efficiency to contribute to a productive, sustainable economy, appropriate teaching resources and certification must be developed and introduced across most disciplines, while employers and recruitment consultants must be informed of the benefits, so they value energy efficiency skills and qualifications."
"Selective electron beam manufactured Ti-6Al-4V lattice structures for orthopedic implant applications: Current status and outstanding challenges Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V lattices display unique mechanical and biological properties by virtue of their engineered structure. These attributes enable the innovative design of patient-specific medical implants that (i) are conformal to the intended surgical geometry, (ii) mimic the mechanical properties of natural bone, and (iii) provide superior biological interaction to traditional implants. Selective electron beam melting (SEBM) is an established metal additive manufacturing (AM) process that has enabled the design and fabrication of a variety of novel intricate lattices for implant applications over the last 15 years. This article reviews the technical and clinical characteristics of SEBM Ti-6Al-4V lattices, including (i) the SEBM process and its capabilities, (ii) the structures of human bones with an exhaustive list of corresponding mechanical properties from literature, (iii) the mechanical properties of SEBM Ti-6Al-4V lattices of various designs and their shortcomings when compared to human bones, (iv) microstructural control of SEBM Ti-6Al-4V lattices for improved performance, (v) the lattice manufacturability and associated geometric errors, and (vi) clinical cases. Existing literature on the mechanical response of SEBM Ti-6Al-4V lattice structures is exhaustively evaluated for documentation quality using established theoretical models. This extensive data-set allows novel insights into the effect of lattice design on mechanical response that is not possible with the individual data; and provides a comprehensive database for those who are actively involved in patient-specific SEBM implant design. On this basis, outstanding challenges and research opportunities for SEBM Ti-6Al-4V lattices in the biomedical domain are identified and discussed."
"Human rights from a social accounting perspective in a post-conflict environment: The case of Sri Lanka Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative This paper examines how three decades of civil conflict in Sri Lanka has impacted the perceptions of the accounting practitioners with regard to human rights (both during and post-conflict). Using the legitimacy lens in social accounting and the role of the state-supported accountancy body-Institute of Chartered Accountants Sr Lanka (CASL) human rights case is investigated. Specifically, the studyâ€™s scope is on rights and the degree of legitimacy formation for which accounting associations are accountable for human rights disclosure in a post-conflict environment in an emerging economy. The study interprets documentary evidence and a survey data that was administered among the members of the CASL. The findings reveal that the civil conflict had not hindered the accountants being in parallel with the legitimacy of social accounting notions adopted by the Western world in the disclosure of human rights. At the individual response level, they perceive that the accounting discipline as agents to promote human rights disclosure in business entities. Despite the fact, that this study has a low response rate, what is generalisable is an understanding of the processes and mechanisms which relate to the way the accountants perceived human rights by themselves. The practical implication indicates that urgent measures need to be undertaken to mainstream the legitimate human rights obligations of business entities since there is no one-size-fits-all strategy in a post-conflict environment. The social implication is that awareness of human rights issues, especially among the next generation of accountants is vital since this transformation would enable them not only to be technically competent but also to be ethical in a post-conflict environment. The study contributes to the literature on perceptions of human rights in a post-conflict environment from a social accounting perspective in an emerging economy."
"Life cycle assessment of alkali-activated concretes under marine exposure in an Australian context Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali Alkali-activated concretes have been shown to be an environmentally advantageous construction material as they utilize waste or by-products as precursors, such as fly ash and ground blast furnace slag. These concretes also have the ability to achieve strengths suitable for structural applications. However, each mix design of an alkali-activated concretes is unique and requires a detailed life cycle analysis to determine the environmental impact and cost viability. This study evaluates the feasibility of alkali-activated fly ash or fly ash geopolymer and alkali-activated slag concrete developed for application in Australia currently subject to long term site performance studies. This paper reports a detailed life cycle assessment analysis of these concretes to assess their environmental footprint. The paper considers three distinct allocation methods: baseline, mass, and economic allocation, with two system boundaries: manufacture and construction. The study shows AAS concrete has a lower environmental impact than an equivalent strength PC concrete in two impact categories, global warming potential and eutrophication, while acidification and human toxicity depend on the allocation method applied in the manufacturing stage. The global warming potential (100-years) of AAS is 5.25â€“35% less than PC concrete. The FAGP concrete has more negative impacts on the environment than PC-based concrete, regardless of which allocation method is applied. The report highlights alkaline activators and transportation of raw materials as the main environmental impact contributors to concrete manufacture. The global warming potential of FAGP is 22â€“34% higher than the equivalent PC concrete in the baseline method. For the construction stage boundary, machinery appliances for handling concrete and transportation only contributes a small environmental impact (<4%) compared with concrete manufacturing. Cost estimation for concrete production suggests that the cost of the alkali-activated concrete is competitive with the conventional concrete market, dependant on the proximity of the feedstocks and the cost of sodium silicate. Neglecting the transportation cost of feedstocks, the cost of AAS concrete can be 4.8% cheaper, whereas the cost of FAGP concrete is 2.7% more expensive than PC concrete."
"Flood risk assessment of metro systems in a subsiding environment using the interval FAHP-FCA approach China; Dewatering; Confined Aquifer Metro systems are vulnerable to flooding during rainstorms and this situation worsens when a subsiding environment prevails. This study adopts the interval fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) incorporated with fuzzy clustering analysis (FCA) to assess the flood risk of metro systems in subsiding environments, considering both the regional subsidence of the ground and the longitudinal settlement along metro lines as assessment factors. Shanghai metro system is analysed as an example by using the proposed method (the FAHPâ€“FCA approach) together with the geographical information system (GIS). The assessment results show that more than 30% of metro lines in Shanghai are at a high risk of flooding, and the high-risk regions of metro lines are located in urban centres. The ratio of high-risk regions identified by the FAHPâ€“FCA approach exceeds that obtained using the existing FAHP approach, which indicates that the FCA-FAHP approach can capture high-risk metro systems in Shanghai. Moreover, the comparison also shows that subsiding environments exacerbate the flood risk of metro systems. It is proposed that, to mitigate the risk of flooding, subsidence environments should be considered in more detail."
"The Effect of Market Isolation on Competitive Behavior in Retail Petrol Markets Price Dynamics; Price Dispersion; Asymmetric Pricing Regarding the importance of energy for societies, this study examines the characteristics of the petrol price cycle in Perth, Australia. Given the micro-and macro-economic changes, the studyâ€™s purpose was to determine whether the Edgeworth features of the cycle are robust and resilient to market changes. The contribution is to extend previous studies, evaluate Edgeworthâ€™s consistency, and capture several episodes of economic activity that have been unexplored. The findings showed a frequent and asymmetric weekly cycle that is characterized by decreasing prices over six consecutive days, followed by a large price jump in one day. The average price rise in the relenting phase for major stations was 14.10 cents per liter (CPL) and 13.14 CPL for independents. For the major and independents, the daily average price drops in the undercutting phase were 2.25 and 1.92 CPL, respectively. Despite the market changes, Edgeworthâ€™s cycle characteristics, cycle duration, and the stationsâ€™ role have remained stable during the last 15 years, but peak and trough days have changed. The study is crucial as it provides insights into the robustness of price cycles and competition during significant downturns and prolonged periods of growth. This analysis is critical from a regulatory, policy, and consumer welfare perspective. Furthermore, this paper investigates future petrol consumption in light of renewable energy developments."
"Leveraging endogenous climate resilience: urban adaptation in Pacific Small Island Developing States Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Pacific Small Island Developing States are often referred to as the â€œfrontlineâ€ of climate change, facing an array of worsening climate-related shocks and stressors. However, despite their underlying exposure to climate change impacts, the role of Pacific Island cities as both an avenue for adaptation and sites of climate vulnerability is often overlooked. This paper reflects on two ongoing participatory action research projects conducted by UN-Habitat and research partners from Australian universities in Honiara, Solomon Islands, and Port Vila, Vanuatu. Findings from community consultations across 16 communities in these settings demonstrate the critical role of endogenous modes of resilience, as well as the strong correlation between these spaces and sub-city climate vulnerability. Cross-scale integration with climate resilience planning processes is then used to examine points of conflict between stakeholder interpretations of core functions within socioecological systems, demonstrating the importance of considering values and conflict within urban climate adaptation."
"Supply chain communication and cultural compatibility: performance implications in the global manufacturing industry Business Performance; Manufacturing Strategy; Competitive Priorities Purpose: Research has extensively focused on the cultural differences in supply chain collaboration while neglecting the importance of cultural similarities and compatible goals among supply chain members. With the rise of global supply chain network, the choice of supply chain orientation is critical. This study argues that performance differences between these configurations highlight managerial implications for sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing from uncertainty reduction and cognitive social capital theories, this study developed a taxonomy of manufacturing firms based on process alignment between cultural compatibility and supply chain communication. The empirical data used in this study were drawn from the Global Manufacturing Research Group (GMRG) survey project, with data collected from 680 manufacturing companies, across various industry sectors and countries. Findings: There appeared to be consistent three major configurations: the Proactive, the Initiative and the Reactive. Manufacturers distanced themselves based mainly on communication with customers on events and proprietary information. Communication-cultural compatibility taxonomies influence differently on operations and financial performance. The Initiative, who excelled in communication practices gained significant improvement in efficiency and delivery measures. While Reactive lagged, Proactive aligned in both capabilities to experience higher payoffs in operational and financial measures. The findings offer a step-by-step approach where manufacturers intensify communication with partners for better efficiency and delivery measures, then align cultural practices to obtain financial, quality and innovation performance. Research limitations/implications: It will be fruitful for future research to examine the evolution of longitudinally. A comparison between developed and developing economies will be of interest. Practical implications: The findings provide a step-by-step decision-making process for supply chain communication and offer guidance especially for global supply chain managers. Originality/value: This study adds greater comprehensiveness and richness to the information exchange literature on performance by process aligning to enhance cultural compatibility."
"A spatial and temporal analysis of forest dynamics using Landsat time-series Landsat; Land Cover; Remote Sensing Understanding forest dynamics at the landscape scale is critical given the demands of sustainable forest management and climate change mitigation. This study proposes an approach for holistically characterising and analysing forest dynamics across large areas and long-time periods using information derived from Landsat time-series. To achieve this, we first developed a two-phase classification process to predictively map (1) disturbance and recovery levels and (2) disturbance causal agents for multiple detected disturbance events. The model explanatory data included a range of trajectory-based metrics derived from Landsat time-series, while model training and validation data were derived from a human-interpreted reference dataset. While previous studies have often described forest dynamics using some specific spectral change metrics, we demonstrated an ensemble approach to map disturbance and recovery trends (by treating them as a single metric) and to characterise not only abruptly occurring change events (e.g., clear-fell logging and wildfire) but also events of low severity (e.g., prescribed burning and selective logging). In addition, we adopted a space-time data cube concept to simultaneously report both newly detected disturbance events (detected disturbances) as well as events that have previously occurred but are ongoing (ongoing disturbances). This ongoing element of forest dynamics is often under-reported. The method was tested over 3.7 million ha of public land sclerophyll forests, where multiple disturbance events have occurred over the last 30 years (1987â€“2016). Our models of disturbance and recovery levels obtained overall accuracies of 78.6% and 72.3% for primary and secondary disturbance events, respectively. The overall accuracies for the models of disturbance causal agents were 80.7% and 73.0%, respectively. The data cube reported an average annual disturbance rate of 4.2% per year. This was dominated by newly detected disturbance (2.7% per year) as distinct from ongoing disturbance that was, however, considerable (1.5% per year). Our approach presented herein can improve the understanding of forest dynamics over long time periods and large areas and has potential for supporting land managers."
"Dwelling justice: locating settler relations in research and activism on stolen land Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness There is a general consensus now in Australia that we are in the grip of a severe housing crisis. The characteristics of spiralling housing costs and deepening precarity are unfolding in a context of the systematic managed decline of public housing as a critical social infrastructure, such that the capacity to make and find â€˜homeâ€™ is thinning every day. Yet in a settler-colony, such as Australia, the struggle against housing injustice is set inside an already violent relationship of un-homing that creates the very conditions for others to make home. Reckoning with this monstrous dilemma, of the politics of dwelling justice on stolen land, is the focus of this essay, which springs from our own experience and failure to fully comprehend the ways that our housing research and activism works to reinforce settler colonial logics of dwelling on stolen land."
"At home in the city: Educated women, housing and belonging in port moresby Papua New Guinea; Pacific Islands; Melanesia Historically, Papua NewGuineans of diverse ethnic origins have been seen as belonging in and to their villages, rather than urban areas. Postcolonial administrators constructed urban migrants as temporary and threatening and represented their 'rightful place' as the village. Within this schema, women in particular have been construed as 'matter out of place'. Consequently, if Papua New Guinean men's presence in urban areas was meant to be temporary and contained, Papua New Guinean women were not supposed to be there at all. In this chapter, I challenge the view of Port Moresby, the capital city of Papua New Guinea as a place that is only and always dangerous for women. To do so, I explore how three women are constructing home in thismaligned city.Demonstrating the complexities and contradictions of this denigrated town, I challenge the singularly derogatory themes evident in local and international representations of PortMoresby and affirm the importance of exploring and representing this place from a variety of perspectives. The chapter is situated within a developing body of work that reflects the increasing ethnographic interest in Melanesian urbanity and informed by feminist theories about the relationship between bodies and places."
"Preparation of a Novel Carbon Dot/Polyvinyl Alcohol Composite Film and Its Application in Food Preservation Fluorescence; Nanodots; Carbon Nanoparticles Carbon dots (CDs) were synthesized with the facile hydrothermal method to produce CDs/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) active food packaging films. The CDs had a diameter ranging from 2.01 to 5.61 nm and were well-dispersed. The effects of different concentrations of CDs on mechanical strength, water resistance, morphology, optical, and thermal performance of the CDs/PVA films were discussed. The incorporation of CDs in the PVA film improved its mechanical properties, water resistance properties, UV blocking properties, and thermal stability and endowed the composite film with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The maximum scavenging rates of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and ABTS free radicals by the 0.50% CDs/PVA film were 72.81 and 97.08%, respectively. The inhibition zone diameters of the 0.50% CDs/PVA solution against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were 9.52, 8.21, and 9.05 mm, respectively. Using the 0.50% CDs/PVA film as active packaging, the shelf life of banana, jujube, and fried meatballs was observed to be extended significantly. These results demonstrate the viability of the CDs/PVA composite film as a promising active food packaging material."
"Ultrasensitive Label-Free Nucleic-Acid Biosensors Based on Bimodal Waveguide Interferometers Sensor; Polymer Waveguide; Clad Metals The bimodal waveguide (BiMW) biosensor is an innovative common path interferometric sensor based on the evanescent field detection principle. This biosensor allows for the direct detection of virtually any biomolecular interaction in a label-free scheme by using specific biorecognition elements. Due to its inherent ultrasensitivity, it has been employed for the monitoring of relevant nucleic-acid sequences such as mRNA transcripts or microRNAs present at the attomolarâ€“femtomolar concentration level in human samples. The application of the BiMW biosensor to detect these nucleic acids can be a powerful analytical tool for diagnosis and prognosis of complex illnesses, such as cancer, where these biomarkers play a major role. The BiMW sensor is fabricated using standard silicon-based microelectronics technology, which allows its miniaturization and cost-effective production, meeting the requirements of portability and disposability for the development of point-of-care (PoC) sensing platforms. In this chapter, we describe the working principle of the BiMW biosensor as well as its application for the analysis of nucleic acids. Concretely, we show a detailed description of DNA functionalization procedures and the complete analysis of two different RNA biomarkers for cancer diagnosis: (1) the analysis of mRNA transcripts generated by alternative splicing of Fas gene, and (2) the detection of miRNA 181a from urine liquid biopsies, for the early diagnosis of bladder cancer. The biosensing detection is performed by a direct assay in real time, by monitoring the changes in the intensity pattern of the light propagating through the BiMW biosensor, due to the hybridization of the target with the specific DNA probe previously functionalized on the BiMW sensor surface."
"Contingent Effect of Board Gender Diversity on Performance in Emerging Markets: Evidence from the Egyptian Revolution Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence The 2011 Egyptian revolution was associated with significant political and social upheaval, followed by societal changes and attempts by policymakers to reduce the marginalisation of women and promote their inclusion in the economy. Drawing on this background, the authors compare the effect of board gender diversity before and after the revolution. Results indicate that gender diversity in corporate boards is coupled with improvements in firm performance in the immediate post revolution phase. This evidence provides insights into the contextual factors related to diversity and performance relationship and supporting arguments for regulatory changes to further encourage womenâ€™s representation on boards."
"Higher Education in Times of Instability and Disruption: Rethinking Notions of Values, Value Creation and Instructional Practices in Vietnam and beyond Employability; Competency; Soft Skills The disruptive nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a massive shift in instructional practices in higher education across the globe. The impact of this pandemic on education globally has led to a surge in online teaching and the use of various digital technologies and platforms to support instructional practices. However, this world-changing event has foregrounded the limitations of technology in addition to other important indications, particularly as it relates to the notion of value and by extension value creation. Within the context of the Vietnamese higher education ecosystem, what is evident is that a re-evaluation of values is worth considering, in terms of the value of local higher education institutions, in addition to the value creation produced by the same. This article will engage with pertinent implications for the post-COVID realities which offer untold challenges and opportunities in Vietnam and elsewhere. Moreover, the post-COVID realities of late modernity only serve to accentuate the importance of values and value creation in this context as higher education institutions would re-evaluate, rethink, and retool approaches to instructional practices. A focus on questions of value aids in considering the broader conditions and contexts which support some of the fruitful and situated outcomes of higher education which includes human capital development, employment, social mobility and the production of modern social identities."
"Professional development needs of the international work-integrated learning community Placement; Cooperative Education; Employability Many governments are expecting higher education institutions to make strong links between the educational offerings and employability while many employers are demanding graduates with prior workplace or community engagement before entering the workplace. As higher education institutions respond to these challenges, work-integrated learning (WIL) is increasingly seen as a powerful educational approach in developing and empowering work-ready graduates, with many institutions expanding their WIL offerings. With the expansion of WIL, however, comes the need for more staffing to resource the activity. The type of staff vary from practitioners (placement coordinators, field practitioners), teaching staff, researchers, and curricular designers, all of whom require a relevant skills set and knowledge. However, to date, professional development opportunities directly related to WIL have been limited, with most opportunities offered by some national associations providing webinars and workshops. Furthermore, little work has been undertaken to determine the actual professional development needs of WIL staff. Presented here are the findings of an online, international survey of 668 WIL practitioners which explores their perceived professional development needs."
"Uncertainty quantification for space situational awareness and traffic management Helicopter; A-6 Aircraft; Airspace This paper presents a sensor-orientated approach to on-orbit position uncertainty generation and quantification for both ground-based and space-based surveillance applications. A mathematical framework based on the least squares formulation is developed to exploit real-time navigation measurements and tracking observables to provide a sound methodology that supports separation assurance and collision avoidance among Resident Space Objects (RSO). In line with the envisioned Space Situational Awareness (SSA) evolutions, the method aims to represent the navigation and tracking errors in the form of an uncertainty volume that accurately depicts the size, shape, and orientation. Simulation case studies are then conducted to verify under which sensors performance the method meets Gaussian assumptions, with a greater view to the implications that uncertainty has on the cyber-physical architecture evolutions and Cognitive Human-Machine Systems required for Space Situational Awareness and the development of a comprehensive Space Traffic Management framework."
"Template free mild hydrothermal synthesis of core-shell Cu2O(Cu)@CuO visible light photocatalysts for N-acetyl-para-aminophenol degradation Thin Films; Cathodes; Heterojunctions Solar photocatalytic processes are a promising approach to environmental remediation, however their implementation requires improvements in visible light harvesting and conversion and a focus on low cost, Earth abundant materials. Semiconducting copper oxides are promising visible light photocatalysts for solar fuels and wastewater depollution. Here we report the mild, hydrothermal (template-free) synthesis of core-shell Cu2O(Cu)@CuO photocatalytic architectures for the visible light photocatalytic degradation of N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP). Hollow and rattle-like core-shell nanosphere aggregates with diameters between 200 nm and 2.5 Î¼m formed under different synthesis conditions; all comprised an inner Cu2O shell, formed of 10-50 nm nanoparticles, surrounded by a protective corona of CuO nanoparticles. High reductant and structure-directing agent concentrations promoted the formation of a yolk-like Cu2O/Cu core, associated with improved photophysical properties, notably a high oxidation potential and suppressed charge carrier recombination, that correlated with the highest apparent quantum efficiency (8%) and rate of APAP removal (7 Î¼mol g-1 min-1). Trapping experiments demonstrated hydroxyl radicals were the primary active species responsible for APAP oxidation to quinones and short chain carboxylic acids. Rattle-like core-shell Cu2O/Cu@CuO nanospheres exhibited excellent physiochemical stability and recyclability for APAP photocatalytic degradation."
"Understanding the Experiences of Vietnamese Women Leaders: Advancing an Existential Philosophical and Psychological Perspective Vietnam; Intimate Partner Violence; Sexual Health The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the value(s) of existential philosophy and psychology for understanding womenâ€™s lives in a cross-cultural context. It focuses on Vietnamese women and the formation of their self-identity in the process of becoming a leader. Theoretically, we draw on the existential philosophy of Martin Heideggerâ€™s fundamental ontology that emphasizes being, temporality and context (thrownness), Simone de Beauvoirâ€™s account of gender and other pertinent existentialists. To illustrate the value of an existential perspective, we offer an empirical example of a Vietnamese womanâ€™s life-story (who was chosen because she is a leader), interpreting her self-identity as it unfolds over the life span. This approach has the potential to capture an individualsâ€™ diverse and complex modes of being, how they take part in shaping their reality through their situatedness in the world. The value of existentialism lies in its view of self-identity as a process of becoming, as opposed to a fixed and stable entity, providing the means for theorizing the possibilities for female agency, which addresses one of the limitations of the existing research on womenâ€™s leadership in Vietnam. Our analysis of the participantâ€™s life-story offers a case illustration of her encounters with the conditions of existence, which serve as important events, milestones, and turning points that promote a critical reflection on the role that culture, choice, and meaning plays in her life and leadership."
"Image-based sexual abuse: A feminist criminological approach Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica Contemporary digital society and culture can be characterized by an obsession with both the visual artifact and object. This is evidenced through contemporary voyeurism trends, such as reality television, live streaming, amateur pornography, as well as an increasing demand for â€œrealâ€ or â€œauthenticâ€ visual representations. In addition and related to these contemporary social trends, there is a continual shifting public/private divide, an ongoing fixation on bodies, particularly feminized bodies, as well as pre-existing structural inequalities on the basis of gender, race, sexuality, class, age, and ability. This complex interplay of social, cultural, and technological factors provides the contextual backdrop to understanding the prevalence, nature, and perpetration related to the taking and sharing non-consensual nude or sexual imagery - also known as image-based sexual abuse (IBSA). Further to structural factors underlying IBSA, it is also important to address the performativity of gender and subjectivity in understanding this phenomenon and thereby contribute to more informed responses and prevention interventions. In this chapter, we utilize feminist criminological theory for understanding the complex interplay of individual and structural causes of IBSA."
"Long-term effects of sewage sludge–derived biochar on the accumulation and availability of trace elements in a tropical soil Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Thermal treatment by pyrolysis has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to enable the agricultural use of sewage sludge. The solid product obtained via pyrolysis of sewage sludge is called sewage sludge biochar and presents several advantages for its use as a fertilizer or soil conditioner. However, there are concerns about the accumulation and dynamics of trace elements in soil amended with sewage sludge biochar over the years. This study examined the effect of sewage sludge biochar, under field conditions for 5 yr, on the accumulation and availability of trace elements in a tropical soil. For this, 15 t haâ€“1 of sewage sludge biochar produced at 300 and 500 Â°C were applied in the first two growing seasons. Application was interrupted from the third to the fifth seasons to assess the residual effect of sewage sludge biochar in the soil. The total and available trace element concentrations were determined. The total contents of trace elements showed the following variation in the soil over the 5 yr (mg kgâ€“1): Cd (16.8â€“20.0), Co (19.5â€“21.5), Cr (98.2â€“125.7), Cu (8.1â€“17.1), Mn (62.9â€“85.7), Ni (20.3â€“35.0), Pb (27.0â€“52.4), and Zn (20.3â€“35.8). There was no change in the availability of Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb over the years. Additionally, a residual effect of the sewage sludge biochar was the increase in availability of trace elements that are considered essential (Cu, Mn, and Zn) and beneficial elements (Co) for plants. Therefore, in relation to contamination by trace elements, the pyrolysis of sewage sludge of domestic origin proved to be an adequate strategy to enable the safe use of this residue in tropical agriculture."
"Health promotion at the workplace setting: A protocol for a systematic review of effectiveness and sustainability of current practice in low-income and middle-income countries Presenteeism; Health Promotion; Workplace Introduction Low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are experiencing a growing disease burden due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Changing behavioural practices, such as diets high in saturated fat, salt and sugar and sedentary lifestyles, have been associated with the increase in NCDs. Health promotion at the workplace setting is considered effective in the fight against NCDs and has been reported to yield numerous benefits. However, there is a need to generate evidence on the effectiveness and sustainability of workplace health promotion practice specific to LMICs. We aim to synthesise the current literature on workplace health promotion in LMICs focusing on interventions effectiveness and sustainability. Methods and analysis We will conduct a systematic review of published studies from LMICs up to 31 March 2019. We will search the following databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest and CINAHL. Two reviewers will independently screen potential articles for inclusion and disagreements will be resolved by consensus. We will appraise the quality and risk of bias of included studies using two tools from the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. We will present a narrative overview and assessment of the body of evidence derived from the comprehensive review of the studies. The reported outcomes will be summarised by study design, duration, intensity/frequency of intervention delivery and by the six-priority health promotion action areas set out in the Ottawa Charter. We will conduct a thematic analysis to identify the focus areas of current interventions. This systematic review protocol has been prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta- analyses for Protocols 2015 statement. Ethics and dissemination This study does not require ethics approval. We will disseminate the results of this review through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. Trial registration number CRD42018110853."
"Austropuccinia psidii on the move: survey based insights to its geographical distribution, host species, impacts and management in Australia Puccinia Psidii; Myrtus; Rust Disease Austropuccinia psidii is a plant fungus native to South and Central America which causes myrtle rust disease, affecting the growth and reproduction of species in the Myrtaceae family. Austropuccinia psidii was first detected in Australia 8 years ago in New South Wales. Since then it has spread rapidly along the east coast, and to date is known to infect more than 375 native Myrtaceae species in Australia. Despite this, its rapid spread is not well documented and the potential threat to additional Myrtaceae species remains unknown, with no systematic surveillance or monitoring program in Australia. In order to better understand the extent of A. psidii geographic distribution and impacts on Australian landscapes, a survey was sent to national park, botanical garden, local council, nursery and forestry agency employees in all states and territories where the disease is known to be present. More than 500 surveys were sent, and 254 responses were received. The survey confirms that A. psidii is widespread in New South Wales and Queensland urban environments as well as in native vegetation communities. Four new host species were confirmed, as well as four new local government areas in two different states reporting A. psidii infection. The disease severity was classified as medium to high for most host species, with especially negative impacts for Rhodamnia rubescens and Rhodomyrtus psidioides. These survey results provide up-to-date information on the geographical distribution, host species and impacts of A. psidii, which will assist in making management decisions relating to this pathogen across Australia."
"Disability, technology innovation and social development in China and Australia Social Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Impact Investing This paper examines the turn to technology innovation in disability policy, as it has manifested in the accessibility and digital inclusion agendas in China and Australia. It provides a review of the disability policy changes and related initiatives in both countries to offer insights for broader discussions of digital technology innovation and social policy in Asia. We argue that while governments take pivotal roles in formulating and implementing digital disability policies, people with disabilities apply their own agency to take advantage of market opportunities through economic participation in digital economy. The state responds positively to the agency of people with disabilities in social development and participation by opening opportunities for research grants, start-up funds, publicities and policy lobbying. It is here we see the hope in such a collaborative and mutually constitutive approach to innovative social policies that aim at inclusive and sustainable growthâ€“something that deserves concerted, comparative research and evaluation by policy scholars."
"Scientometric review of construction demolition waste management: a global sustainability perspective Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management The increase in construction projects with rising construction demolition waste (CDW) challenges is alarming, and it poses a significant threat to sustainable urban development. The challenge of CDW management (CDWM) is noteworthy with varied consequences on social, economic, environmental, and physical development perspectives. Although there has been research from different perspectives on CDWM for over 40 years, there is a limited scientometric review research in these areas to date. This study, therefore, conducts a global scientometric analysis of CDWM articles to understand its sustainable development research approach for further studies. Article titles, keywords, and abstract search methods were used to extract related articles from the year 2000 to 2021. A total of 4374 articles retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection were analysed using CiteSpace software for scientometric analysis. The result revealed active research on CDWM from influential researchers, research institutes, institutions, reputable journals, and countries. The policy recommendations and frameworks adopted in the past have focused more on reducing, recycling and reuse (3R), and they adopt these strategies and others as single strategies for improving CDWM. These strategies are limited in integrating sustainable development strategies such as the circular economy and bio-dynamic. This study concludes that there is a need for a comprehensive research approach that incorporates the economic, social, and physical implications of CDWM to maximise the value of CDW for sustainable development. It presents a comprehensive scientometric analysis of the CDWM, adds to the existing knowledge of CDWM sustainability approach, and provides insights for future research direction relevant for the academics, professionals, and government agencies in CDWM projects."
"Agreement study between color and IR retinal images based on retinal vasculature morphological parameters Retinal; Hypertension Retinopathy; Retina Vein Background: Color fundus photography have been extensively used to explore the link between retinal morphology changes associated with various disease i.e. Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma. The development of multimodal imaging system that integrates Infrared Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (IR-SLO) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) could help in studying these diseases at an early stage. The aim of this study was to test the agreement between the retinal vasculature parameters from the Infrared images obtained from optical coherence tomography and color fundus imaging. Methods: The IR and Color retinal images were obtained from 16 volunteer participants and seven retinal vessel parameters, i.e. Fractal Dimension (FD), Average Angle (ABA), Total Angle Count (TAC), Tortuosity (ST), Vessel/Background ratio (VBR), Central Retinal Arteriolar Equivalent (CRAE) and Central Retinal Venular Equivalent (CRVE) were extracted from these retinal images using Retinal Image Vasculature Assessment software (RIVAS) and Integrative Vessel Analysis (IVAN). Results: The Bland Altman plot was used to investigate the agreement between the two modalities. The paired sample t-test was used to assess the presence of fixed bias and the slope of Least Square Regression (LSR) line for the presence of proportional bias. The paired sample t-test showed that there was no statistically significant difference between Color and IR based on retinal vessel features (all p values > 0.05). LSR also revealed no statistically significant difference in the retinal vessel features between Color and IR. Conclusion: This study has revealed that there is a fair agreement between Color and IR images based on retinal vessel features. This research has shown that it is possible to use IR images of the retina to measure the retinal vasculature parameters which has the advantage of being flash-less, can be used even if there is opacity due to cataract, and can be performed along with OCT on the same device."
"A comparison of abundance and distribution model outputs using camera traps and sign surveys for feral pigs Swine; Feral; Crop Damage Species distribution models play a central role in informing wildlife management. For models to be useful, they must be based on data that best represent the presence or abundance of the species. Data used as inputs in the development of these models can be obtained through numerous methods, each subject to different biases and limitations but, to date, few studies have examined whether these biases result in different predictive spatial models, potentially influencing conservation decisions. In this study, we compare distribution model predictions of feral pig (Sus scrofa) relative abundance using the two most common monitoring methods: detections from camera traps and visual surveys of pig sign. These data were collected during the same period using standardised methods at survey sites generated using a random stratified sampling design. We found that although site-level observed sign data were only loosely correlated with observed camera detections (R2 = 0.32-0.45), predicted sign and camera counts from zero-inflated models were well correlated (R2 = 0.78-0.88). In this study we show one example in which fitting two different forms of abundance data using environmental covariates explains most of the variance between datasets. We conclude that, as long as outputs are produced through appropriate modelling techniques, these two common methods of obtaining abundance data may be used interchangeably to produce comparable distribution maps for decision-making purposes. However, for monitoring purposes, sign and camera trap data may not be used interchangeably at the site level."
"Applying Learning Analytics to the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Online Courses; Mooc; Blended Learning In this article we report on the findings of a project funded by the Australian Office for Learning and Teaching and entitled â€œLearning Analytics: Assisting Universities with Student Retention.â€ While this project was primarily focused on retention as a potential outcome of learning analytics, its application could be related to the broader concept of student success. Student success allows for a focus on pedagogy and the use of learning analytics for the improvement of learning and teaching with a firm scholarly evidence base. The data gathered for the project provide the background for a discussion about the potential of learning analytics to inform the practice of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. A case study demonstrates the potential of this approach. Overall, clear pedagogical questions are important in the application of learning analytics to the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, and we suggest potential ways to explore pedagogical questions with big data methods."
"Gender Equality Prior to and Following Separation: Nordic and Liberal Policy Inconsistencies One Child Policy; Family Planning Policy; Dual-Earner We compare family policy in Australia and Finland, focusing on child support as interrogating how gender equality ideals and realities play out when families diverge from the dual-parent model. Despite Finland's de-gendered leave and employment policy, a gender wage gap continues to position mothers as primary carers. In Australia, pre-separation policies are gendered in that leave benefits position mothers as primary carers. In both countries, child support policy took the opposite approach. Finland's child support policy provides less incentive for the father to take care of children post-separation."
"Short-term effects of a sewage sludge biochar amendment on total and available heavy metal content of a tropical soil Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon The production of biochar is a technological alternative to transform sewage sludge (SS) into a useful product for agro-environmental purposes. Despite an increased knowledge on the role of sewage sludge biochar (SSB) for improving soil quality and crop productivity, some concerns remain regarding the accumulation of total and available heavy metals (HM) in soils amended with SSB. Particularly, there is a dearth of studies under field conditions and in tropical latitudes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of applying SS biochars, prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures, on the accumulation and availability of heavy metals (HM). To do so, 15 Mg ha âˆ’1 of SS biochar produced at 300 Â°C (BC300) and 500 Â°C (BC500) were applied to a soil cultivated with corn. Total and available levels of HM in SS, biochars and post-harvest soil were determined. Pyrolysis concentrated total HM in the biochars in relation to the SS. However, HM availability was reduced with increasing pyrolysis temperature due to an increase in pH, pore volume, specific surface area, P and K content, and reduction of the H/C ratio. Biochar did not alter the total HM contents, with the exception of Mn. Available levels of all HM in the soil were <1.2% of the total contents. In addition, the available levels of Zn and Mn, when evaluated as micronutrients, were considered low. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that biochar produced from SS of a sewage treatment plant processing predominantly domestic sewage can be used in agriculture, without risk of soil contamination by HM. Moreover, in some tropical soils, with a low value of micronutrients, biochar can provide a source of these elements."
"Passengers’ perceived ability to get out safely from an underground train station in an emergency situation Pedestrian; Evacuation; Crowds Many recent studies have been done on the development of evacuation systems and plans. There are also several studies on human behaviour in fire. However, little research has been done to understand how peoplesâ€™ likely behaviour relates to their perceived ability to get out safely during an emergency, especially in a major transport hub like an underground train station. This study explores the beliefs and perceptions of 1134 train passengers and finds that those who report that they are likely to move to the exit immediately, wait for directions from the station staff, wait at assembly areas, help others with difficulties, choose the least crowded exit and/or use the escalators to get out also report that they expect to get out safely. In contrast, passengers who report that they are likely to do nothing and/or push others if necessary also report that they are less likely to get out safely."
"Advances in real-time monitoring of water quality using automated analysis of animal behaviour Bivalvia; Affectedness; Corbicula Fluminea Monitoring of freshwater quality and its potential sudden contamination is integral to human health, sustainable economic development and prediction of pollutant impact on aquatic ecosystems. Although there have been significant advances in technologies for automated sampling and continuous analysis of water physicochemical parameters, the current capabilities for real-time warning against rapidly developing unknown mixtures of chemical hazards are still limited. Conventional chemical analysis systems are not suitable for assessing unknown mixtures of chemicals as well as additive and/or synergetic effects on biological systems. From the perspective of neurotoxicology the acute exposures to chemical agents that affect nervous system and can enter the freshwater supplies accidentally or as a result of deliberate action, can only be reliably assessed using appropriate functional biological models. In this regard real-time biological early warning systems (BEWS), that can continuously monitor behavioural and/or physiological parameters of suitable aquatic bioindicator species, have been historically proposed to fill the gap and supplement conventional water quality test strategies. Alterations in sub-lethal neuro-behavioural traits have been proven as very sensitive and physiologically relevant endpoints that can provide highly integrative water quality sensing capabilities. Although BEWS are commonly regarded as non-specific and lacking both quantitative and qualitative detection capabilities, their advantages, if properly designed and implemented, lie in continuous sensing and early-warning information about sudden alteration in water quality parameters. In this work we review the future prospects of real-time biological early warning systems as well as recent developments that are anchored in historical successes and practical deployment examples. We concentrate on technologies utilizing analysis of behavioural and physiological endpoints of animal bioindicators and highlight the existing challenges, barriers to future development and demonstrate how recent advances in inexpensive electronics and multidisciplinary bioengineering can help revitalize the BEWS field."
"The politics of greening unceded lands in the settler city Repatriation; Archaeological Practice; Cultural Resource Management Urban greening is a buzz term in urban policy and research settings in Australia and elsewhere. In a context of settler colonial urbanism, like Australia, a first fact becomes clear: urban greening is always being practiced on unceded Indigenous lands. Recognising this requires some honest reckoning with how this latest urban policy response perpetuates dispossessory settler-colonial structures. In this paper, we listen to the place-based ontologies of the peoples and lands from where we write to inform understanding the city as an always already Indigenous placeâ€“a sovereign Aboriginal City. In so doing, the paper tries to practice a way of creating more truthful and response-able urban knowledge practices. We analyse three distinct areas of scholarly research that are present in the contemporary literature: urban greening and green infrastructure; urban political ecology; and more-than-human cities. When placed in relationship of learning with the sovereign Aboriginal City, our analysis finds that these scholarly domains of urban greening work to re-organise colonial power relations. The paper considers what work the practice and scholarship of â€˜urban greeningâ€™ might need to do in order to become response-able and learn to learn with Indigenous sovereignties and ontologies."
"Optimal process integration architectures in off-site construction: Theorizing the use of multi-skilled resources Prefabricated Buildings; China; Precast Concrete The architecture, engineering and construction industry has long dealt with problems such as schedule and budget overruns, quality and safety issues, and low productivity. Off-site construction, which is a hybrid of manufacturing and construction, has significant potential to address industryâ€™s endemic problems. However, off-site construction has been criticized for replicating the traditional subcontracting approach and therefore fragmented practice in the construction industry. The current research focuses on process integration and cross-training of multi-skilled resources as a solution to the aforementioned problem. To identify optimal process integration architectures for off-site construction, production data of three off-site manufacturers were analyzed by using a hybrid of fuzzy theory and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution. Findings reveal that process integration architectures transferring excess capacity from under-utilized to over-utilized resources in direct or indirect pathways are preferable in terms of satisfying decision criteria such as time and cost of cross-training, skill transferability, compliance with network logic, and safety considerations. The study contributes to the off-site construction literature by providing insight into dynamics of using multi-skilled resources. It also contributes to practice by developing a customizable and user-friendly framework for off-site production managers in order to identify the optimal process integration architecture in their own production scenarios."
"Human-machine interfaces and interactions for multi UAS operations Helicopter; A-6 Aircraft; Airspace Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) offer many opportunities in a wide range of industries to support remote sensing and surveillance. While platform autonomy and intelligence have seen large advances in recent decades, a key challenge is the operation of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) by a single operator in 'one-to-many' operations. To support one-to-many operations, higher levels of human-autonomy teaming are required, where human operators collaborate with autonomous agents through the use of adaptive Human-Machine Interfaces and Interactions (HMI 2 ). In this paper, the one-to-many concept is applied to a bushfire-fighting scenario. The paper presents the UAV avionics systems design along with the Ground Control Station (GCS) design, which features a number of emerging HMI 2 concepts."
"Deterioration of transportation infrastructures: Corrosion of reinforcements in concrete structures Carbonation; Carbon Dioxide; Curing (Nonfood Products) The considerable network of transportation infrastructures such as highways, rails, and so forth are key providers to economic growth and productivity of countries. Consecutively, Reinforced Concrete (RC) is the predominant construction materials in constructing many of these infrastructures. RC is a unique construction material which allows flexible design layouts and offers safe bending and torsion to satisfy design requirements. However, being exposed to harsh environment and contamination such as salts, acid rain, distilled water, carbonation, sulphur and so on are the reasons for deterioration, thus significantly impacting the performance of these structures. Furthermore, the deterioration of these structures is not only a safety issue, but also an economic concern. Moreover, deterioration of concrete infrastructures can be attributed to many factors from structural deficiency to corrosion of reinforcement and thermal expansion due to fire damage. Accordingly, this paper will review the corrosion of reinforcements in concrete transportation Structures, and in doing so it will also examine some of the novel deterioration models to prolong concrete transportation structures."
"Water footprint: applying the water footprint assessment method to Australian agriculture Water Footprint; Water-Energy Nexus; Nexus BACKGROUND: Water footprint assessment is essential for the evaluation of water scarcity that considers both direct and indirect water consumption along the supply chain. This paper presents the estimation of water footprint for locally grown fruits and vegetables in Australia. Water footprint was calculated based on the framework developed in the Water Footprint Assessment Manual for the crops which are the most practicable to grow in Australia. Nine different crops (apples, grapes, tomatoes, oranges, peaches/nectarines, cherries, potatoes, carrots/turnips and almonds) in the agricultural industry were selected and identified as the most water-consumptive crop and least water-consumptive crop. For each type of crop, the three main water footprint components (blue, green, and grey water) were calculated. RESULTS: It was found that almond had the highest water footprint (6671.96 m3 tonâˆ’1) and tomato had the lowest water footprint (212.24 m3 tonâˆ’1) in Australia. From the global comparison, it is revealed that total water footprint for Australian crops is much higher than the corresponding international average values, except for tomatoes, potatoes and almonds. Also, almonds had the highest water footprint among the nine crops investigated. CONCLUSION: The study provides an insight into future sustainable cropping patterns in Australia, which suggest that tomatoes, carrots/turnips, potatoes and apples should continue to be grown in Australia, whereas stone fruit (e.g., almonds) should no longer be grown because of its high water footprint.

"Microplastics and pollutants in biosolids have contaminated agricultural soils: An analytical study and a proposal to cease the use of biosolids in farmlands and utilise them in sustainable bricks Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Treated waste-water sludge (biosolids) are frequently recycled in agricultural lands; however, this practice has polluted soils with microplastics (MPs), nanoplastics (NPs), synthetics, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals and engineered nanoparticles. This study analyses many of the significant research outcomes in this area and proposes the urgent reduction of biosolids recycling in farmlands, aiming to eliminate their use altogether as soon as practicable, and instead, to utilise this material as a source of brick firing energy in the manufacturing of fired clay bricks and as a replacement for virgin brick soil. Based on a comprehensive data analysis, this study has calculated that in the European Union, the United States, China, Canada and Australia, approximately 26,042, 21,249, 13,660, 1,518 and 1,241 tonnes of microplastics, respectively, are added to farmlands annually as a result of biosolids application. The accumulation of microplastics produces detrimental effects on soil organisms and increases the accumulation of other micropollutants, such as heavy metals. The degradation of MPs over time is a source for the creation of nanoplastics, which pose a greater threat to ecosystems and human and animal health, as their size allows for their absorption into plant cells. On the other hand, the results of a comprehensive study at RMIT, including a comprehensive Life-Cycle Assessment, confirm that recycling biosolids in fired clay bricks (Bio-Bricks) is a promising sustainable alternative. This study proposes the mandatory addition of 7% biosolids in all brick manufacturing worldwide to utilize all biosolids production in fired clay bricks. This will reduce brick firing energy by over 12.5%."
"Numerical investigation of an RBCC combustor during ramjet/scramjet mode transition Cavity; Supersonic Combustion; Rocket-based Combined-cycle Engines Rocket-based Combined-Cycle (RBCC) engines offer a promise for efficient and flexible propulsion over a large Mach number range by combining rocket and ramjet/scramjet technology. To achieve this, an RBCC engine uses four different modes of operation: rocket, ramjet, scramjet and dual-mode. During operation, the engine must make the transition from subsonic to supersonic combustion, i.e., ramjet to scramjet mode. The objective of this study is to gain physical insight into the ramjet-scramjet-ramjet mode transition by elucidating the underlying mechanics. Numerical simulations with chemical reactions have been performed for the transient flowfields of a two-dimensional RBCC combustor by using an unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes solver. Mode transition is effected by changing the flow rate of the secondary hydrogen fuel injectors installed on the top and bottom walls of the combustor. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the characteristic and behavior of RBCC combustion in mode transition. The results indicated that transition is affected considerably by the presence and development of flow separation and pseudo-shock structures near fuel injectors. The complex effects of aerodynamic and aerothermal interactions on the transient flowfields and performance, along with a hysteresis observed between the scramjet-to-ramjet and ramjet-to-scramjet transition processes."
"Applying a Gendered Lens to the Stay and Defend or Leave Early Approach to Bushfire Safety Wildfires; Wildland-Urban Interface; Disaster This paper provides an historical and cultural context, from a feminist perspective, of the Prepare, Stay and Defend or Leave Early (PSDLE) bushfire safety policy, colloquially known as â€˜Stay or Goâ€™, in Australia. We examine the historical, cultural, and political factors that have devalued and marginalised women's experience and knowledge of bushfire preparedness and response. The central tenet of Stay or Go is that able bodied, prepared people should remain with their houses during a fire threat, best embodied by the common maxim â€˜people save houses and houses save peopleâ€™. This approach has been routinely presented as evidence-based policy but the argument presented here challenges the evidence base for the policy by applying a feminist analysis, through the application of a â€˜gendered lensâ€™. This shows that an assumed masculine norm, at a number of different levels, has had a profound effect on the dominant readings of the available evidence about bushfire safety which has skewed bushfire safety policy and compromised the possibility of effective alternative responses. The PSDLE/Stay or Go policy is a prime example of the importance of applying critical feminist analyses to unsettle existing assumptions of policy development and implementation."
"‘She doesn’t think that happens’: When heterosexual men say no to sex Young; Sex Education; Sexuality Dominant understandings of menâ€™s sexuality claim that men are always up for sex; as such, research on heterosexual menâ€™s sexual refusals is sparse. Drawing on interviews conducted with young people (aged 18â€“23) living in and around Melbourne, Australia, this article explores three young peopleâ€™s experiences of men saying â€˜noâ€™ to a womanâ€™s request for sex within an ongoing relationship. In each of these instances the refusal was, to some extent, not respected. This presents a challenge to menâ€™s masculinity which then needs to be redressed through compensatory manhood acts. This article explores how the truth claims of hegemonic masculinity and the male sexual drive discourse are reproduced through men and womenâ€™s social interactions, and unpacks the implications of menâ€™s sexual refusals not being heard for sexual ethics education programmes."
"Financialization and income inequality: An extreme bounds analysis Financialization; Household Debt; Capitalism Several theoretical hypotheses predict conflicting effects of financialization on income inequality, and the lack of consensus is reinforced by the mixed findings of related empirical studies. In this paper we address the model uncertainty issue by applying extreme bounds analysis (EBA) to examine the robustness of financialization variables as determinants of income inequality. The results suggest that financialization is a leading driver of income inequality and that the effects are larger when transmitted through financial markets. In addition, the results show that law and order, labour union density, population, globalization, remittances, education, and the agriculture sector share are also robust determinants of income inequality. Policy recommendations are put forward to reduce the power of the financial sector."
"Modeling a Digital Twin to Predict Battery Deterioration with Lower Prediction Error in Smart Devices: From the Internet of Things Sensor Devices to Self-Driving Cars Battery Pack; Electrode; Thermal Management The complete life cycle management of complex equipment is seen as critical to the smart transformation and upgrading of today's industrial industry. In recent years, digital twin (DT) technology and machine learning (ML) have arisen as emerging technologies. Developing technologies like DT technology and ML in entire battery life cycle management may make each stage of the life cycle more predictable and proactive. We propose a hybrid DT model based on ML that can enhance the performance of an existing DT mathematical model formulated to simulate lithium-ion battery deterioration behavior using DT technology. Firstly, we develop a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based model to forecast the error term of battery capacity enumerated for each charge and discharge cycle from the existing DT model. In this work, we use 18,650 lithium-ion battery discharge data from NASA Ames' prognostics data repository as our experimental data. The LSTM model is configured with Adam optimizer and the mean absolute error (MAE) loss function. The early stopping criterion is also employed as a regularization technique to overcome model overfitting. Secondly, we develop our proposed hybrid DT by integrating both the existing DT and the LSTM model. Thirdly, we formulate an empirical mathematical model, which allows us to better replicate behavior of battery degradation of any lithium-ion battery. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid DT in terms of the MAE metric. Compared with the existing model, our proposed model reduces the error of battery capacity during the entire degradation period by 68.42%."
"Optimization of Arsenic Fixation in the Pressure Oxidation of Arsenopyrite Using Response Surface Methodology Scorodite; Tooeleite; Arsenic Arsenic is a common pollutant and impurity present in complex gold ores. In the pressure oxidation (POX) of refractory gold-bearing sulfides, a major environmental challenge is the treatment of the hazardous waste released from arsenic-bearing minerals during processing. While the bulk removal of arsenic from solution can occur during POX, the formation of stable arsenates relies on the operating conditions during POX and the subsequent curing stage. Herein, response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design have been investigated as viable approaches for optimizing arsenic fixation during the curing of the POX product of arsenopyrite. Curing time (0â€“24 h) and temperature (60â€“120Â°C) were examined as the model variables for RSM optimization, and the performance was assessed via arsenic and iron precipitation, along with the change in free acid and sulfate concentrations. Experimental validation of the optimized model conditions demonstrated good agreement with the simulated outputs and provided a 10% increase in arsenic removal over the best model input. The formation of basic ferric arsenate sulfate and scorodite under these conditions was supported by RSM and confirmed via characterization. In the investigated system, the maximum arsenic removal occurs at a critical threshold temperature of 107Â°C, over which the scorodite formation decreases with temperature. Thermodynamic modeling revealed the preferable formation of soluble FeHAsO4+ complexes over scorodite above this threshold temperature, decreasing arsenic fixation at higher temperatures."
"Adapting Mussar to Develop Management Students’ Character Aristotle; Virtue Ethics; Human Flourishing Management educators have been advised to cultivate their studentsâ€™ character. Yet they lack the instructional resources they need to do so. We were inspired by the principles and techniques of the Jewish spiritual practice of Mussar to put students on a personalized path of continuous character improvement. According to Mussar, everyone has some measure of a given character trait and needs to calibrate it to fill in a deficiency or tone down an excess. Although correcting character deficiencies and excesses requires a commitment of effort, we can, and should, become better versions of ourselves by applying that effortâ€”that is, engaging in reflection, setting goals, monitoring our progress, and making adjustmentsâ€”to move each of our character traits ever closer to its respective virtuous mean. We have designed materials to increase studentsâ€™ awareness of character and its importance in organizations, give them a vocabulary of character traits, help them identify the character traits they would like to address, and provide them with a sustainable process for self-enhancement. In this article, we introduce these materials and provide evidence of their effectiveness."
"The uncommon Nightingale: Sustainable housing innovation in Australia Energy Transition; Innovation System; Sustainability There is a need to deliver more environmentally and socially sustainable housing if we are to achieve a transition to a low carbon future. There are examples of innovative and sustainable housing emerging around the world which challenge the deeper structures of the existing housing regime. This paper uses the analysis of socio-technical dimensions of eco-housing presented by Smithto explore the development of an emerging sustainable housing model known as Nightingale Housing in Australia within a sustainability transitions framing. While there were several similarities to Smith's analysis (e.g., establishment of guiding principles, learning by doing), there were also some key differences, including the scaling up of sustainable housing while using tried and tested design principles, materials and technologies, and creating changes to user relations, policy, and culture. Smith's dimensions remain a good framework for understanding sustainable housing development, but they must be located within a scaling up sustainable housing agenda. What is required now is to develop a better understanding of the processes and opportunities that such housing models offer policy makers, housing researchers, and building industry stakeholders to achieve a broader scale uptake of sustainable housing both in Australia and globally."
"Introduction: social media and Chinese digital diaspora in Australia Human Migration; Diasporas; Acculturation This article explores two contested concepts: Chinese digital diaspora and social media. It signposts two issues central to the special issue that analyses the roles of digital and social media in the lives of Chinese migrants in Australia, that is, (1) WeChat and other digital platforms in enabling civic participation in Australian socio-economic, cultural, and political lives; (2) the impact of such digital practices on their identity and citizenship."
"Microfinance and child mortality Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion Microfinance institutions (MFIs) offer targeted opportunities for the poor to generate additional income with a range of financial services including credit, insurance, savings accounts and money transfers. Aside from reducing poverty, microfinance can potentially improve health because it is the poor who are usually more constrained from health investments due to limited budgets. Furthermore, microfinancing specifically targets women, who are more likely to spend additional income on childrenâ€™s well-being. Finally, several MFIs have also begun to offer health-related services, such as health education, health-care financing, clinical care, training community health workers, health micro-insurance and linkages to public and private health providers. Using a new data set, this article conducts the first multi-country study of the effect of microfinance on child mortality, the health outcome, which is most sensitive to the effects of absolute deprivation. Our findings confirm that an increase in the proportion of MFI clients in a country is significantly associated with lower under-five and infant mortality rates. We conclude that if MFIsâ€™ educational and health services have indeed caused improvements in health outcomes at the community level, then it may be important for governments to complement these activities with similar campaigns, particularly in remote areas where MFI penetration is low."
"Policing repeat and high-risk family violence: police and service-sector perceptions of a coordinated model Domestic Violence; Intimate Partner Violence; Police Family violence forms a significant part of police-work, with many police agencies adopting evolving responses to family violence over time. This article presents the qualitative findings of a mixed-method evaluation of â€˜Alexisâ€™, a coordinated police-social-services approach to family violence piloted in the state of Victoria, Australia. In-depth interviews were conducted with 14 stakeholders (7 police members and 7 community service providers) to examine perceptions of how the model was working and how it differed from other policing approaches to family violence. Five key themes were extracted from the data via thematic analysis: (i) collaboration between police, an embedded family violence worker and other agencies; (ii) increased police accountability; (iii) adoption of a proactive major crime approach; (iv) emphasis on professional development; and (v) the allocation of dedicated time and resources. Implications for future policy development are discussed, with the findings highlighting promising practices for policing high-risk and recidivist family violence."
"Ultra-Thin lead oxide piezoelectric layers for reduced environmental contamination using a liquid metal-based process Antenna; Galinstan; Ecoflex Mitigation of the health hazards and environmental pollution caused by Pb is necessary. However, piezoelectric Pb containing compounds, such as PZT, are still widely used in many industries and health sectors. One approach to reduce the hazards and contamination caused by Pb is to decrease the amount of this element in the devices by size reduction. In this regard, the possibility of using ultra-Thin piezoelectric PbO films should be investigated. However, to date, the development of such two-dimensional (2D) PbO films, in large lateral dimensions, has faced certain challenges. Here a liquid metal-based 2D printing technique is employed to produce unit-cell thick PbO sheets by harvesting the interfacial oxide layer of liquid Pb. The resulting PbO monolayer, with lateral dimensions of hundreds of microns, exhibits an orthorhombic crystal phase with a wide direct band gap of 3.3 eV, larger than that of its bulk counterpart. In addition, remarkable vertical piezoelectric coefficients of âˆ¼30 pm V-1 were obtained in unit-cell thick PbO through both measurements and density functional theory calculations. The PbO monolayers can be employed as an environmentally friendly alternative to PZT, in many commercial applications, due to the low content of Pb. This journal is"
"Identifying future health professionals’ understanding of the determinants of health Qualitative Research; Visual Methods; Community-Based Participatory Research Background: An understanding of the determinants of health is essential for all health professionals to be able to contribute to health promotion and disease prevention. Method: This project sought to explore first-year studentsâ€™ understanding of determinants of health through a photograph essay assessment. Results: Approximately one third of the students chose to depict social determinants of health, such as poverty and homelessness. Other determinants, such as individual human behavior, physical determinants, and policy, were less frequently selected. Content analysis of the studentsâ€™ photograph essay indicated two themes regarding approaches they believed could be used to improve equityâ€” Education, and The Role of the Government. Conclusion: Given the expectations of health professionals to contribute to health promotion and disease prevention in their communities, the findings from this study provide evidence for the need to develop new teaching and learning strategies to more effectively prepare health professional students for the future."
"When Ethics is a Technical Matter: Engineers’ Strategic Appeal to Ethical Considerations in Advocating for System Integrity Safety Climate; Accident; Health Management Situated in critiques of the â€œmoral mutenessâ€ of technical rationality, we examine concepts of ethics and the avoidance of ethical language among Australian gas pipeline engineers. We identify the domains in which they saw ethics as operating, including public safety, environmental protection, sustainability, commercial probity, and modern slavery. Particularly with respect to ethical matters that bear on public safety, in the course of design and operational activities, engineers principally advocated for action using technical language, avoiding reference to potential consequences such as death or destruction of property. Within their organizations, they saw themselves as occupying a technical â€œline of defenseâ€. We argue that this focus on technical language is action-oriented. Ethics tells practitioners of unacceptable outcomes, but it does not guide them in what they need to do to avoid that outcome in practice. We observed some cases where engineers had not made the connection between their role and ethics in the sense of public safety. We argue that muteness on ethical matters can obscure the nature of the risk where technical advice is being taken on by non-technical actors, and where technical actors themselves do not have a clear sense of their public safety obligations."
"Accountability and transparency in disaster aid: Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu Aid; Official Development Assistance; International Cooperation The world's largest humanitarian donors and implementing organisations have recently re-affirmed their commitments to financial transparency and broader accountability when responding to humanitarian crises. These are important demonstrations of the international community's on-going efforts to shift more power to those affected by disasters and to help ensure their dignity throughout the response and recovery efforts. This paper takes these commitments and applies them to the international humanitarian response following TC Pam in Vanuatu to gain greater insight into the implementation of these high-level goals. TC Pam caused massive damage as it tracked across Vanuatu in March 2015 and is still the largest tropical cyclone on record in the south Pacific. This paper clarifies the following contributions: USD 37.04 m to the response efforts, and USD 147.45 m to the on-going recovery from the tropical cyclone. It documents where that money came from, where it went, and what impact it has had to date using only publicly available data. The paper proceeds with analysis of the level of transparency and accountability to the people and communities affected by the disaster, rather than to foreign donors. This analysis shows relatively high transparency of financial flows during the response phase, but low transparency in the recovery phase. Furthermore, there is little evidence of accountability to affected populations through the transparency of information about the impact of the aid provided following TC Pam. This paper concludes with some recommendations to increase financial transparency and broader accountability following disasters."
"Infrastructure Financing for Climate Change Adaptation in Australia: Practitioners’ Perspectives Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience With increased climate-related risks and natural disasters, impacts on infrastructure assets are intensifying. As the need for adaptation actions increase, how finance is used to enable adaptation plays a vital role in the resilience of infrastructure. This research aims to understand how infrastructure adaptation measures are carried out, focusing on how financing is used to aid such efforts. Exploratory interviews with infrastructure and finance practitioners from a broad range of organisations were conducted to understand the dynamics of how infrastructure adaptation occurs. The findings reveal that infrastructure agencies conduct adaptation activities to maintain the serviceability of assets under climate change risks, with most climate financing targeting mitigation rather than adaptation. Most actions are taken at individual asset or agency level with little collaboration across agencies and sectors. The results illustrate a need for a more holistic, systems-level approach to adaptation across the infrastructure sector in Australia."
"Healthcare service, food security, and sustainable development: Main reasons to grow opium poppy in Myanmar Rohingya (People); Military Government; Junta This chapter aims to analyze discrimination and disadvantage of local farmers in the process of opium eradication in Myanmar based on their specific explanations. The author utilizes some data and information collected from official reports and statements of the Myanmar Opium Farmers' Forum (2013-2018). Some multiple sources from inside and outside Myanmar in terms of human rights of ethnic minorities' opium farmers are also added. The current findings point out that there are a number of concerns and disadvantages with local opium farmers to look for survival livelihood, food security, and sustainable development in ethnic minorities' communities in Myanmar, particularly at Shan and Kachin States. The chapter also calls for further researches with specific recommendations and effective solutions for local opium farmers in the next stages."
"Women must be equal partners in science: Gender-balance lessons from biology Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science Access to scientific careers for women has never been easy, but as biases and barriers slowly begin to diminish, women are becoming more and more involved in science, especially Biological Sciences. Some of the reasons why women do not have the same opportunities to achieve career pathways equal to those of men are discussed. We conclude that there is an ongoing need to design and apply new policies to effect a gender balance throughout the career path. This is seen not simply as an equitable outcome - it is a moral imperative."
"‘Like pouring fuel on a fire’: Perspectives on family and domestic violence among Ethiopian women in Melbourne Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Help-Seeking In this article, we analyse how domestic violence (DV) is understood and experienced among immigrant Ethiopian women in Melbourne, as well as the different conditions that contribute to their experiences of abuse and their responses to it. To do this, we draw on 20 interviews with participants, 7 of whom experienced intimate partner violence. Demonstrating that immigrant Ethiopian women find themselves in a social context with a set of values and understandings of family and DV that differs from their own, we argue that their responses to DV shows their selective acceptance of these values and state interventions. In exploring these themes, we contribute to the discussion about minority women's voices, values and priorities in relation to violence in the migration context. Our findings also highlight the limitations of mainstream approaches to DV, illustrating the extent to which interventions are constructed through reference to western perceptions of individuality and white feminism."
"A temporal assessment of microplastics distribution on the beaches of three remote islands of the Yasawa archipelago, Fiji Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter This is the first study that investigated the presence, distribution, and composition of microplastics, MPs (1-5 mm) on beaches in the Yasawa Islands, Fiji. A temporal assessment over three years on six beaches was undertaken to investigate different beach traits on MP abundance. Average MP concentration was 4.5 Â± 11.1 MPsÂ·mâˆ’2 with significantly higher concentrations were found on east-facing beaches than west (p < 0.001), and higher on the storm line compared to the high tide line (p < 0.001). No difference was found between tourist and local beaches (p = 0.21). These results demonstrate the role of current-driven ocean transport of plastic pollution in this part of The South Pacific. ATR FT-IR analysis showed that across all sites 34 % of MPs were polypropylene (PP), 33 % polystyrene (PS), 25 % polyethylene (PE), and 8 % other polymer types. Further studies are needed to assess the potential impacts of MPs on Fiji's coral reefs and marine life."
"Health promotion at the workplace setting: A protocol for a systematic review of effectiveness and sustainability of current practice in low-income and middle-income countries Presenteeism; Health Promotion; Workplace Introduction Low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are experiencing a growing disease burden due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Changing behavioural practices, such as diets high in saturated fat, salt and sugar and sedentary lifestyles, have been associated with the increase in NCDs. Health promotion at the workplace setting is considered effective in the fight against NCDs and has been reported to yield numerous benefits. However, there is a need to generate evidence on the effectiveness and sustainability of workplace health promotion practice specific to LMICs. We aim to synthesise the current literature on workplace health promotion in LMICs focusing on interventions effectiveness and sustainability. Methods and analysis We will conduct a systematic review of published studies from LMICs up to 31 March 2019. We will search the following databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest and CINAHL. Two reviewers will independently screen potential articles for inclusion and disagreements will be resolved by consensus. We will appraise the quality and risk of bias of included studies using two tools from the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. We will present a narrative overview and assessment of the body of evidence derived from the comprehensive review of the studies. The reported outcomes will be summarised by study design, duration, intensity/frequency of intervention delivery and by the six-priority health promotion action areas set out in the Ottawa Charter. We will conduct a thematic analysis to identify the focus areas of current interventions. This systematic review protocol has been prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta- analyses for Protocols 2015 statement. Ethics and dissemination This study does not require ethics approval. We will disseminate the results of this review through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. Trial registration number CRD42018110853."
"BIM-based performance monitoring for smart building management Information Modeling; Facilities Management; Construction Industry Purpose: Effective use of post-occupancy evaluation (POE) data â€“ quantitative physical measurements and qualitative occupantsâ€™ perceptions are limited due to practical challenges and research gaps. Although building information modelling (BIM) has enabled a paradigm shift in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries, its use in facility management (FM) is still infancy. Limited research has used building performance data to enable changes to BIM models for the benefit of FM. This paper aims to propose the innovative process to collect and contextualize two fragmented types of POE data sets by filling methodological gap in POE research. Moreover, it presents innovative modelling techniques to facilitate BIM as a more effective platform to visualize such currently fragmented data sets in real-time while enabling a decision-making model to benefit facility managers. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a process of capturing cloud-based POE data, both wireless sensor network-based physical measurement data and mobile app-based occupant perception data. Real-time capture and visualization of such building performance data was demonstrated through a pilot data collection. Subsequently, the innovative visualization of the cloud connected data is supported by a prototype game engine-based BIM model. Findings: Cloud-based POE data, both quantitative physical measurements and qualitative occupantsâ€™ reported perceptions, can be effectively used in FM practice with the use of innovative data capture and visualization techniques in a beneficial manner for facility operation and management decisions. This paper also demonstrates the ability of BIM to serve as a â€œsingle source of truthâ€ to support post-construction building performance data. Originality/value: While addressing a number of research gaps, the paper provides a holistic approach to BIM-based performance monitoring for smart FM to achieve the ultimate vision of BIM enabled FM. The innovative system is expected to provide a powerful and practical tool for data collection, analysis and visualization for intelligent facility management decision making. This paper contributes to fill an important research and practice gap in the area of next generation smart building management practices."
"Caliciopsis pleomorpha sp. nov. (Ascomycota: Coryneliales) causing a severe canker disease of Eucalyptus cladocalyx and other eucalypt species in Australia Fungi; Chrysoporthe; Stem Cankers Caliciopsis pleomorpha sp. nov. is described from a severe stem canker disease of cultivated Eucalyptus cladocalyx 'Nana' (dwarf sugar gum) in Australia. The fungus is a pleomorphic ascomycete (Coryneliales), with pycnidial (pleurophomalike) and hyphomycetous (phaeoacremonium-like) morphs, and differs in these respects and in ITS sequences from other Caliciopsis spp. The fungus was also found associated with cankers on other Eucalyptus species growing in native habitats, and was successfully inoculated under glasshouse conditions into a wide range of Eucalyptus species on which it caused cankers of varying severity."
"Stochastic convergence in per capita CO2 emissions: Evidence from emerging economies, 1921–2014 Income Convergence; Structural Funds; European Union We employ the recently developed LM and RALS-LM unit root tests that allow for endogenously determined structural breaks to study stochastic convergence in relative per capita CO2 emissions over the period 1921 to 2014 for a balanced panel of emerging market economies. The results provide mixed evidence of the presence of stochastic convergence. In particular, stochastic convergence is achieved for eleven out of the seventeen countries under investigation. This implies that the energy regulatory framework in these countries needs to be revaluated in order to reduce the carbon footprint. To further comprehend the factors behind the observed disparities in emission stability, we analyse the determinants of the identified groups. An examination of the determinants of the observed behaviour in relative per capita CO2 emissions reveal that income, population, financial development and trade are significant drivers, with trade predominantly playing a larger role in emission growth. Also, weak evidence is found in terms of a catching-up effect in the growth of relative per capita CO2 emissions."
" An overview on dry low NO x micromix combustor development for hydrogen-rich gas turbine applications  Combustion Chambers; Gas Turbines; Hydrogen The paper presents a survey of the interactive optimization cycle at Aachen University of Applied Sciences, used for the development of a new low emission Micromix combustor module for application in hydrogen fueled industrial gas turbines. During the development process, experimental and numerical methods are applied to optimize a given baseline combustor with 0.3 mm nozzles with respect to combustion efficiency, combustion stability, higher thermal power output per nozzle and reduced manufacturing complexity. Within the described research cycle combustion and flow simulations are used in the context of parametric studies for generating optimized burner geometries and the phenomenological interpretation of the experimental results. Experimental tests, carried out on an atmospheric combustion chamber test stand provide the basis for validation of simulation results and proof of the predicted combustion characteristics under scaled down gas turbine conditions. In the presented studies, an integration-optimized Micromix combustor with a nozzle diameter of 0.84 mm is tested at atmospheric pressure over a range of gas turbine operating conditions with hydrogen fuel. The combustor module offers an increase in the thermal power output per nozzle by approx. 390% at a significant reduced number of injectors when compared to the baseline design. This greatly benefits manufacturing complexity and the robustness of the combustion process against fuel contamination by particles. During atmospheric testing, the optimized combustor module shows satisfactory operating behavior, combustion efficiency and pollutant emission level. Within the evaluated operating range, which correlates to gas turbine part-, full- and overload conditions, the investigated combustor module exceeds 99% combustion efficiency. The Micromix combustor achieves NO x emissions less than 2.5 ppm corrected to 15 Vol% O 2 at the design point. Based on numerical analyses and experimental low pressure testing, a full-scale gas turbine combustion chamber is derived. High pressure testing in the auxiliary power unit Honeywell/Garrett GTCP 36â€“300 shows stable operation during acceleration of the engine, during IDLE and during load variations between IDLE and Main Engine Start (MES) mode. Throughout the investigated operating range, the combustion chamber generates low NO x emissions under full-scale gas turbine conditions."
"Long-range ordered TiO2/Au hollow urchins: topology control for maskless electrodeposition Raman Spectroscopy; 4-Aminothiophenol; Plasmonics We present a novel approach for fabricating multicomponent ordered nanostructures using colloidal lithography and electrodeposition techniques, enabling maskless, targeted and uniform material deposition. As an example of the capability of our approach to develop low-cost ordered complex structures, we fabricated long-range ordered crystals (LROCs) of titania/gold urchins. The fabrication process involved four steps: (i) development of non-close-packed polystyrene monolayer templates; (ii) fabrication of supporting titania micro-shells via chemical vapor deposition on the templates; (iii) evaporation of a thin film of gold to form a conductive layer, and (iv) electrodeposition of a secondary component, gold nano-spikes, localized on each colloid in the LROC. We demonstrated that the electrodeposition can be localized on 200 nm thick micro-shell nanostructures, and the size of gold nano-spikes can be controlled in length between 100 nm and 1.5 Î¼m. This length control leads to a versatile class of composite materials where an underlying micro-shell structure, titania in this example, and electrodeposited nanostructures, gold nano-spikes, have direct access to the surrounding medium. This novel method provides both self-cleaning and sensing multifunctionalities with high repeatability and control due to the long-range uniformity of the structures created. This journal is"
"Household coping behavior and its contribution to resilience to global macroeconomic shocks in Vanuatu and Solomon Islands Climate Change; Decision to Migrate; Small Islands This paper examines the resilience of households in Vanuatu and Solomon Islandsâ€”two small island developing states in Melanesia renowned for their vulnerabilitiesâ€”to the adverse effects of global macroeconomic shocks. The focus is on the spike in international food and fuel prices in 2008 and the subsequent shock to global demand, known as the Global Economic Crisis (GEC). Using a unique retrospective cross-section survey, the results show that experience of these shocks was widespread across urban and rural areas. Households with more education, access to income-generating activitiesâ€”particularly in the informal sectorâ€”and greater wealth were best placed to withstand a deterioration in their well-being, measured as a fall in self-reported disposable income. Households also employed a variety of coping strategies in response to the shocks. Local food gardens and informal insurance are seen as key safety nets in times of stress, yet neither provided full insurance from the shocks. Some households, particularly in urban areas, employed harmful coping strategies, such as reducing spending on health, education, and food. While potentially effective in withstanding a temporary fall in disposable income, these responses are likely to weaken overall resilience and leave households vulnerable to future shocks."
Stock price movements: Evidence from global equity markets Equity Premium; Stock Returns; Excess Returns This paper studies how market-level stock price movements respond to changes in expected future aggregate cashflows versus discount rates in individual global equity markets. We find that market-level dividend yields have strong forecasting power for aggregate dividend growth over a short term in most stock markets but their forecasting power becomes weak with investment horizon; their forecasting power for returns tends to exhibit an opposite pattern. The variance decomposition of dividend yields exhibits interesting cross-country heterogeneity. We further find that dividend smoothing and country-level disclosure and investor protection are two important drivers of the diverse predictability patterns across countries.
"Economic development, cargo handling methods and labour process change: the place of the Vietnamese dock worker in the ‘global’ history of dock work Container Terminal; Oral Testimony; Shipyard Worker The advent of containerised cargo completely revolutionised shipping and world trade, also transforming the way that dock workers did their jobs. As a result, the docks are one of the most academically scrutinised industries. However, much of the research in this stream is limited to developed countries. Just as the economies of South East Asia are expanding rapidly and gaining increased attention, so more emphasis needs to be placed on the way economic growth and modernisation affect management, employment and administration of key industries in these countries. To these ends, this article will explore the modernisation of the Vietnamese dock industry and examine whether workers there have experienced similar challenges as their counterparts elsewhere, despite the countryâ€™s very different path and timing of economic development."
"Evapotranspiration and biogeochemical regulation in a mountain peatland: insights from eddy covariance and ionic balance measurements Eddy Covariance; Net Ecosystem Exchange; Ecosystem Study Region: The mountainous catchments in the Australian Alps are one of the highest water-yielding regions within a generally dry continent. Peatlands are critical water-regulating components of these catchments, and their response to a changing climate will impact all downstream environments and water availability for human uses. Study Focus: Mountain peatland ecohydrology, and in particular the role of evapotranspiration, remains incompletely understood. This study focused on evapotranspiration and biogeochemical regulation of â€œAlpine Sphagnum Bogsâ€, with a case study at Watchbed Creek peatland. Eddy covariance was used to quantify evapotranspiration and combined with Penman-Monteith-based evapotranspiration to calculate an â€˜ecosystem vegetation coefficientâ€™ (KESV). Base-flow evapotranspiration and analyses of Clâˆ’, Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in peatland stream water were used to assess biogeochemical processes. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: This work demonstrates that evapotranspiration is a major component of the water budget, 26% of annual precipitation. Further, we show how KESV calculated from direct measurements at one site may enable evapotranspiration to be modelled for other mountain catchments. The seasonally dependent nature of the biogeochemical regulation processes observed in this mountain peatland can be used as a reference to evaluate the condition of peatlands under similar synoptic weather conditions. In practice, this means that mountain ecosystem restoration can now be informed by a better understanding of the ecohydrology of these critical high mountain catchments."
"Complexities in mega rail transportation projects: “Sydney metro” and “Melbourne metro rail” insight Timetabling; Rescheduling; Line Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to initially evaluate the most current and important complications of sustainable mega rail transportation projects. This purpose is assisted by thoroughly reviewing the foremost uncertainties and challenging issues of STI. Once these factors are established, they will be the base of STI indicators. Finally, to consolidate such alignment, the Sydney Metro and Melbourne Metro are then compared and analyzed. The analysis would then create a platform to measure sustainability and relevant complexities in mega rail transportation projects. Design/methodology/approach: To further consolidate such hypothesis, this research investigated two mega rail transportation projects in Australia. Both Sydney Metro and Melbourne Metro Rail were selected as the basis of case study, as both possess similar sustainability aspects. Findings: As an outcome this research found that, complexities in both of these projects were based on future challenges and opportunities including imperfect equalization or not balancing all the four sustainability indicators; and where and how to emphasize the overlapping of these four indicators. In summary, these findings can assist the relevant planners, to better prepare and manage mega railway infrastructure and their operations. Originality/value: While the sustainability for transportation infrastructure has been covered extensively by other authors, this paper strengthens the four specific and separate STI indicators â€“ especially for mega rail infrastructure. Although, there are some crossover areas within these indicators, however, this research separately validates each as an independent entity. Commonly, there are three dimensions within the sustainability domain â€“ environmental, economical and social. Nevertheless, for this research, a fourth dimension engineering which includes all the technical focus, has been separately developed. This is particularly important to effectively deal with all the complexities, particularly for mega projects, such as rail transportation infrastructure. Accordingly, separating the engineering dimension would thus reshape the triple bottom line factors to include a separate technical focus. To further evaluate this separation of the four specific areas, two mega Australian rail transportation projects are then reviewed as experiments."
"Efficient Simulation Method for First Passage Problem of Linear Systems Subjected to Non-Gaussian Excitations Structural Reliability; Monte Carlo Method; Normal Space This paper addresses the first passage problem of linear systems subjected to non-Gaussian excitations by means of simulation. A non-Gaussian simulation technique based on the unified Hermite polynomial model (UHPM) is adopted to model input excitations, and then the output responses are further obtained through time-domain analysis. The novel contribution of this paper is to construct an efficient importance sampling (IS) density function based on UHPM and the first-order reliability method (FORM) to release the computational burden. A simple and efficient sampling procedure is also provided for convenient implementation. Such an approach allows the failure probabilities in the order of 10-3 or lower to be estimated reliably with a reduced computational cost. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by three examples, including a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator, a 3-story linear shear frame, and a relatively large-scale finite-element model."
"Public-private partnerships in municipal Wi-fi: Optimising public value Local Loop Unbundling; Access Price; Broadband Public-private partnerships (PPP) are the dominant business model for procuring and operating public digital communication networks such as public Wi-Fi and IoT, technologies that play a significant role in providing public internet access and managing urban systems. e literature on partnerships in public infrastructure provision gives much aention to risk in such arrangements, and is largely sceptical of the capacity of public authorities to transfer risk to the private sector. In the limited critical discussion of PPPs or similar arrangements in the field of communications infrastructure, technological capture or lock-in of city governments investing in digital communications networks is hypothesised as a risk factor. In this paper I draw on field research to investigate this hypothesis by analysing risk factors associated with PPP models in the provision of municipal-level public Wi-Fi. Focussing on Australian examples, I argue that the limited expertise and resources of local government authorities (LGAs), along with the regulatory complexity of telecommunications, weigh against direct LGA provision of public Wi-Fi and in favour of partnership arrangements. However, I highlight two concerns associated with PPP models of public WiFi provision: 1) the lack of transparency and accountability relating to digital infrastructure procurement and service evaluation imposed by commercial-in-confidence claims, and 2) the limited aention of LGAs to questions of data access when contracting private providers, subsequently limiting their capacity to obtain and use network metadata for public good purposes. Drawing on the work of Mark H Moore, I frame these concerns as strategic management challenges. Moore's analysis of these challenges through his strategic triangle model assists in optimising the public value of PPP arrangements in the domain of digital infrastructure. While I focus on PWF networks, the discussion has wider relevance for e-governance."

"A Generalized Framework for Measuring Pedestrian Accessibility around the World Using Open Data Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Pedestrian accessibility is an important factor in urban transport and land use policy and critical for creating healthy, sustainable cities. Developing and evaluating indicators measuring inequalities in pedestrian accessibility can help planners and policymakers benchmark and monitor the progress of city planning interventions. However, measuring and assessing indicators of urban design and transport features at high resolution worldwide to enable city comparisons is challenging due to limited availability of official, high-quality, and comparable spatial data, as well as spatial analysis tools offering customizable frameworks for indicator construction and analysis. To address these challenges, this study develops an open source software framework to construct pedestrian accessibility indicators for cities using open and consistent data. It presents a generalized method to consistently measure pedestrian accessibility at high resolution and spatially aggregated scale, to allow for both within- and between-city analyses. The open source and open data methods developed in this study can be extended to other cities worldwide to support local planning and policymaking. The software is made publicly available for reuse in an open repository."
"Government reform, regulatory change and carbon disclosure: Evidence from Australia Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative This paper examines the effect of two Australian environmental regulatory changes, specifically the Clean Energy Act (CEA) 2011 and the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) Act 2007 with reference to voluntary corporate carbon disclosure practices. In doing so, it describes the brief history of this carbon-related regulatory change, its scope, enforcement criteria and corporationsâ€™ disclosures. This is a longitudinal analysis of 219 annual reports of 73 listed corporations in Australia which were subjected to carbon tax and report carbon emissions as per the CEA 2011 and NGER Act 2007 accordingly. Any corporation or facility that emitted scope 1 emissions of 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) or more were liable for a carbon tax in accordance with CEA 2011. Drawing on stakeholder theory and legitimacy theory, this study uses content analysis to examine corporate carbon disclosure. The findings suggest there is a considerable increase in the number of carbon-related disclosures following these regulations being enacted as law. In addition, carbon-specific communication has become much more prevalent and accounts for a larger proportion of the sampled organisationsâ€™ reported environmental information. The results of this study enrich the validity of the hypothesis that organisations would seek to legitimise their operations to stakeholders by increasing their environment-related declarations. The evidence presented in the analysis confirms the assertion that government environmental legislation/regulation has a positive impact on corporate behaviour and accountability. These findings have significant consequences for the government, decision-makers and the accounting profession, indicating that regulatory guidance enhances both mandatory and voluntary disclosure. It also offers key insights into the possible impacts of the carbon regulatory change for future research to consider."
"Skilled labour shortage: a qualitative study of Ghana’s training and apprenticeship system Apprenticeship Training; Firm; Human Capital Theory The impacts of training and apprenticeship education towards building high-level technical and vocational skills that support human capital development and attracting foreign direct investment are being reshaped by global competition. This article draws on human capital theory to report on a qualitative study that explores skilled labour challenges within Ghanaâ€™s training and apprenticeship system through the lens of the demand side of employment perspective. The findings point to a training mismatch, lack of regulations and ineffective apprenticeship programmes, underinvestment in education and training, and outdated training programmes. The bottlenecks in the supply of skilled labour in Ghana are hampering the firmsâ€™ ability to find skilled labour across industries. We suggest improved social partnership between industries and training institutions, with increased government investment in training and apprenticeship programmes, as a way forward to address the technical and vocational skilled labour supply bottlenecks. Wider implications for the African region which shares similar developing contexts are discussed."
"Decent work for sustainable development in post-crisis Nepal: Social policy challenges and a way forward Welfare Regimes; Public Policy; Nepal Although the Decent Work agenda has received significant attention in the context of sustainable development, the formulation and implementation of appropriate social policies in developing countries remain an underexplored subject. This article responds to this gap and traces country-specific Decent Work related policies and programs in Nepalâ€”which is recovering from two major crises: a decade-long armed conflict that ended in 2006 as well as the 2015 earthquake. Drawing on Critical Policy Analysis framework, this article examines how key tenets of the International Labour Organisation's Decent Work platform, namely creation and provision of employment, social protection, social dialogue and rights at work have manifested in Nepal. The findings indicate that while attempts have been made to embrace the Decent Work agenda into social policies and programs, structural instability of political processes means that there is a lack of strategic directions to address a capacity deficit specific to the informal sector and outbound labour migrants. The article makes broader analytical contributions towards evaluating the implementation of social policies driven by the global priority in the context of developing nations with weak governance settings. In countries like Nepal, where the majority of workers are located within the informal sector and as such the administrative reach and effectiveness of Decent Work related social policies designed for the formal sector are limited."
"Selective extraction of polar lipids of mango kernel using Supercritical Carbon dioxide (SC–CO2) extraction: Process optimization of extract yield/phosphorous content and economic evaluation Antioxidant; Mangoes; Mangifera Indica Extract Lipids are biomolecules extracted from plant sources and plant residues and have a beneficial role in various food, nutrition and medical applications. Supercritical carbon-dioxide as an advanced high-pressure technology which increases the productivity and has negligible environmental impact is employed for the selective extraction of polar lipids from the lipid matrix in mango kernel for the first time. The process parameters affecting the extraction such as pressure, temperature and the flow rate of CO2 are ranged in the intervals of 30â€“50 MPa, 40â€“60 Â°C and 10â€“30 g min-1, respectively. Optimization using Box Behnken design obtained the highest yield of 3.38% at 40 Â°C, 50 MPa and 30 g min-1. The phosphorous content was evaluated to understand the behaviour of polar lipids extraction at higher pressures. The study showed the effect of process parameters having significant influence on polarity and solvating capacity of CO2 which enabled for the extraction of polar lipids adding value to the mango kernel converting waste into valuable industrial products. The economic evaluation estimates the return on investment of a plant processing 3000 tons of mango kernel per year to account net present value (NPV) almost five times higher than the investment expenses and the payback period is under 4 years."
"Smells like politics: planning and the inconvenient politics of intensive peri-urban agriculture Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems Intensive farming is an increasing part of Australian agriculture, including in the multi-functional landscapes at the edges of Australian cities. The example of intensive â€œbroilerâ€ poultry production reveals the tensions that arise when sites of hyper-productivity conflict with social change in rural areas. Planning processes for intensive farming in the Australian state of Victoria are predicated on stability and consensus: on assumed static and uncontroversial ideas of agriculture, its place, and the primacy of agricultural productivity. Yet concerns about the industrialisation of agriculture are live political issues at the local level, especially in dynamic peri-urban locations. This paper explores the emergence of a politics of place outside the bounds of planning consensus through an analysis of planning appeals and associated media relating to planning permits for intensive poultry developments in Victoria over 2011â€“2016. We highlight tensions that exist in relation to technical planning assessments and categorisations used to assert farming as the orthodox use of rural land, especially when new forms of farming look and feel demonstrably different. Using Mouffe's problematising of the negation of antagonism and RanciÃ¨re's notion of the risks of a false consensus democracy, we argue that planning processes for intensive farming illustrate critical issues in participatory planning. While ostensibly post-political decision-making narrows the politics of place and food systems to decisions about policing the boundaries and buffer distances placed around intensive poultry developments, alternative representations of rural life persist. The certainty offered by code-based planning does not negate the ongoing (if inconvenient) politics of intensive peri-urban agriculture."
"Reporting of Corporate Social Responsibility in Central Public Sector Enterprises: A Study of Post Mandatory Regime in India Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative This paper explores the level of corporate social responsibility (CSR) contributions disclosed by central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) in India. This paper analyses the nature and quality of CSR disclosures (CSRDs) made by CPSEs listed in India following the issue of CSR guidelines by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) for CPSEs in March 2010. The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of CSR guidelines on the reporting practices of the CPSEs. A content analysis of annual reports across seven themes shows that Human Resources (HR) and Community Development are the prime focus areas of CSR disclosures, whereas Carbon and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are the least reported activity. The disclosures across all CSR themes are primarily narrative rather than quantitative or in monetary terms. The findings of the study may help policy makers in India to assess practices and devise detailed and specific CSRD requirements, rather than the current general mandatory requirements, to enhance the performance and quality of CSRDs by the CPSEs."
"Bamboo as an alternative bioenergy crop and powerful ally for land restoration in Indonesia Culms; Phyllostachys Edulis; Plantation The energy demand in Indonesia has increased significantly with its population growth, urbanization, and economic development. The growing concern of meeting energy demand while reducing dependency on fossil fuels has resulted in an increasing demand for renewable energy. As a country with a rich biomass base, bioenergy is now an important component of Indonesia's energy agenda. However, a crucial problem in bioenergy production is the selection of species that can provide a sustainable supply of feedstock without having an impact on food security and the environment. In this context, we discuss the characteristics and benefits of using bamboo, a perennial grass, as a potential species for bioenergy feedstock in Indonesia. We describe the fuel characteristics of bamboo along with the possibility to align its cultivation, production, and usage with environmental and developmental agendas which makes it a suitable bioenergy crop in the country. In addition, its ability to grow on degraded lands, fast growth, long root system, and easy maintenance prove it as a powerful ally for the restoration of degraded land. We recommend in-depth research on the social, ecological, and economic feasibility of using this species for bioenergy production."
"Breakdowns in inter-organisational information sharing: The case of major incidents in Bangladesh Activity Theory; Psychological Practice; Self-Confrontation This study investigates breakdowns in information sharing among different actors involved in responding to major incidents such as police, fire, local government and NGOs. While previous studies on inter-organisational information sharing and collaboration in a disaster context have largely been undertaken in Europe, Australia and the USA; this study will focus on a developing country, Bangladesh, which faces both organisational and institutional challenges alongside a projected increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather-related disasters. The study adopts a qualitative case study approach of multiple organisations comprising observation, interviews and document analysis. Activity theory informs the study. A major contribution of this research will be a better understanding of how actors share information during major incidents and how the arising contradictions are resolved in practice. Theoretically, it will outline the contradictions in inter-organisational information sharing and how actors mitigate these contradictions during major incidents."
"Losing the authority–what institutional architecture for cooperative governance in the Murray Darling Basin? Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Water governance strongly depends on the institutional arrangements in place. The plethora of recent inquiries into the adequacy and integrity of governance arrangements in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) indicates a crisis of trust, legitimacy and public confidenceâ€“in short, a loss of authority. With the prospect that current arrangements are losing the authority and legitimacy needed to govern the Basin, pressure is mounting for further reforms due to scandals exposed in the media throughout 2017 and 2018. These and subsequent inquiries have revealed serious concerns about probity, integrity, maladministration and the adequacy of compliance and enforcement regimes. The productive potential of this crisis is that draws attention to the need for reforms to governance institutions. This paper aims to explore the redesign of the institutional architecture in the MDB. Given the profound challenges of social and climate change that are demanding reconsideration of the underlying models used in adaptively governing large complex socio-ecological systems, the paper asks what arrangements are suited to the challenges of governing the Basin in the 21st century? This paper explores the nature of the redesign challenge, exploring principles, practices and features of MDB governance. The need for institutions with capacity for strategic navigation, goal seeking and the cultural co-construction of authority are suggested in the interests of cultivating debate about prospective reorganisation."
"Exploration of the utility of the Nursing Process and the Clinical Reasoning Cycle as a framework for forensic mental health nurses: A qualitative study Nurses; Prisons; Forensic Mental Health Forensic mental health nursing (FMHN) is a specialized field, designed to meet the needs of people who have a serious mental illness across the criminal justice system, inpatient services and community. Frameworks can assist assessment, planning, intervention, documentation and evaluation of nursing care. However, there is no prior research investigating frameworks in FMHN. This study aimed to explore the Nursing Process (NP) and the Clinical Reasoning Cycle (CRC), with nurses, to determine a suitable framework for use service-wide. A Nominal Group Technique was used to facilitate exploration of the two frameworks, where open-ended verbal and written responses collected from a Nominal Group were thematically analysed, and the participants voted on their preferred framework. Seventeen nurses from a state-wide forensic mental health (FMH) service participated. The four main themes were as follows: challenges to current practice, limitations of the NP, perceived benefits of the CRC and addressing implementation. Consensus was reached with the nurses selecting the CRC as the framework of choice. This is the first study to explore frameworks to guide practice in FMHN. Nurses in this study considered the CRC to be a suitable framework for novice through to expert, offering a contemporary framework to guide nursing care in complex FMH settings. Some adjustments to the existing cycle were suggested to emphasize recovery-oriented practice, and inclusion of family and carers. Any changes to the cycle warrant exploration with the interdisciplinary team and consumer carer workforce."

"Ecocentric leadership and voluntary environmental behavior for promoting sustainability strategy: The role of psychological green climate Sustainability; Environmental Management Systems; Eco-Management and Audit Scheme Sustainability is not just a â€œbuzzwordâ€ but refers to the ideal business strategy for encouraging sustainable behavior for remaining relevant and competitive. Managers of organizations are increasingly expected to duly consider and demonstrate the desired social and environmental intentions of translating leadership strategies into sustainable practices. Studies on employees' voluntary environmental behavior (VEB) are increasing in number, in that it is believed that behavior can contribute to achieving organizational sustainability strategy. However, despite the studies being published on this emerging field, leadership is a missing link regarding the psychological mechanism through which VEB can be defined and refined. Drawing on the theories of social learning and social exchange, this study seeks to establish the impact of ecocentric leadership (EL) on VEB and the mediating role of psychological green climate (PGC) in this nexus. Data were collected from wide-ranging business organizations in Bangladesh through a self-administered survey questionnaire. The results indicate that EL wields a significant direct influence on VEB. Moreover, EL through the mediating effect of PGC indirectly shapes VEB. The study contributes original insights to the discussions and debates on strategic leadership and climate accountability. Implications of ecocentric strategic leadership and recommendations for future research are discussed."
"If not quality, then what? The discursive risks in early childhood quality reform Early Childhood Education and Care; Nursery Schools; Preschool Education This paper reports on the findings of a genealogical study and argues that the global discourse of quality in early childhood education and care (ECEC) is based on a number of problematic assumptions that converge to identify â€˜qualityâ€™ as the site of government investment. Using the Australian policy context as an example, the assumption that only quality ECEC is beneficial for children is linked to the historical privileging of mother-care and the male breadwinner through family policy. Using Foucaultâ€™s notion of the â€˜art of governmentâ€™, the implications of the discursive logics of quality are outlined, including how â€˜not qualityâ€™ childcare is positioned as potentially harmful, yet, the workforce can never be â€˜quality enoughâ€™. It is recommended that early childhood sector academics, advocates and professionals work to introduce new discursive statements to the global policyscape, in order to create and foster diverse representations and understandings of the benefits and value of ECEC."
"Our home is girt by seawalls? Preserving the public interest in an era of sea level rise Flood Risk; Flood Risk Management; Community Rating In this article we interview planners from local government authorities in Western Australia who are responsible for preparing coastal communities for the likely effects of sea level rise, to identify the preferences of these planners regarding the regulation of new coastal protection structures. We then examine how these preferences are likely to influence the achievement of the State coastal policyâ€™s public interest objectives. The article demonstrates that these planners have a clear preference against the long-term stabilisation of shorelines using hard structures, which aligns with the preferences outlined in the State policy. However, paradoxically, the current legislative and funding framework tends to encourage the continued adoption of protection measures to stabilise existing shoreline positions in order to maintain public beach amenity. In an era of sea level rise, this approach is likely to become increasingly unviable and undermine the achievement of State objectives. Recommendations are provided to help Western Australia achieve its public interest objectives."
"Are sterols useful for the identification of sources of faecal contamination in shellfish? A case study Cholestanols; Organic Matter; Sterols This work aimed to identify the major source(s) of faecal pollution impacting Salcott Creek oyster fisheries in the UK through the examination of the sterol profiles. The concentration of the major sewage biomarker, coprostanol, in water overlying the oysters varied between 0.01 Î¼g Lâˆ’1 and 1.20 Î¼g Lâˆ’1. The coprostanol/epicoprostanol ratio ranged from 1.32 (September) to 33.25 (February), suggesting that human sewage represents the key input of faecal material into the estuary. However, a correlation between the sterol profile of water above the oysters with that of water that enters from Tiptree Sewage Treatment Works (r = 0.82), and a sample from a site (Quinces Corner) observed to have a high population of Brent geese (r = 0.82), suggests that both sources contribute to the faecal pollution affecting the oysters. In identifying these key faecal inputs, sterol profiling has allowed targeted management practices to be employed to ensure that oyster quality is optimised."
"Intelligent Driver Assistance and Energy Management Systems of Hybrid Electric Autonomous Vehicles Adaptive Cruise Control; Connected Vehicles; Controller Automotive companies continue to develop integrated safety, sustainability, and reliability features that can help mitigate some of the most common driving risks associated with autonomous vehicles (AVs). Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) offer practical solutions to use control strategies to cut down fuel usage and emissions. AVs and HEVs are combined to take the advantages of each kind to solve the problem of wasting energy. This paper presents an intelligent driver assistance system, including adaptive cruise control (ACC) and an energy management system (EMS), for HEVs. Our proposed ACC determines the desired acceleration and safe distance with the lead car through a switched model predictive control (MPC) and a neuro-fuzzy (NF) system. The performance criteria of the switched MPC toggles between speed and distance control appropriately and its stability is mathematically proven. The EMS intelligently control the energy consumption based on ACC commands. The results show that the driving risk is extremely reduced by using ACC-MPC and ACC-NF, and the vehicle energy consumption by driver assistance system based on ACC-NF is improved by 2.6%."
"Carbon Dot Therapeutic Platforms: Administration, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity, and Therapeutic Potential Fluorescence; Nanodots; Carbon Nanoparticles Ultrasmall nanoparticles are often grouped under the broad umbrella term of â€œnanoparticlesâ€ when reported in the literature. However, for biomedical applications, their small sizes give them intimate interactions with biological species and endow them with unique functional physiochemical properties. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are an emerging class of ultrasmall nanoparticles which have demonstrated considerable biocompatibility and have been employed as potent theragnostic platforms. These particles find application for increasing drug solubility and targeting, along with facilitating the passage of drugs across impermeable membranes (i.e., blood brain barrier). Further functionality can be triggered by various environmental conditions or external stimuli (i.e., pH, temperature, near Infrared (NIR) light, ultrasound), and their intrinsic fluorescence is valuable for diagnostic applications. The focus of this review is to shed light on the therapeutic potential of CQDs and identify how they travel through the body, reach their site of action, administer therapeutic effect, and are excreted. Investigation into their toxicity and compatibility with larger nanoparticle carriers is also examined. The future of CQDs for theragnostic applications is promising due to their multifunctional attributes and documented biocompatibility. As nanomaterial platforms become more commonplace in clinical treatments, the commercialization of CQD therapeutics is anticipated."
"Research on agricultural cooperation potential between china and cee countries based on resource complementarity Alliance Portfolios; Firm; Open Innovation Central and East European (CEE) countries are attractive among emerging markets due to a combination of factors such as economic growth and market potential. Although the CEE countries as a whole have a very high degree of connectivity, each country has different market opportunities and external environment, so agricultural enterprises wanting to enter the CEE market must take into account the diverse and complex resource base of CEE countries. In the light of economic globalization, China and CEE countries face mutual opportunities and challenges, and it is necessary to strengthen agricultural cooperation. The potential of agricultural investment cooperation between China and CEE countries is the basis for multinational enterprises to allocate resources and implement internationalization strategies rationally. The purpose of this paper is to analyze theagricultural cooperation potential between China and CEE countries in the perspective of resource complementarity, with a selection of macro data related to agricultural capacity from 2009â€“2018. In particular, this study examines the differences and complementarities between China and CEE countries in terms of agricultural resource conditions and product output and trade; by constructing an agricultural cooperation potential evaluation model, the entropy value method is applied to predict and evaluate the potential characteristics of agricultural cooperation between China and CEE countries in 2021â€“2025. The research results show that the current intermittent and episodic nature of agricultural cooperation between China and CEE countries does not match the high or medium-high level of complementarity between agricultural production factors. Thus, agricultural enterprises can utiliza such considerable cooperation potential based on the resource complementarity to develop internationalization strategies and overseas investment."
"Evaluation of phytoremediation potential of five Cd (hyper)accumulators in two Cd contaminated soils Bioremediation; Noccaea Caerulescens; Arabidopsis Halleri A phytoextraction experiment with five Cd hyperaccumulators (Amaranthus hypochondriacus, Celosia argentea, Solanum nigrum, Phytolacca acinosa and Sedum plumbizincicola) was conducted in two soils with different soil pH (5.93 and 7.43, respectively). Most accumulator plants grew better in the acidic soil, with 19.59â€“39.63% higher biomass than in the alkaline soil, except for S. plumbizincicola. The potential for a metal-contaminated soil to be cleaned up using phytoremediation is determined by the metal uptake capacity of hyperaccumulator, soil properties, and mutual fitness of plant-soil relationships. In the acidic soil, C. argentea and A. hypochondriacus extracted the highest amount of Cd (1.03 mg potâˆ’1 and 0.92 mg potâˆ’1, respectively). In the alkaline soil, S. plumbizincicola performed best, mainly as a result of high Cd accumulation in plant tissue (541.36 mg kgâˆ’1). Most plants achieved leaf Cd bioconcentration factor (BCF) of >10 in the acidic soil, compared to <4 in the alkaline soil. Soil Cd availability was chiefly responsible for such contrasting metal extraction capacity, with 5.02% fraction and 48.50% fraction of total Cd being available in the alkaline and acidic soil, respectively. In the alkaline soil, plants tended to increase rhizosphere soil available Cd mainly through excreting more low molecular weight organic acids, not through changing the soil pH. In the acidic soil, plants slightly decreased soil available Cd. Those species which have high Ca, Zn, Fe uptake capacity extract more Cd from soil, and a positive correlation was found between the concentrations of Cd and Ca, Zn, Fe in leaves. Soil available Ca2+, Mg2+, SO4 2âˆ’, Clâˆ’ did not play a key role in Cd uptake by plants. In summary, acidic soil was of higher potential to recover from Cd contamination by phytoextraction, while in the alkaline soil, S. plumbizincicola showed potential for Cd phytoextraction."
"Microbial Degradation of Phenanthrene in Pristine and Contaminated Sandy Soils Bioremediation; Bioaugmentation; Contaminated Soil Phenanthrene mineralisation studies in both pristine and contaminated sandy soils were undertaken through detailed assessment of the activity and diversity of the microbial community. Stable isotope probing (SIP) was used to assess and identify active 13C-labelled phenanthrene degraders. Baseline profiling indicated that there was little difference in fungal diversity but a significant difference in bacterial diversity dependent on contamination history. Identification of dominant fungal and bacterial species highlighted the presence of organisms capable of degrading various petroleum-based compounds together with other anthropogenic compounds, regardless of contamination history. Community response following a simulated contamination event (14C-phenanthrene) showed that the microbial community in deep pristine and shallow contaminated soils adapted most to the presence of phenanthrene. The similarity in microbial community structure of well-adapted soils demonstrated that a highly adaptable fungal community in these soils enabled a rapid response to the introduction of a contaminant. Ten fungal and 15 bacterial species were identified as active degraders of phenanthrene. The fungal degraders were dominated by the phylum Basidiomycota including the genus Crypotococcus, Cladosporium and Tremellales. Bacterial degraders included the genera Alcanivorax, Marinobacter and Enterococcus. There was little synergy between dominant baseline microbes, predicted degraders and those that were determined to be actually degrading the contaminant. Overall, assessment of baseline microbial community in contaminated soils provides useful information; however, additional laboratory assessment of the microbial communityâ€™s ability to degrade pollutants allows for better prediction of the bioremediation potential of a soil."
"The Green School Award in Hong Kong: Development and Impact in the School Sector School Health Services; Well-Being; Health Promotion The Hong Kong Green School Award (HKGSA) is a school award scheme hosted by the Environmental Campaign Committee (ECC) to encourage schools to promote environmental awareness and for students to develop an environmentally-friendly lifestyle. Since its inception in 2000, the HKGSA has undergone several phases of development. Between 2000 to 2008 it took the form of a competition with 3 winning schools and 10 merit schools After an initial review in 2005, it was decided to change the 8th HKGSA from a competition format to a benchmarking process. The successfully accredited schools were given the title of Green School once they fulfilled certain requirements. Another major reform took place in the 12th HKGSA in 2013 to allow flexibility for schools to satisfy the requirements in phases by completing the accreditation to attain the gold award over a period of 3 years, the introduction of facilitators to act as mentors and the enforcing of a maximum validity period for the accreditation. This structure mirrored the sustainable schools program in Victoria, Australia. HKGSA has become a well-received accreditation scheme which can also act as a driving force to promote education for sustainable development in the school sector which in 2020 will be subsumed under the Hong Kong Awards for Environmental Excellence (HKAEE). This chapter describes the development of this initiative in Hong Kong, its framework, implementation, impact and future."
"RNA sequencing of leaf tissues from two contrasting chickpea genotypes reveals mechanisms for drought tolerance Cicer; Ascochyta; Genetic Variability Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the second most important winter crop which is consumed globally due to its high nutritional value. Chickpea as one of the leguminous crop is important in crop rotation with cereal crops like wheat and barley. The main constraints for chickpea production are abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and heat. Among these, drought is a major cause of the decline in chickpea production in worldwide. Studies conducted so far have provided a limited insight into different genetic pathways associated with drought tolerance/response. In this study, the leaf tissue from shoots apical meristem stage of drought tolerant (ICC8261) and drought sensitive (ICC283) genotypes were analysed using RNA sequencing to identify genes/pathways associated with drought tolerance/sensitivity in both genotypes. It was observed that genes related to ethylene response, MYB-related protein, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, alkane hydroxylase MAH-like, BON-1 associated, peroxidase 3, cysteine-rich and transmembrane domain, vignain and mitochondrial uncoupling were specifically up-regulated in the tolerant genotype whereas, same genes were down-regulated in sensitive genotype. The crosstalk between the different hormones and transcriptional factors involved in drought tolerance and sensitivity in both genotypes make them great candidates for future research."
"Mental Ill Health in Homeless Women: A Review Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease Research indicates that homeless women are reported to experience more mental health issues than women who are not homeless and are an increasing proportion of the overall homeless population. In addition, homeless women are more likely to have alcohol and/or other drug use disorders. We provide a comprehensive review of the contemporary literature that revealed homeless women experience a range of mental health problems including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol and other drug use disorders. Studies in this literature review indicate that some women have pre-existing mental health issues which precipitate homelessness while others develop mental illness because of their homelessness; domestic violence was also recognised as an antecedent to homelessness, although further research is needed in this area. The results of this study indicate that the homeless cohort is a complex one with distinct needs. We provide information that can help refine assessment processes and plan appropriate services to address the mental health needs of homeless women. Finally, recommendations for mental health nursing practice in regard to caring for homeless women are made."
"Impact of gas injection on physicochemical properties of waste activated sludge: A linear relationship between the change of viscoelastic properties and the change of other physiochemical properties Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling Aeration process in the waste activated sludge treatment accounts for 75% of total energy consumption of the treatment plant. The main purpose of the aeration process is to enhance the biodegradation of the liquid waste. Gas bubbles, rising through the liquid, improves mixing, reduces inhomogeneities in the treatment tank and enhances biological reactions. Thus aeration intensity and several physicochemical properties of feed such as viscosity, total suspended solids, and surface charge play a significant role in the biological reaction. This paper examines the impact of the gas injection rate on some physicochemical properties of waste activated sludge namely rheological properties, suspended solids, soluble COD (sCOD), surface tension, and zeta potential. The impact of four different gas flow rates on four different concentrations of waste activated sludge properties was analysed. The results showed that in linear viscoelastic regime the viscous and elastic modulus decreases linearly with an increase in gas flow rate. The amount of stress imposed by gas injection also showed a direct relationship with gas velocity. Gas injection also showed a substantial impact on soluble COD, suspended solids, and zeta potential. Additionally, a linear relationship was observed between the percentage change in the above mentioned physical properties and stress imposed by gas injection. These results confirm that gas injection produces additional shear impacting sludge physicochemical properties and therefore changes its rheological behaviour. The extra stress induced by gas injection can be predicted using a simple model based on sludge concentration and gas velocity."
"An experiment on the efficiency of bilateral exchange under incomplete markets Experimental Asset Markets; Bubble; Price Bubbles We test in a controlled laboratory environment whether traders in a bilateral exchange internalize the impact of their actions on market prices better than in a large market. In this model, traders choose asset holdings, constrained by a technology frontier. Next, each trader experiences a random shock which makes only one type of asset profitable. In a general equilibrium environment with incomplete markets, this leads to pecuniary externalities because traders increase scarce asset holdings beyond what is socially optimal. This behavior is especially exacerbated in large experimental markets as traders fail to internalize the impact of their actions on prices. We find that when markets are incomplete, a bilateral exchange can slightly mitigate the extent of pecuniary externalities, and weakly increase welfare."
"What can surveillance data and risk factor research contribute to a public health approach to preventing child sexual abuse? Child Sexual Abuse; Sexual Crime; Female Sex Offender The aim of this article was to consider how population-level surveillance data and risk factor research might be applied to a public health approach to preventing child sexual abuse. The focus is on the collection of data in relation to ethnicity. By drawing from the four principles approach to ethical decision making developed by Beauchamp and Childress, the expected benefits of data collection are weighed against possible harms to individuals and communities. It concludes that the identification of high-risk groups can inform prioritisation of resources, and the development of context-specific and culturally sensitive child sexual abuse prevention and intervention programmes. However, it is crucial to explain why child sexual abuse is more prevalent in some ethnic communities than others. Explanations about causes can reduce the potential for stigmatisation and marginalisation of individuals and communities, as well as challenge widely held myths about biological determinism and inability to change."
"Supporting early career project managers in construction: a multi-vocal study Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management Purpose: The aim of this paper is to explore the support that project managers receive from construction project-based organisations (PBOs) in their early careers. Design/methodology/approach: Fifty-seven semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with four key stakeholder groups including early career project managers (ECPMs) and employers from Australian construction PBOs, project management professional bodies, and university educators to ascertain (1) what organizations are currently doing and (2) what organizations can do better to support project managers in their early careers. Findings: Thematic analysis revealed that construction PBOs' responsibilities to ECPMs entailed: (1) providing mentoring, (2) offering training, (3) collaborating with universities, (4) giving time and feedback and (5) assigning manageable workloads. However, the findings revealed inconsistencies in companies enacting these responsibilities. Research limitations/implications: This research is limited to the context of the Australian construction industry, yet the findings shed valuable insights into the current practices of construction PBOs in supporting ECPMs. From a strategic resource-based view perspective, ECPMs have the potential to serve as long-term valuable organizational resources. Failure to invest in new professional entrants constitutes an area of untapped competitive advantage. Practical implications: Construction PBOs looking to better support their ECPMs may use the results of this research as a guide to tailor their early career professional development initiatives. Originality/value: The study adopts a holistic, multi-vocal approach by interviewing four key stakeholder groups. The findings contribute new insights into the role of construction PBOs in supporting ECPMs and the implications this has on the sustainability of their project management talent pool."
"Evacuation modelling for bushfire: the WUI-NITY simulation platform Wildfires; Wildland-Urban Interface; Disaster The number of people who live in bushfire-prone areas around the world is growing. In Australia, in the states of Victoria and New South Wales, over 1.5 million people live in areas rated as high to extreme bushfire risk in (SGS Economics and Planning 2019). As effects of climate change increase the size and severity of bushfires, and a greater number of people move into these at-risk areas, there is a growing imperative to understand the likely evacuation outcomes of bushfireprone communities under various fire scenarios. This paper introduces a freely available simulation platform called WUI-NITY that can be used by evacuation planners and decisionmakers to forecast evacuation behaviour within affected areas, and in turn, better prepare for and respond to future bushfire events."
"Exportin-1-dependent nuclear export of DEAD-box helicase DDX3X is central to its role in antiviral immunity DEAD-box RNA Helicase; RNA-dependent Atpase; Cancer DEAD-box helicase 3, X-linked (DDX3X) regulates the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR)-mediated antiviral response, but can also be a host factor contributing to the replication of viruses of significance to human health, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). These roles are mediated in part through its ability to actively shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm to modulate gene expression, although the tra_cking mechanisms, and impact thereof on immune signaling and viral infection, are incompletely defined. We confirm that DDX3X nuclear export is mediated by the nuclear transporter exportin-1/CRM1, dependent on an N-terminal, leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) and the monomeric guanine nucleotide binding protein Ran in activated GTP-bound form. Transcriptome profiling and ELISA show that exportin-1-dependent export of DDX3X to the cytoplasm strongly impacts IFN-Î² production and the upregulation of immune genes in response to infection. That this is key to DDX3Xâ€™s antiviral role was indicated by enhanced infection by human parainfluenza virus-3 (hPIV-3)/elevated virus production when the DDX3X NES was inactivated. Our results highlight a link between nucleocytoplasmic distribution of DDX3X and its role in antiviral immunity, with strong relevance to hPIV-3, as well as other viruses such as HIV-1."
"Aligning citizen science with best practice: Threatened species conservation in Australia Citizen Scientists; Monitoring; Volunteers Well-designed citizen science projects can improve the capacity of the scientific community to detect and understand declines in threatened species, and with the emer-gence of frameworks to guide good design, there is an opportunity to test whether projects are aligned with best practice. We assessed the current landscape of citizen science projects for threatened species conservation via a content analysis of the online communique of citizen science projects across Australia. Only 2% of projects stated clear research questions, although approximately 86% had implied project objectives aimed at threatened species conservation. Most projects were focused on field-based monitoring activities with half using structured ecological survey methods. Most reviewed projects (65%) shared data with open access biodiversity databases and the vast majority use at least one social media platform to communi-cate with potential and existing participants (up to 81%). Approximately 50% present citizen-sourced data summaries or publications on their websites. Our study shows there is a very strong foundation for public participation in threatened species conservation activities in Australia, yet there is scope to further integrate the principles of citizen science best practice. Improved integration of these principles will likely yield better outcomes for threatened species as well as for the citizen scientists themselves."
"Professional learning: A continuum reimagined Workplace; Vocational Education and Training; Apprenticeship Professional learning is integral to being in the workforce. In this article, ""professional learning"" ranges from student preparation for work, to the ongoing development of graduates in their careers. Given the rise of corporate learning academies and other capability-building programs within organizations, and the changing nature of work, this article highlights a need for universities to reimagine professional learning approaches. We argue that professional learning needs to be considered as a continuum by universities, employers of graduates, and graduates themselves, beyond current ideas about work-integrated learning. Otherwise, the risk is that universities will be left behind or left out of the evolving world of professional learning. We believe the transition between university studies and workplace careers will be smoother and more meaningful if professional learning approaches are aligned, with the student/employee learning journey centre stage. This article uses a comparative personal narrative methodology in exploring what can be learned from the experience of university educators to inform future models of professional learning. Based on the literature and practice examples discussed, future models are likely to include a clear focus on motivation for interdisciplinary social learning in networks. This involves a combination of mobile technology and faceto- face experiences, with a sense of belonging fostered for collaborative ""meaning making"" and enhanced personal and organizational productivity. It is vital to understand the learner context and culture, enable iterative practice using bestfit technology, and encourage critical reflection for transfer of learning to new situations."
"Anisakis Nematodes in Fish and Shellfish- from infection to allergies Anisakis; Fish; Contracaecum Anisakidosis is a zoonotic parasitosis induced by members of the family Anisakidae. The anisakid genera includes Anisakis, Pseudoterranova, Hysterothylacium and Contracaecum. The final definitive hosts of these nematodes are marine mammals with a complex life cycle. These nematode parasites use different crustaceans and fish species as intermediate or paratenic hosts and humans are accidental hosts. Human anisakiasis, the infections caused by members of the genus Anisakis, occurs, when seafoods, particularly fish, contaminated with the infective stage (third stage larvae [L3]) of this parasite, are consumed. Pseudoterranovosis, on the other hand is induced by members of the genus Pseudoterranova. These two genera of anisakids have been implicated in human disease globally. There is a rise in reports of gastro-intestinal infections accompanied by allergic reactions caused by Anisakis simplex and Anisakis pegreffii. This review provides an update on current knowledge on Anisakis as a food-borne parasite with special focus on the increasingly reported diversity of fish and crustacean hosts, allergens and immunological cross-reactivity with invertebrate proteins rendering this parasite a significant public health issue."

"Integrating demand response and renewable energy in wholesale market Demand Response; Demand Side Management; Energy Conservation Demand response (DR) can provide a cost-effectiveness approach for reducing peak load while renewable energy sources (RES) can result in an environmental-friendly solution for solving the problem of power shortage. The increasing integration of DR and renewable energy bring challenging issues for energy policy makers, and electricity market regulators in the power grid. In this paper, a new two-stage stochastic game model is introduced to operate the electricity market, where Stochastic Stackelberg-Cournot-Nash (SSCN) equilibrium is applied to characterize the optimal energy bidding strategy of the forward market and the optimal energy trading strategy of the spot market. The sampling average approximation (SAA) technique is harnessed to address the stochastic game model in a distributed way. By this game model, the participation ratio of demand response can be significantly increased while the unreliability of power system caused by renewable energy resources can be considerably reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed model is illustrated by extensive simulations."
"Thinking Inside the Box: A Closer Look at Financial Inclusion and Household Income Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion Using national representative household finance survey data covering more than 6200 Chinese households, we first construct a new multidimensional indicator for financial inclusion. Then we examine the effect of financial inclusion on household income. Our results elicit several findings. First, financial inclusion has a strong positive effect on household income. This effect can be found across all households with different levels of income. Second, low-income households are found to benefit more from financial inclusion than high and mid-level income ones. We argue that, in this sense, financial inclusion helps reduce income inequality."
"Isolation and characterization of cellulose nanomaterials from jute bast fibers Nanocellulose; Nanocrystal; Nanowhiskers This work describes a simple yet effective pathway for extracting cellulose nanomaterials from jute bast fibers by chemical pretreatment to isolate microfibrillated cellulose followed by either mechanical or acid hydrolysis to ultimately isolate cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), respectively. Analyses carried out through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) and solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) demonstrated that the pretreatments gradually removed lignins and hemicelluloses from the fibers. The yield of microfibrillated cellulose was 56.5% with respect to the initial dry mass of untreated fibers. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evaluated the morphological variation in the fiber dimension during the initial chemical pretreatment stages leading to extraction of microfibril 12â€“15 Âµm in average width. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirmed the nano-scale dimension of these nanocelluloses. The thermal stability of jute fibers at different stages of treatment was studied by thermogravimetric analysis. The high yield and high crystallinity of the nanocelluloses demonstrated effective isolation protocol confirming that jute bast fibers can be a valuable source for generation of nanomaterials."
"Addressing the design-implementation gap of sustainable business models by prototyping: A tool for planning and executing small-scale pilots Business Model Innovation; Innovation; Digital Transformation Next to the redesign of industrial products and processes, sustainable business model innovation is a strategic approach to integrate environmental and social concerns into the objectives and operations of organizations. One of the major challenges of this approach is that many promising business model ideas fail to reach the market, which is needed to achieve impact. In the literature, the issue is referred to as a â€œdesign-implementation gap.â€ This paper explores how that critical gap may be bridged. In doing so, we contribute to sustainable business model innovation theory and practice. We contribute to theory by connecting sustainable business model innovation with business experimentation and strategic design, two innovation approaches that leverage prototyping as a way to iteratively implement business ideas early on. Using a design science research methodology, we combine theoretical insights from these three literatures into a tool for setting up small-scale pilots of sustainable business models. We apply, evaluate, and improve our tool through a rigorous process by working with nine startups and one multinational company. As a result, we provide normative theory in terms of the sustainable business model innovation process, explaining that piloting a prototype forces organizations to simultaneously consider the desirability (i.e., what users want), feasibility (i.e., what is technically achievable), viability (i.e., what is financially possible), and sustainability (i.e., what is economically, socially and environmentally acceptable) of a new business model. Doing so early on is functional to bridge the design-implementation gap of sustainable business models. We contribute to practice with the tool itself, which organizations can use to translate sustainable business model ideas defined â€œon paperâ€ into small-scale pilots as a first implementation step. We encourage future research building on the limitations of this exploratory study by working with a larger sample of companies through longitudinal case studies, to further explain how these pilots can be executed successfully."
"Engaging with artificial intelligence (AI) with a bottom-up approach for the purpose of sustainability: Victorian farmers market association, Melbourne Australia Machine Ethics; Artificial Intelligence; Roboethics Artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting all aspects of food systems, including production, food processing, distribution, and consumption. AI, if implemented ethically for sustainability, can enhance biodiversity, conserve water and energy resources, provide land-related services, power smart cities, and help mitigate climate change. However, there are significant issues in using AI to transition to sustainable food systems. AIâ€™s own carbon footprint could cancel out any sustainability benefits that it creates. Additionally, the technology could further entrench inequalities between and within countries, and bias against minorities or less powerful groups. This paper draws on findings from a study of the Victorian Farmersâ€™ Markets Association (VFMA) that investigated the complexity of designing AI tools to enhance sustainability and resilience for the benefit of the organisation and its members. Codesign workshops, both synchronous and asynchronous, semi-structured interviews, and design innovation methods led the VFMA to experiment with an AI tool to link sustainable soil practices, nutrient rich produce, and human health. The analysis shows that the codesign process and an agile approach created a co-learning environment where sustainability and ethical questions could be considered iteratively within transdisciplinary engagement. The bottom-up approach developed through this study supports organisations who want to engage with AI while reinforcing fairness, transparency, and sustainability."
"The science and politics of climate risk assessment in Australia's Murray Darling Basin Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Climate change has many disruptive consequences, particularly in large river basins experiencing drying trends and declining water availability. With pressure for more adaptive policies, understanding how institutions governing water are adapting to climate risks has broad international relevance. This paper examines the challenges of climate risk assessments in Australia's Murray Darling Basin, an economically and culturally important basin where national legislation mandates a Basin Plan based on the best available science. However, despite repeated scientific warnings about a drying climate, the current Basin Plan does not reduce estimates of water resources available, and its climate risk management relies on a bricolage of policy mechanisms, which appear insufficient for the magnitude of predicted changes. This paper outlines the findings of original research exploring why this occurred. It draws on interviews with 30 senior public policy professionals and researchers with deep experience in climate and water policy. The interview data indicate that minimising political risks were the principal reasons for abandoning proposed reductions in entitlements and for relying on historical averages for estimating water availability. As the reform process evolved, decisions about water-planning techniques became increasingly politicised, and the adoption of explicit climate adaptation measures became problematic. As a result, the Basin Plan neither reflects the broad scientific consensus about climate change nor makes specific allowances for declining water availability. Climate risks are downplayed while concerns about levels of scientific uncertainties appear overstated. Importantly, lessons emerge from this examination that could contribute to the revisions of the Plan, scheduled for 2026. More generally, the research finds that proactive climate adaptation policies for large river basins require sustained and well-designed institutional reforms, particularly the adoption of legally prescribed procedures for utilising science - and accounting for its use - in controversial environmental reforms."
"Happy feet in a hostile world? The future of penguins depends on proactive management of current and expected threats Penguin; Eudyptes; Aptenodytes Forsteri Penguins face a wide range of threats. Most observed population changes have been negative and have happened over the last 60 years. Today, populations of 11 penguin species are decreasing. Here we present a review that synthesizes details of threats faced by the world's 18 species of penguins. We discuss alterations to their environment at both breeding sites on land and at sea where they forage. The major drivers of change appear to be climate, and food web alterations by marine fisheries. In addition, we also consider other critical and/or emerging threats, namely human disturbance near nesting sites, pollution due to oil, plastics and chemicals such as mercury and persistent organic compounds. Finally, we assess the importance of emerging pathogens and diseases on the health of penguins. We suggest that in the context of climate change, habitat degradation, introduced exotic species and resource competition with fisheries, successful conservation outcomes will require new and unprecedented levels of science and advocacy. Successful conservation stories of penguin species across their geographical range have occurred where there has been concerted effort across local, national and international boundaries to implement effective conservation planning."
"A review on the mechanism, impacts and control methods of membrane fouling in MBR system Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling Compared with the traditional activated sludge process, a membrane bioreactor (MBR) has many advantages, such as good effluent quality, small floor space, low residual sludge yield and easy automatic control. It has a promising prospect in wastewater treatment and reuse. However, membrane fouling is the biggest obstacle to the wide application of MBR. This paper aims at summarizing the new research progress of membrane fouling mechanism, control, prediction and detection in the MBR systems. Classification, mechanism, influencing factors and control of membrane fouling, membrane life prediction and online monitoring of membrane fouling are discussed. The research trends of relevant research areas in MBR membrane fouling are prospected."
"Gender, business and human rights: Academic activism as critical engagement in neoliberal times Intersectionality; Feminism; Social Location This paper contributes to the debate about academic activism in organization studies through an exploration of my engagement with recent international policy-making relating to gender, business, and human rights. It brings social movement theory to the debate to elucidate how our work as academic activists can be conceived of in terms of social movement strategies with respect to political opportunities, mobilizing structures, and strategic framing processes. The aim is to further elucidate what we do as academic activists, and how such actions might advance feminist social movement agendas through a process that is both critical AND engaged in neoliberal contexts. I conclude with a discussion of the implications for Gender, Work & Organization (GWO) scholars and the GWO journal."
"Initial sizing methodology for hybrid-electric general aviation aircraft Helicopter; Air Mobility; Propellers Electric and hybrid-electric propulsion offer unique possibilities to improve aircraft efficiency and performance. The potential advantages are fuel savings, lower emissions, and reduced noise. Because hybrid-electric aircraft generally apply multiple power sources, they can be designed to sustain flight if certain parts of the propulsion system fail. However, their additional degrees of freedom increase the complexity of the design process. This paper describes a methodology of an initial sizing algorithm that considers aircraft with hybrid-electric propulsion systems. A central element is a modified constraint diagram, which matches the power-to-weight ratio, wing loading, and the hybridization of power HP . It is coupled with a mission performance analysis that is capable of dealing with multiple energy sources and defines the mass and size of all relevant aircraft components. The modified constraint diagram also allows a visual assessment of the sizing results, and thereby greater insight into the design space."
"A novel concrete-filled auxetic tube composite structure: Design and compressive characteristic study Negative; Honeycomb Cores; Metamaterials Concrete-filled stainless steel tube (CFSST) members take advantage of the high strength and the outstanding corrosion resistance to act as an important role in civil engineering structures. However, the steel tube could not provide the perfect confinement effect for the core concrete during the initial elastic compression stage because Poisson's ratio of the concrete is smaller than that of the stainless steel tube (SST). In this paper, a novel concrete-filled auxetic stainless steel tube (CFASST) composite structure was designed and manufactured to actively restrain the concrete, making the best use of the desirable deformation characteristics of auxetic tubular structures. The axial compressive performance of these CFASST members and their control factors were investigated experimentally and numerically. Test results were discussed in detail which included failure modes, load versus displacement curves and strain analysis. Finally, parametric analyses were conducted to further study the effects of different parameters (Poisson's ratio, thickness of the stainless tube) on the CFSST composite structure under axial compression. It was found that CFASST composite structures possess an unusual deformation mode and an improved confinement effect."
"Valuing public transport customer experience infrastructure: An international expert Delphi study of methods & application Willingness To Pay; Stated Preference; Best-worst Scaling A worldwide trend in public transport has been a shift to enhance customer experience for users aboard public transport in addition to provide the fundamentals of planning and operations. This effort relies on the work of transport economists who develop â€˜willingness to payâ€™ methodologies that quantify the qualitative experiences of customers and provide value for various amenities. Although a considerable amount of research effort has been put towards determining the value that public transport users place on different amenity types, there is little understanding of current practice of amenity valuation as a whole. This paper presents results from a Delphi survey of international expert researchers and practitioners involved in customer amenity valuation, with the aim of determining what experts see as problems and issues in measurement, and best practices in approach to measurement. The major findings show that experts prefer stated preference methods due to the flexibility and range of variables possible, but stress the use of mixed methods approaches in best practice (e.g., a mixed stated and revealed preference method). In addition to good survey design, 78% of experts believed that Post Implementation Reviews should be conducted to check accuracy of amenity values, but reported on average that only 3.6% of values are check with Post Implementation Reviews."
"Analyzing for effective entrepreneurship strategy: A corporate entrepreneurship and innovation course Entrepreneurial Orientation; Corporate Entrepreneurship; Small And Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) As they grow, companies that were once characterised as agile, innovative and entrepreneurial, tend to become bureaucratic and slow to respond to changes in their environments. In order to stay competitive and build competitive advantage, managers realise that they have to rejuvenate the entrepreneurial spirit and innovate on a sustainable basis, yet this remains a significant challenge for them. Our corporate entrepreneurship and innovation course for post-graduate studentscultivates and understanding of entrepreneurship and innovation in the context of established business. Its unique design, which follows a logical progression of data collection in real-life participating organizations through secondary and primary research, assures in-depth understanding of the factors that shape the current organizational profiles. Students, working in teams, draw on this data and entrepreneurship and innovation theory to develop practical corporate entrepreneurship development plans which they present to their â€˜clientsâ€™. These plans reflect leadership orientation represented by entrepreneurial visions and strategies, as well as contextualised factors for control in the form of innovation processes and tools. Finally, teams recommend a range of tactics that foster supportive environments for entrepreneurship and innovation. In the process of doing so, students are themselves transformed from being traditional managers to becoming entrepreneurial managers."
"Anion exchange membrane organic fouling and mitigation in salt valorization process from high salinity textile wastewater by bipolar membrane electrodialysis Electrodialysis; Membrane; Desalination To achieve a cleaner production, textile wastewater with high organic and salt content can be treated by using Bipolar Membrane Electrodialysis (BMED)to minimize acid and base consumption in a dyeing process. While the dye molecules may foul the ion exchange membranes and strongly affect the desalination process. This work aimed to investigate the performance and fouling mechanisms of BMED during desalination of sodium sulfate from Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR). Results showed that maintaining the zeta potential of RBBR above âˆ’25 mV may mitigate fouling of AEM during the BMED process. This confirms that, zeta potential of charged foulants (RBBR)plays a key role in terms of controlling membrane fouling. Accordingly, a new parameter â€œcritical salt concentrationâ€ was introduced to control membrane fouling. Furthermore, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), FT-IR and electrochemical analysis confirmed that fouling of anion exchange membrane by RBBR was due to electrostatic interaction. Finally, it was calculated that 72.02% of sodium and 66.9% of sulfate in the feed were converted to NaOH and H2SO4, respectively. This study proves that BMED process may be an alternative way treating textile wastewater with high salinity and the presence of dye molecules."
"Building capacity for a user‐centred integrated early warning system for drought in Papua New Guinea Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China Drought has significant impacts on the agricultural productivity and wellâ€being of Pacific Island communities. In this study, a userâ€centred integrated early warning system (Iâ€EWS) for drought was investigated for Papua New Guinea (PNG). The Iâ€EWS combines satellite products (Standardised Precipitation Index and Vegetation Health Index) with seasonal probabilistic forecasting outputs (chance of exceeding median rainfall). Internationally accepted drought thresholds for each of these inputs are conditionally combined to trigger three drought early warning stagesâ€” â€DROUGHT WATCHâ€, â€œDROUGHT ALERTâ€ and â€œDROUGHT EMERGENCYâ€. The developed Iâ€ EWS for drought was used to examine the evolution of a strong El NiÃ±oâ€induced drought event in 2015 as well as a weaker La NiÃ±aâ€induced dry period in 2020. Examining the evolution of drought early warnings at a provincial level, it was found that tailored warning lead times of 3â€“5 months could have been possible for several impacted PNG provinces. These lead times would enable in-creasingly proactive drought responses with the potential for prioritised allocation of funds at a provincial level. The methodology utilised within this study uses inputs that are openly and freely available globally which indicates promising potential for adaptation of the developed userâ€centred Iâ€EWS in other Pacific Island Countries that are vulnerable to drought."

"A survey of elite and pre-elite athletes’ perceptions of key support, lifestyle and performance factors Youth Sports; Football; Athletes Background: Success at the elite level in sport is often attributed to physical prowess, technical skill, and mental attitude. However, underpinning these factors are various lifestyle, support and social factors that may contribute to successful performance, but which may be absent from athlete development programs. Methods: An online survey was used to investigate athlete perceptions of lifestyle practices and support services amongst 135 Australian Olympic, Paralympic, National, and state-level athletes across 25 Olympic sports. Results: International athletes perceived psychological skills and attributes, along with strong interpersonal relationships as vital to their success, and they also rated â€˜Recovery practicesâ€™ as very important and made extensive use of available support services. These athletes also indicated that they would have liked access to these services earlier in their careers, a wish that was reiterated by the sub-elite athletes. Furthermore, athletes wanted greater knowledge, mentoring, and autonomy earlier in their careers, and the importance of â€˜athlete wellbeingâ€™ as well as â€˜athletic performanceâ€™ was evident in a number of contexts. Conclusions: An athlete development system into which these are included may assist in generating an environment that facilitates athlete success, repeated podium performances, retain athletes in high-performance sport for longer, encourage human-flourishing, wellbeing and smooth transitions for retiring athletes."
"Does procedural justice climate increase the identification and engagement of migrant workers? A group engagement model perspective Fairness; Social Exchange Theory; Fairness Perceptions Purpose: Migrant workers often suffer from social exclusion in the workplace and therefore identify less with their organization and engage less with their work. To address this issue, the authors integrate research on migrant workers with research on the group engagement model to create a model for understanding and enhancing migrant worker engagement. This allows us to provide insight into how organizations can design their human resource management systems and practices to increase the work engagement of migrant workers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a survey study with over 4,000 employees from more than 500 workplaces in Australia to test the model. Findings: The results of the multilevel analysis indicate that a procedurally fair work environment increases organizational identification, which in turn is associated with higher work engagement. The results also indicate that procedural justice climate is more important for migrant workers and increases their organizational identification and engagement. Originality/value: To increase work engagement of migrant workers, organizations can establish a procedurally fair work environment in which cultural minorities experience unbiased policies and procedures, are able to express their opinions and participate in decision-making."
"FinTech: Harnessing Innovation for Financial Inclusion New Product Development; Fuzzy Front End; Innovation The landscape of financial inclusion has for long been considered as the soft side of financial services, having received scarce attention from a financial, regulatory, and policy point of view, despite its central role within the global economic empowerment. Part of the disadvantaged and low-income segments of global population is left without (i.e. financially excluded) or very limited access (i.e. financially underserved) to basic financial services, creating a highly critical equality deficit in different parts of the world. In this frame of reference, financial exclusion still remains a highly critical problem that hinders developing regions around the world from eradicating poverty leading to large-scale starvation and civil unrest. Moreover, financial exclusion is interwoven with social dependency making financially excluded/underserved populations strongly dependable on their social networks. The emergence of FinTech, the new breed between financial innovation and financial technology, which has been challenging the prevailing position of incumbent financial institutions, is providing a promising vehicle of tackling this phenomenon by closing the gap between unbanked, under-banked and developed societies, opening the door to the global digital economy, bringing a long-term societal transformational change for the financially excluded/underserved, while leading to inclusive economic growth helping move towards a more just and equitable society."
"Corporate political donations, board gender diversity, and corporate social responsibility: Evidence from Australia Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence We examine the association between corporate political donations (CPDs) and the quality of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) listed firms. We also explore the effect of board membersâ€™ gender diversity on this association. Consistent with legitimacy and neopluralist argument, we report a negative association between corporate political donations and the quality of CSR disclosures. Furthermore, board gender diversity acts as the moderator and mitigates the negative association between political donations and CSR disclosures. We also find that it requires more than one female director to moderate the association between CPDs and CSR disclosures which provides support to the critical mass theory. Our additional analysis reveals that the negative association between CPDs and the quality of CSR disclosures is stronger for the resource industry, and the proportion of female directors has an insignificant effect on this association."
"Climate change impacts on rice-based livelihood vulnerability in the lower Vietnamese Mekong Delta: Empirical evidence from Can Tho City and Tra Vinh Province Mekong River; Dams; Hydropower This paper assesses the livelihood vulnerability and adaptive capacity of rice-based farmers in the lower Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) under the impact of climate change and environmental pressures. We interviewed 600 rice farmers in 19 communes spanning six districts of Can Tho City (middle delta) and Tra Vinh Province (coastal delta). For our analyses, we employed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) framework and the LVI approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (LVIâ€“IPCC). Results indicate that both study areas are vulnerable to climate change and environmental pressures, but the potential threat is greater in the coastal province. Farmers there have responded to climate change and environmental pressures by increasing production inputs, scaling up production areas and transforming cropping patterns, though with little investment in new equipment. Yet, their livelihoods from rice cultivation, and agricultural production in general, remain unsustainable under climate change, which is a matter of concern. This study provides empirical evidence of the vulnerability factors that most undermine farmersâ€™ adaptive capacity and livelihood sustainability in the study areas. This will help local authorities in providing timely support to agricultural production management."
"External wind on the optimum designing parameters of a wall solar chimney in building Hot Temperature; Solar Chimneys; Natural Ventilation Solar chimney is a reliable renewable energy system that enhances the natural ventilation to reduce the energy consumption in buildings. Under the fact that previous optimization designs usually ignore the external wind, the impacts of external wind on the optimum designing parameters are then investigated. It is confirmed that external wind could affect its optimum designing parameters, which are different from those previously obtained value in the literature without considering the external wind. For the analysed wall solar chimney, it was known that previously obtained optimal cavity depth of 0.2â€“0.3 m is no longer applicable under the external wind, and the optimal value rises to 0.4â€“0.5 m, while the same applies to inlet height/area. Solar chimney performance is enhanced under the external wind, which is not only because of the incoming wind flow from the room opening but also the reduced air resistance. It was observed that increased solar intensity shows limited influences on the overall airflow characteristics. Solar chimney performance also presented a generally enhanced trend under a low external wind speed, but a strong wind could dominate its performance with limited fluctuation even though the wind angle is higher as 45Â°. It was known that the airflow rates through the solar chimney are largely hampered with a small cavity depth (i.e., smaller than 0.2 m) and inlet height under the external wind. And the airflow profiles are less affected when both of cavity depth and inlet height are bigger than 0.2 m. The obtained research outcomes could provide a technical guide on the optimization design of solar chimney in buildings."
"Should Australia be embracing the modern slavery model of regulation? Human Trafficking; Sexual Exploitation; Prostitution Australia is following in the footsteps of the UK and US and embracing the discourse and regulatory technologies associated with modern slavery regulation. This paper offers a critical perspective on this development. It begins with a brief account of the conceptâ€™s rise to prominence, and discusses the political economy in which it is embedded. It then explores some of the advantages, as well as the pitfalls, associated with the frame, and its associated regulatory approaches, techniques and discourse. The authors raise three broad sets of concerns. The first goes to the danger of exclusively focusing on criminal justice responses to penalise and deter those who practice modern slavery while neglecting other approaches that may help address the causes of the phenomenon. The second set of concerns goes to the tendency to exaggerate the transformative potential of one of the dominant regulatory responses in this area: the mandatory corporate supply chain reporting provision. The third set of concerns relate to the implications of addressing issues of worker exploitation and mistreatment through a modern slavery and human trafficking approach rather than through other well established and newer regulatory means. To support the third argument, the authors compare the modern slavery approach with two alternate approaches: labour regulation and human rights due diligence. The authors emphasise the need for vigilance to ensure that the embracement of a modern slavery frame does not shift attention (and resources) away from more thorough and effective means of securing greater corporate accountability for labour standards in supply chains."
"Insights into business strategies for reducing food waste in the Australian food industry Business Model Innovation; Innovation; Digital Transformation A significant amount of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted worldwide. To prevent and reduce food waste, the food industry needs a productive and profitable approach. Such approaches often entail businesses making decisions that utilise and integrate sustainability tools. Integrating tools into businesses can inform their sustainability strategies and activities. This sustainability-driven opportunity indicates a need to gain insights into business strategies for reducing food waste and the tools used to do so. The current study reviews these strategies and tools by examining publicly available Australian food industry documents. Based on an analysis of secondary sources, this review identified 40 food businesses and revealed their various strategies for reducing food waste. The review found that several businesses use various strategies to reduce food waste, including sustainable farming, diverting waste from landfills and donating unsold food. However, preventative strategies for surplus food creation have received less attention in addressing the causes of food waste. Interestingly, little published information on the tools contributing to more sustainable food production. The review's findings can provide practical implications and guidelines through a more nuanced understanding of food waste strategies. The conclusion also explains the study's limitations and suggests further research areas."
"Connecting the grids: A review of blockchain governance in distributed energy transitions Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things Critical effects of global climate change urgently call for socio-technical transitions towards more efficient, flexible and cleaner energy systems. However, adequate regulatory frameworks and policy incentives are lagging behind. This paper focuses on the governance dynamics shaping technology-enabled transitions towards distributed energy systems. The purpose of this review is to assess the potential role of blockchain technology in enhancing the governance of sociotechnical energy transitions. For this, the paper reviews: (1) the governance arrangements shaping distributed energy transitions, (2) the emergence of blockchain-based solutions in the energy sector (focusing on P2P energy trading platforms) and, (3) the role of the blockchain in overcoming the governance limitations of distributed energy transitions. The study addresses emerging but interrelated niches of academic study from an integral conceptualization and synthesis of the literature. Rather than extensively covering these fields of research, the purpose is to connect these areas of academic knowledge and expand the theoretical understanding stemming from this convergence. The findings show the potential of blockchain-based governance to overcome institutional barriers related to trust-building and enhanced coordination for community-based energy transitions."
"How to build Urbanome, the genome of the city? Air Quality Monitoring; Air Quality; Microbalances The world's population is shifting to the cities, and consequently, cities worldwide are growing in number and in size. Cities are complex systems, making it extremely difficult to build and run cities in a way that all the elements of the system operate in harmony. Recently a concept of urbanome, the genome of the city was proposed to address this complexity. Here we first explore this concept and analogy, taking advantage of the potential of other â€˜omics, modern data collection techniques, Big Data analysis methods and a transdisciplinary approach. Then, we propose a theoretical approach to build the urbanome as a means of quantifying and qualifying population outcomes, being a function of the form of an urban area including the built environment, the physical and social services it provides, and the population density."
"Decision-making of municipal urban forest managers through the lens of governance Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Awareness of the benefits of urban trees has led many cities to develop ambitious targets to increase tree numbers and canopy cover. Policy instruments that guide the planning of cities recognize the need for new governance arrangements to implement this agenda. Urban forests are greatly influenced by the decisions of municipal managers, but there is currently no clear understanding of how municipal managers find support to implement their decisions via new governance arrangements. To fill this knowledge gap, we collected empirical data through interviews with 23 urban forest municipal managers in 12 local governments in Greater Melbourne and regional Victoria, Australia, and analysed these data using qualitative interpretative methods through a governance lens. The goal of this was to understand the issues and challenges, stakeholders, resources, processes, and rules behind the decision-making of municipal managers. Municipal managers said that urban densification and expansion were making it difficult for them to implement their strategies to increase tree numbers and canopy cover. The coordination of stakeholders was more important for managers to find support to implement their decisions than having a bigger budget. The views of the public or wider community and a municipal government culture of risk aversion were also making it difficult for municipal managers to implement their strategies. Decision-making priorities and processes were not the same across urban centres. Lack of space to grow trees in new developments, excessive tree removal, and public consultation, were ideas more frequently raised in inner urban centres, while urban expansion, increased active use of greenspaces, and lack of data/information about tree assets were concerns for outer and regional centres. Nonetheless, inter-departmental coordination was a common theme shared among all cities. Strengthening coordination processes is an important way for local governments to overcome these barriers and effectively implement their urban forest strategies."
"No Handmaidens Here: women, volunteering and gender dynamics in the Sydney New Theatre American Film; Newsreels; Theaters This paper considers the role of women in the Sydney branch of the New Theatre, from 1936 to 1969. In contrast to other gendered spaces found in the theatrical, industrial and political spheres, women held together the New Theatre. Not only did the theatre give opportunities to women as performers, but women embraced roles as directors, stage managers, writers, designers as well as holding elected offices. Drawing on oral histories and archival research, this study presents new scholarship on Australian womenâ€™s leadership in the theatre, arguing that their pattern of involvement was shaped by the voluntary nature of the work, the longevity of involvement, their political commitment and the theatreâ€™s democratic structure. The blending of organisational and creative leadership created spaces for womenâ€™s voices in ways that were crucial to the long-term success of the Theatre, at a time when women were generally expected to focus on the domestic sphere."
"Communicating Health and Safety on a Multinational Construction Project: Challenges and Strategies Personnel; Career Barriers; Employed Women The health and safety (H&S) of workers is a critical project management goal in construction. As globalization and migrant movement increases, construction projects are becoming more nationally diverse. Among multinational workforces, language barriers present an obvious but largely unresolved H&S communication challenge, with current strategies in use yet to be assessed. On a large construction project in the United Kingdom, H&S communication strategies were explored through an ethnographic approach. This paper contributes by revealing the impracticalities of using employees as interpreters in workgroups of six or more and the limitations of technologies in a dynamic construction site environment. It also highlights the unresolved challenge of translating safety videos in multiple languages. Challenges arose including translators refusing to translate because they were not receiving extra financial benefits or recognition in their workload. Translators were also given favorable treatment during disciplinary processes because they were crucial to the continued operation of the site team. This reveals the complexities involved in implementing effective H&S communication strategies on international and multinational projects, which have previously remained largely ignored."
"Advances in transcriptomics of plants Argonaute Proteins; Gene; Nicotiana Benthamiana The current global population of 7.3 billion is estimated to reach 9.7 billion in the year 2050. Rapid population growth is driving up global food demand. Additionally, global climate change, environmental degradation, drought, emerging diseases, and salty soils are the current threats to global food security. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of these diverse agricultural productivity constraints and enhance crop yield and stress-tolerance in plants, we need to go beyond traditional and molecular plant breeding. The powerful new tools for genome editing, Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) and Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas systems (CRISPR-Cas9), have been hailed as a quantum leap forward in the development of stress-resistant plants. Plant breeding techniques, however, have several drawbacks. Hence, identification of transcriptional regulatory elements and deciphering mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation are crucial to avoiding unintended consequences in modified crop plants, which could ultimately have negative impacts on human health. RNA splicing as an essential regulated post-transcriptional process, alternative polyadenylation as an RNA-processing mechanism, along with non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, small interfering RNAs and long non-coding RNAs) have been identified as major players in gene regulation. In this chapter, we highlight new findings on the essential roles of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation in plant development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. We also discuss biogenesis and the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants and recent advances in our knowledge of the roles of miRNAs and siRNAs in plant stress response."
"Making publics in a pandemic: Posthuman relationalities, ‘viral' intimacies and COVID-19 Therapeutic Landscapes; Medical Geography; Mental Health The COVID-19 pandemic has placed sexual relationships into sharp focus as strict containment measures, including physical distancing and â€˜stay at homeâ€™ restrictions, were initiated to control the spread of the virus. Governments in some jurisdictions prevented contact between non-cohabiting sexual partners (except for couples in pre-existing relationships), while community organisations recommended people avoid casual sexual encounters. This article analyses Australian media articles, commentary and public health messages published during March to October 2020 to explore the normative assumptions underpinning these measures. Applying posthumanist perspectives and Warnerâ€™s (2002) conceptualisation of â€˜publicsâ€™, we consider how COVID-19 public health advice enacts the (human) subject of public health as monogamous, coupled, and living with their partner or nuclear family. Those in non-normative relationships and households are not only excluded from this narrow enactment of the â€˜idealâ€™ public health subject, but are rendered potentially risky disease vectors by virtue of their alternative kinship arrangements. We explore the implications of these findings for the more-than-human relationalities that shape health inequalities and processes of marginalisation during public health crises, and we offer suggestions for public health measures that address the needs of diverse â€˜publicsâ€™."
"Who trusts the bank of England and high street banks in Britain? Social Trust; World Values Survey; Civil Society Following the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008 there was recognition that client trust in financial institutions had been damaged. While institutional trust has become an accepted barometer, less is known about who trusts the banking and finance sector. This paper investigates the individual characteristics associated with trust for the Bank of England (BoE) and high street banks in Britain. Importantly, we consider this question in the context of a point in time, namely 2014. This is an important case study as it is some years after the initial impact of the GFC yet prior to the referendum vote for Britain to exit the European Union (Brexit) and coincides with the Scottish referendum. Our results suggest that the characteristics associated with trust in the BoE differ from those associated with trust in high street banks and other financial institutions. Specifically, older people, more educated people and people residing in London show higher levels of trust in the BoE. In terms of trust in the sector overall, we also find that positive perceptions on the availability of credit are correlated with higher levels of trust."
"Trends in performance factors of large photovoltaic solar plants Hot Temperature; Phase Change Materials; Photovoltaic System This short communication discusses the two parameters recently emerged as a Key Performance Indicator of solar energy facilities, the mean capacity factor over a year, and the standard deviation of the capacity factor computed with high-frequency sampling. Both parameters impact directly and indirectly on the Levelised Cost Of Electricity (LCOE), permitting to quantify the energy production by the specific facility, and the attribution of the grid energy storage costs to the specific facility. The annual average capacity factors of the latest, largest, 53 photovoltaic (PV) solar energy facilities in the US, vary between 10% and 36%, with a mean value of 27% and a standard deviation of 5%. There are large differences also in between plants located in areas of a similar solar resource. Inference of long term performance degradation or O&M costs is difficult. We know from Australia that solar PV facilities work with high-frequency capacity factorsâ€™ standard deviations larger than the mean, for coefficients of variability above unity, and significant variability also at the grid level. This variability necessitates of energy storage. High-frequency data to assess the standard deviation of the individual US facility contribution to the different grids, as well as the energy storage needed for every grid, is unavailable. Construction cost data are less reliable than energy production data and mostly missing. Based on data for 15 plants, completed between 2014 and 2017, the construction cost dramatically varies between different facilities. The specific cost varies between 1,719 [US$/kW] and 7,143 [US$/kW], an average of 3,983 [US$/kW]. Considering the actual generating power vs. the nominal generating power, the specific cost varies between 6,374 and 22,806, an average 14,006 [US$/kW]. Hence, an accurate prediction of the LCOE of large PV facilities in the US is presently difficult."
"Impacts of defocusing amount and molten pool boundaries on mechanical properties and microstructure of selective laser melted AlSi10Mg Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) The influences of processing parameters such as volumetric energy density (Îµ) and, particularly, defocusing amount (DA) on densification, microstructure, tensile property, and hardness of the as-printed dense AlSi10Mg alloy by selective laser melting (SLM) were studied systematically. The molten pool boundaries (MPBs) were found overwhelmingly at regular and complex spatial topological structures affected by DA value to exist in two forms, while the ""layer-layer"" MPB overlay mutually and the ""track-track"" MPBs intersect to form acute angles with each other. The microstructure of MPBs exhibits a coarse grain zone near the MPBs and the characteristics of segregation of nonmetallic elements (O, Si) where the crack easily happened. The DA value (-2 to 2 mm) affected both the density and the tensile mechanical properties. High tensile strength (456 Â± 14 MPa) and good tensile ductility (9.5 Â± 1.4%) were achieved in the as-printed condition corresponding to DA = 0.5 mm. The tensile fracture surface features were analyzed and correlated to the influence of the DA values."
"Expert systems and the prospects of artificial intelligence for the automatic supervisory control of salinity gradient solar ponds Solar Ponds; Salinity; Exergy Salt Gradient Solar Ponds (SGSPs) are conventionally operated wholly manually. They hence suffer from a loss of efficiency for substantial durations when disturbed by natural diffusion and environmental elements such as temperature variation, solar radiation, and wind. They also impose considerable operational costs and time when a repair is unavoidable. Here, a Zero-Discharge Closed Cycle (ZDClC) is proposed for sustainable implementation of control architectures. We then define the SGSP as a control system and propose an automatic approach that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to mimic expertsâ€™ actions during repair operations. More specifically, an Automatic Supervisory Controller (ASC-SGSP) is proposed that decomposes the pond into several uniform sublayers according to their thicknesses and salt concentrations. The automated supervisor then uses a decision tree analysis of pond stability to determine the sequences of injection/suction actions to guarantee the pond stability and prevent layer overturning. An onâ€“off subcontroller then directs the chosen sublayer's salt density to its desired value. The supervisory structure is general and can operate with either the proposed open-loop or closed-loop configurations. Results indicate the potential utility of AI and expert systems as a successful paradigm for SGSP control. Specifically, the proposed approach is examined in a simulated pond under several scenarios challenging its efficiency, adaptivity, robustness, and constraint handling properties. The ASC-SGSP fulfills the automatic control requirements during either open/closed-loop configurations and regulates the desired salinity levels under parameter constraints and uncertainties, even when the SGSP parameters are perturbed by as much as 50%."

"ExamGAN and Twin-ExamGAN for Exam Script Generation Programming; Automatic; Computer Software Nowadays, the learning management system (LMS) has been widely used in different educational stages from primary to tertiary education for student administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, and delivery of educational courses, training programs, or learning and development programs. Towards effective learning outcome assessment, the exam script generation problem has attracted many attentions recently. But the research in this field is still in its early stage. Two essential issues have been ignored largely by existing solutions. First, given a course, it is unknown yet how to generate an quality exam script which concurrently has (i) the proper difficulty level, (ii) the coverage of essential knowledge points, (iii) the capability to distinguish academic performances between students, and (iv) the student scores in normal distribution. Second, while frequently encountered in practice, it is unknown so far how to generate a pair of high quality exam scripts which are equivalent in assessment (i.e., the student scores are comparable by taking either of them) but have significantly different sets of questions. To fill the gap, this paper proposes ExamGAN (Exam Script Generative Adversarial Network) to generate high quality exam scripts, and then extends ExamGAN to T-ExamGAN (Twin-ExamGAN) to generate a pair of high quality exam scripts. Based on extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, it has verified the superiority of proposed solutions in various aspects against the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we have conducted a case study which demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed solution in the real teaching scenarios."
"Matching symbiotic associations of an endangered orchid to habitat to improve conservation outcomes Germination; Tulasnella; Cephalanthera Background and Aims: An understanding of mycorrhizal variation, orchid seed germination temperature and the effect of co-occurring plant species could be critical for optimizing conservation translocations of endangered plants with specialized mycorrhizal associations. Methods: Focusing on the orchid Thelymitra epipactoides, we isolated mycorrhizal fungi from ten plants within each of three sites; Shallow Sands Woodland (SSW), Damp Heathland (DH) and Coastal Heathland Scrub (CHS). Twenty-seven fungal isolates were tested for symbiotic germination under three 24 h temperature cycles: 12 Â°C for 16 h-16 Â°C for 8 h, 16 Â°C for 16 h-24 Â°C for 8 h or 27 Â°C constant. Fungi were sequenced using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), nuclear large subunit 1 (nLSU1), nLSU2 and mitochondrial large rRNA gene (mtLSU). Orchids were grown to maturity and co-planted with each of ten associated plant species in a glasshouse experiment with tuber width measured at 12 months after co-planting. Key Results: Two Tulasnella fungal lineages were isolated and identified by phylogenetic analyses, operational taxonomic unit 1 (OTU1) and 'T. asymmetrica'. Fungal lineages were specific to sites and did not co-occur. OTU1 (from the SSW site) germinated seed predominantly at 12-16 Â°C (typical of autumn-winter temperature) whereas 'T. asymmetrica' (from the DH and CHS sites) germinated seed across all three temperature ranges. There was no difference in the growth of adult orchids germinated with different OTUs. There was a significant reduction in tuber size of T. epipactoides when co-planted with six of the commonly co-occurring plant species. Conclusions: We found that orchid fungal lineages and their germination temperature can change with habitat, and established that translocation sites can be optimized with knowledge of co-occurring plant interactions. For conservation translocations, particularly under a changing climate, we recommend that plants should be grown with mycorrhizal fungi tailored to the recipient site."
"A novel auxetic acoustic metamaterial plate with tunable bandgap Crystal; Metamaterials; Energy Gap Two-dimensional phononic metamaterials, consisting of plates with resonant cylinders, can significantly attenuate waves by opening a subwavelength bandgap, though their characteristic unit cell size is small. To realize the real-time adjustment of the bandgap, external excitations including mechanical load, temperature field, electric field and magnetic field could be introduced, of which applying mechanical load is the most practical way. In this work, an acoustic metamaterial plate based on the negative Poisson's ratio structure (NP-AMP) is proposed and feasible to achieve lower frequency, wider bandgap, and tunable bandgap compared with traditional ones (T-AMP). A counterpart based on the positive Poisson's ratio structure (PP-AMP) is also introduced for comparison. Studies have indicated that the newly designed structure has a lower frequency bandgap and wider bandwidth. With the increase of compression strain, the initial bandgap of PP-AMP gradually moves to a higher-frequency range. In contrast to PP-AMP, the NP-AMP exhibits lower frequency, which is beneficial for the further research of low-frequency bandgap. Moreover, the bandgap variation range can be enlarged by the enhancement of the auxetic behavior. Finally, the variation range of the NP-AMP initial bandgap frequency increased by 62%. The findings in this work will broaden the design of low-frequency broadband acoustic devices used in a dynamic environment, while providing new ideas and methodologies for real-time adjustment of bandgaps."
"Dietary Uptake and Depuration Kinetics of Perfluorooctane Sulfonate, Perfluorooctanoic Acid, and Hexafluoropropylene Oxide Dimer Acid (GenX) in a Benthic Fish Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitously distributed throughout aquatic environments and can bioaccumulate in organisms. We examined dietary uptake and depuration of a mixture of 3 PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C8HF15O2), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS; C8HF17SO3), and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HPFO-DA; C6HF11O3; trade name GenX). Benthic fish (blue spot gobies, Pseudogobius sp.) were fed contaminated food (nominal dose 500 ng gâ€“1) daily for a 21-d uptake period, followed by a 42-d depuration period. The compounds PFOA, linear-PFOS (linear PFOS), and total PFOS (sum of linear and branched PFOS) were detected in freeze-dried fish, whereas GenX was not, indicating either a lack of uptake or rapid elimination (<24 h). Depuration rates (dâ€“1) were 0.150 (PFOA), 0.045 (linear-PFOS), and 0.042 (linear+branched-PFOS) with corresponding biological half-lives of 5.9, 15, and 16 d, respectively. The PFOS isomers were eliminated differently, resulting in enrichment of linear-PFOS (70â€“90%) throughout the depuration period. The present study is the first reported study of GenX dietary bioaccumulation potential in fish, and the first dietary study to investigate uptake and depuration of multiple PFASs simultaneously, allowing us to determine that whereas PFOA and PFOS accumulated as expected, GenX, administered in the same way, did not appear to bioaccumulate.

"Understanding the design of playful experiences around ingestible sensors Embodied; Interaction Design; Ergonomics The advancement of sensor technology has provided new opportunities for bodily play and consequently enriched our bodily experiences. The emergence of ingestible sensors supports capturing the userâ€™s body data continuously. The intimacy between ingestible sensors and human body also shapes our bodily experiences. My research focuses on utilizing ingestible sensors to facilitate playful and engaging experiences in HCI using a Research through Design approach. This will lead to the development of ingestible interfaces, which allow the creation of novel and playful experiences. My work so far has explored the playful experiences that can be designed without crafting the relationships between the userâ€™s body and ingestible sensors. This research will contribute to the understanding of how to design playful experiences around ingestible sensors and ultimately inspire designers to create a wider range of future play experiences."
"Estimating transportation network impedance to last-mile delivery a case study of maribyrnong city in melbourne Freight Transport; City Logistics; Cargo Purpose â€“ The purpose of this paper is to measure and map the potential transportation network impedance to last-mile delivery (LMD) using spatial measures representing attributes of road network and planning controls. Design/methodology/approach â€“ The transport network impedance is estimated as the potential hindrance to LMD as imposed by the characteristics of the built and regulatory environment. A matrix of key transport and planning measures are generated and overlaid in geographical information systems to compute and visualise the levels of transportation network impedance to LMD using a composite indexing method. Findings â€“ The mapped outputs reveal significant spatial variation in transportation network impedance to LMD across different part of the study area. Significant differences were detected along the road segments that connect key industrial hubs or activity centres especially along tram routes and freight corridors, connecting the Port of Melbourne and logistic hub with the airport and the Western Ring Road. Research limitations/implications â€“ The use of static measures of transport and urban planning restricts the robustness of the impedance index, which can be enhanced through better integration of dynamic and real-time movements of business-to-business LMD of goods. Spatial approach is valuable for broader urban planning at a metropolitan or council level; however, its use is somewhat limited in assisting the daily operational planning and logistics decision making in terms of dynamic routing and vehicle scheduling. Practical implications â€“ The built and regulatory environment contributes to the severity of LMD problem in urban areas. The use of land use controls as instruments to increase city compactness in strategic nodes/hubs is more likely to deter the movement of urban freight. The mapped outputs would help urban planners and logisticians in mitigating the potential delay in last-mile deliveries through devising localised strategies such as dedicated freight corridors or time-bound deliveries in congested areas of road network. Originality/value â€“ This is the first study that measured the potential transport network impedance to LMD and improved understanding of the complex interactions between urban planning measures and LMD. Micro-scale mapping of transportation network impedance at the street level adds an innovative urban planning dimension to research in the growing field of city logistics."
"Source and central level recovery of nutrients from urine and wastewater: A state-of-art on nutrients mapping and potential technological solutions Struvite; Waste Water; Phosphorus Wastewater treatment facilities typically transform nitrogen compounds into innocuous nitrogen. Phosphorous is partially recovered in biosolids while the potassium cycle in the treatment process is still not well mapped. This paper provides a mapping of the nutrients from household sources (urine, faeces and greywater) to wastewater in the traditional wastewater treatment plants. Following this mapping, the article critically reviews the nutrients recovery technologies, including their applicability at source (for urine) and centralised (for wastewater) levels, benchmarking, social acceptance, and techno-commercial assessments. Additionally, the paper has identified the current technological challenges and opportunities as well as suggested a several future recommendations for developing commercially viable nutrient recovery technologies from urine at source level and wastewater at wastewater treatment plants (centralised level). The high energy requirement, high cost and safety issues are some of the common challenges for most of the nutrient recovery technologies. However, anaerobic membrane bioreactor integrated with biochar or zeolite (for wastewater) and biosorption (for both urine and wastewater) can be highly attractive from those perspectives."
"Assessing agricultural drought management strategies in the Northern Murray–Darling Basin Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China The Northern Murrayâ€“Darling Basin (MDB) is a key Australian agricultural region requiring efficient Agricultural Drought Management (ADM), focused on resilience. Although a need for resilience in local farming communities has long been recognised, previous studies assessing ADM in the Northern MDB did not consider two key elements of resilient management: proactivity (preparing for drought prior to a drought event) and suitability (localised drought management targeted at decision-makers). This study assessed the current ADM Strategy (ADMS) implemented within five selected Northern MDB Local Government Areas (LGAs) (Paroo Shire, Balonne Shire, Murweh Shire, Maranoa Region, and Goondiwindi Region), specifically investigating the extent of ADMS proactivity, effectiveness, and suitability. To investigate suitability, drought risk extent of each LGA was determined. A region-specific drought risk index consisting of hazard, vulnerability and exposure indices was developed; risk mapping was conducted. All LGAs displayed very high levels of drought risk due to hazardous climatic conditions, vulnerable socio-economic attributes, and drought-exposed geographical features. A Criteria-Based Ranking (CBR) survey produced a quantitative effectiveness and proactivity rank for each major ADMS used in the Northern MDB. Government Assistance was the most proactive and effective ADMS. Strategy effectiveness ranks of the major ADMS used and drought risk extent found in each LGA were correlated to determine ADMS suitability. Overall, Balonne Shire and the Goondiwindi Region were identified as high priority areas requiring improved ADM. A user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought could potentially increase ADM proactivity and suitability in such areas, strengthening drought resilience of farming communities."
"Progress and Pitfalls in the Quest for Effective SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Vaccines Nasopharyngeal Swabs; Serologic Tests; COVID-19 There are currently around 200 SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines in preclinical and clinical trials throughout the world. The various candidates employ a range of vaccine strategies including some novel approaches. Currently, the goal is to prove that they are safe and immunogenic in humans (phase 1/2 studies) with several now advancing into phase 2 and 3 trials to demonstrate efficacy and gather comprehensive data on safety. It is highly likely that many vaccines will be shown to stimulate antibody and T cell responses in healthy individuals and have an acceptable safety profile, but the key will be to confirm that they protect against COVID-19. There is much hope that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be rolled out to the entire world to contain the pandemic and avert its most damaging impacts. However, in all likelihood this will initially require a targeted approach toward key vulnerable groups. Collaborative efforts are underway to ensure manufacturing can occur at the unprecedented scale and speed required to immunize billions of people. Ensuring deployment also occurs equitably across the globe will be critical. Careful evaluation and ongoing surveillance for safety will be required to address theoretical concerns regarding immune enhancement seen in previous contexts. Herein, we review the current knowledge about the immune response to this novel virus as it pertains to the design of effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the range of novel and established approaches to vaccine development being taken. We provide details of some of the frontrunner vaccines and discuss potential issues including adverse effects, scale-up and delivery."
"The environmental effect of trade liberalization: Evidence from China's manufacturing firms Misallocation; China; Firm Heterogeneity While prior literature on trade liberalisation and the environment has mostly focused on the macroeconomic ramifications, this study explores at the firm level whether and how changes of trade barriers brought about by China's accession to the WTO may impact on its manufacturing firmsâ€™ environmental performance. Adopting a difference-in-differences (DID) methodology, we document the effects of tariff reductions on improving firm-level SO2 emission intensity, and the key corporate strategic decisions responsible for delivering the observed results, with robustness tests covering other major pollutants. In response to trade liberalisation, firms are found to increase labour resources for environmental protection and to improve their production processes to reduce emission intensity. This study contributes to the literature by investigating at the level of the operating firm how output and input tariff reductions may impact on environmental performance and uncovering for the first time the specific actions responsible for the results."
"Editorial: Visibility matters – women in neonatology Academic Medicine; Medical School; Female Physician We are delighted to present the inaugural Frontiers in Pediatrics Women in Neonatology series. Gender inequity in health and medical research has been perpetuated by longstanding biases (including unconscious bias), stereotypes and structural barriers to the recruitment, retention, career progression and recognition of womenâ€™s achievements. While many structural changes are required to address these factors towards achieving equity, active allyship and visibility is also important to support and encourage the next generation of women and girls to pursue research careers. This article collection includes 5 original research papers, 2 brief research reports and 1 review article demonstrating a diversity of neonatology-related research led by women. Depicolzuane et al. reviewed and presented a summary of animal and translational studies, and clinical observations on the role of lung surfactant protein A in lung function and importantly in lung protection from both infectious and non-infectious agents. Surfactant protein A has a unique role in the lung through its interactions with lung macrophages where it impacts the activity of alveolar macrophages in response to injurious agents or stimuli. Interestingly, surfactant protein A also has a role in control of the in utero environment."
"Population- and sex-specific sensitivity of the marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa to metal exposure Gammarus Fossarum; Potamopyrgus Antipodarum; Bioassay The sensitivity to contaminants of natural populations varies greatly depending on their historical exposure and on the sex of the individual. These factors result in great uncertainty in ecotoxicological risk assessments and challenge the protection of marine biodiversity. This study investigated the role of background pollution in the environment in shaping the sensitivity of males and females of the common marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa to the common trace marine pollutant, copper (Cu). Female and male amphipods were collected from two sites: Geelong (the polluted site) and Clifton Springs (the clean site). Amphipods were exposed to Cu treatments of 0, 50, 100, and 250 Î¼g/L for 10 days, followed by a 10-day recovery period. Cu-exposed males from Geelong showed a reduction in feeding rate at a higher Cu concentration than males from Clifton Springs, suggesting that they have a higher tolerance to Cu than males from Clifton Springs. This can be explained by their higher base level of metallothioneins (MTs) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), the key physiological responses for detoxification and defence against damages from Cu toxicity. Males showed a higher tolerance to Cu than females. This pattern was similar in both populations, which may be associated with a higher level of GST. During the recovery period, only males from Geelong fully recovered to the control level. Our results emphasize the importance of considering population- and sex-specific sensitivity of invertebrates to contaminants in ecotoxicological risk assessments."
"SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines: Where Are We Now? Nasopharyngeal Swabs; Serologic Tests; COVID-19 The best and safest way to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is by using vaccination to generate widespread immunity. The urgent need to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines was met with unprecedented speed and action from the global community. There are now 289 vaccines in the development pipeline. More remarkably, there are 20 publicly available vaccines, and more than 3.3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across 180 countries. This is just the beginning of our fight against the pandemic. Even at the current vaccination rate, it could take years to vaccinate the world's population; many high-income countries are focusing on their needs, whereas the poorer nations are waiting for vaccines. There is still much that we do not understand about immunity to this new disease, and we will have to contend with the emerging variants. In this commentary, we describe the current status of COVID-19 vaccine development and provide insights into how the development and approvals happened so quickly. We discuss the clinical trial data that led to rapid emergency use authorization and the many challenges of global rollout. We also comment on some of the key unanswered questions and future directions for COVID-19 vaccine development and deployment."
"Sense of belonging in second-year undergraduate students: the value of extracurricular activities Community Colleges; Financial Aid; Enrollment This article presents empirical evidence on how second-year studentsâ€™ sense of belonging and overall experience can be improved through a carefully designed extracurricular activity as an effective approach to practically integrate academic and social dimensions of belongingness. Data were collected at multiple points for this exploratory study that involved a self-administered questionnaire survey with 50 participants followed by a post-activity focus group to explore the effect of cultural awareness on second-year studentsâ€™ belongingness. Informed by Tintoâ€™s student integration model and extant belonging literature, our findings highlight the importance of all three elements of belongingnessâ€“social, academic and informalâ€“to co-exist in the design of the extracurricular activity for effectively addressing several challenges associated with second-year undergraduate studentsâ€™ belonging, overall experience and retention. Our study aligns with the best practice approach of ensuring a connection between an extracurricular activity, course material and skill development for a globalised workforce. The study offers important implications for universities about how to benefit from this approach in seeking to meet the distinctive needs of second-year students and developing well-targeted programmes to increase their satisfaction and academic achievements, and ultimately retentionâ€“a weakness still seen in the literature."
"Maximum piezoelectricity in a few unit-cell thick planar ZnO – A liquid metal-based synthesis approach Nanogenerators; Piezoelectric; Energy Harvesting Synthesizing two dimensional (2D) nanomaterials with controlled sub-nanometer thicknesses from non-layered crystals presents both significant challenges and vast opportunities. However, mechanical exfoliation techniques and physical/wet chemical deposition processes are widely disadvantageous for applicability to non-layered structures. Here we have utilized a simple self-limiting approach to prepare large sheets of 2D zinc oxide (ZnO) at the metal-melt/air interface. These ultra-thin sheets demonstrated highly crystalline hexagonal structures. The specific ZnO hexagonal sheet thickness and its interaction with the substrate were found to have a critical impact on d33. This unusual structure resulted in an exceptionally high out of plane piezoelectricity, yielding a giant value of 80 Â± 0.8 pm/V at 2.5 unit-cell thickness for d33, which is 5 Zn-O layers in the wurtzite crystal. This out of plane piezoelectricity value is approximately 8 times larger than that of the value for bulk ZnO. Theoretical studies were carried out to elucidate the impact of the thickness and the substrate's role on the polarization of the layers. The existence of a large piezoelectricity offered by the synergy of the substrate and specific thickness of ultrathin films offers the opportunity for other groups of potentially piezoelectric materials to be explored."
"Options for Improved Treatment of Saline Wastewater From Fish and Shellfish Processing Activated Sludge; Batch Reactors; Salinity The rapid growth of the aquaculture industry over recent decades, with annual production reaching 94.6 million tonnes in 2018 has resulted in a significant increase in saline wastewater following the use of seawater in both fish and shellfish production and processing. This wastewater contains high concentrations of nutrients, organic compounds, and total nitrogen, resulting in the requirement for significant treatment prior to discharge to meet environmental regulations, which are becoming more stringent. The infrastructure and running costs associated with physico-chemical treatment approaches are generally higher than the implementation of biological approaches; the latter represents both an economic and sustainable technology. However, salinity represents a significant inhibitor to microbial activity, affecting the efficacy of the biological treatment of wastewater. This review aims to 1) identify the major biodegradable components in saline fish wastewater that may result in deleterious effects upon discharge, 2) discuss the current methods used for the treatment of fish processing wastewaters, and 3) identify opportunities for improved processes to be utilised and identify gaps in knowledge that require further research. Total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total nitrogen (TN) were found to be the most prevalent components in fish effluent. High concentrations of TSS and TN are likely due to the protein content. One method for reducing the environmental impact of the treated wastewater is to enhance nutrient removal (TSS, TN, BOD) through process modification, leading to an increase in active proteolytic activity. Bioaugmentation using immobilised, saline-tolerant proteases or halophilic, protease-producing microorganisms have both shown significant potential in laboratory studies in reducing both the COD and TN content of fish processing wastewater to below discharge limits and therefore may represent commercial options for future treatment processes."
"Review: Biomaterial systems to resolve brain inflammation after traumatic injury Astrocytes; Neuroglia; Central Nervous System The inflammatory response within the central nervous system (CNS) is a tightly regulated cascade of events which is a balance of both cytotoxic and cytotrophic effects which determine the outcome of an injury. The two effects are inextricably linked, particularly in traumatic brain injury or stroke, where permanent dysfunction is often observed. Chronic brain inflammation is a key barrier to regeneration. This is considered a toxic, growth inhibitory mechanism; yet, the inflammatory response must also be considered as a mechanism that can be exploited as protective and reparative. Repurposing this complex response is the challenge for tissue engineers: to design treatments to repair and regenerate damaged tissue after brain insult. Astrocytes are important cells within the CNS which play a key role after traumatic brain injury. A comprehensive understanding of their functions - both cytotrophic and cytotoxic - will enable designed materials and drug delivery approaches for improved treatment options post traumatic injury. Understanding, evaluating, and designing biomaterials that match the healthy neural environment to temporally alter the inflammatory cascade represent a promise neural tissue engineering strategy to optimise repair and regeneration after injury."
"Entrepreneurial drivers, barriers and enablers of computing students: gendered perspectives from an Australian and UK university Entrepreneurial Intention; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship This paper investigates computing studentsâ€™ entrepreneurial intentions, motivations, recognisable barriers and encouragements towards entrepreneurship, with a focus on gender. Two universities, one in Australia and one in the UK (n = 247), were used as locations for the research to consider two distinct contexts. In each university there were similarly high levels of interest in entrepreneurship among computing students, however some significant differences in responses were found, especially between male and female participants. Job flexibility was a strong motivation for the UK-based female participants; while female participants at the Australian university identified internal barriers (such as lack of confidence and experience). Enablers to entrepreneurial activity were identified, including access to incubators and academic support. Directing such support towards computing students, while recognising gender differences, could increase interest in, and take-up of, entrepreneurship.

"Enhanced Photovoltaic Efficiency via Control of Self-Assembly in Cyanopyridone-Based Oligothiophene Donors Polymer Solar Cells; Polymers; Organic Photovoltaics The optoelectronic properties of functional Ï€-conjugated organic materials are affected by their ability to self-assemble within thin films of devices. There are limited reports that demonstrate the positive impact of self-assembly on the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells. Here, we demonstrate that hydrogen-bonded supramolecular arrays of a cyanopyridone-based oligothiophene donor, CP6, show notable improvement in photovoltaic performance upon self-assembly into a nanofibrous network. The honeycomb-like blend network exhibited higher hole mobility, leading to efficient charge generation and transport. The photovoltaic performance of CP6 was superior to that of two structural analogues, CP5 and CP1, and was attributed to the enhanced capability of CP6 to self-assemble into a film morphology favorable for BHJ devices. The BHJ devices comprising CP6 and the conventional fullerene acceptor (PC71BM) exhibited an efficiency of 7.26%, which is greater than that of CP5 (5.19%) and CP1 (3.11%) and is among the best-performing, cyanopyridone-based oligothiophene donors described to date."
"Walking The Talk: from theory to practice in delivering community based design education Scenography; Summer House; Bauhaus Dessau This paper discusses the model of â€˜walking the talkâ€™, when running design studios based on the â€˜live projectsâ€™ model within a university setting for vulnerable communities. This model is examined through exploring emerging humanitarian and community-based design approaches in architectural education. It is tested through two case studies of design studios in Mostar and Beirut, led by the author between 1998 and 2002. Lessons from these community-engagement studios are applied through a third case study, a design project for a disability day-care centre in Hoi An, Vietnam. The project was led by RMIT University students and staff between 2009-2011 and built in April 2012."
"An experimental study of brine recirculation in humidification-dehumidification desalination of seawater Solar Still; Humidifiers; Desalination Humidification-dehumidification (HDH) desalination systems can work with highly saline water feed. However, rejected brine volume from HDH systems is a critical issue of brine management these systems that can result in catastrophic environmental impacts. To minimize the rejected brine volume and increase the overall water recovery ratio in the HDH desalination system, a brine recirculation method is implemented by considering a bleeding flow of the concentrated brine stream. This enables the system to work at steady state high salinity feed. Experiments are conducted for feed salinity of range of 10-30% to investigate the method applicabilty. An open-air water-heated HDH desalination system with direct contact dehumidifier is experimentally examined under varied feed salinities to evaluate the viability and thermal performance of the proposed brine recirculation method. An analytical model is presented which can predict flow rates of bleeding and feed seawater at different water production rates. The results indicate that an overall recovery ratio of nearly 88% at a salinity of 30% can be achieved with the implementation of the proposed brine recirculation method. This method can significantly facilitate brine management related issues of HDH desalination systems by minimizing the rejected brine volume."
"Si: Survivability under overheating: The impact of regional and global climate change on the vulnerable and low-income population Heat Wave; Climate Change; Distributed Lag The present special issue discusses three significant challenges of the built environment, namely regional and global climate change, vulnerability, and survivability under the changing climate. Synergies between local climate change, energy consumption of buildings and energy poverty, and health risks highlight the necessity to develop mitigation strategies to counterbalance overheating impacts. The studies presented here assess the underlying issues related to urban overheating. Further, the impacts of temperature extremes on the low-income population and increased morbidity and mortality have been discussed. The increasing intensity, duration, and frequency of heatwaves due to human-caused climate change is shown to affect underserved populations. Thus, housing policies on resident exposure to intra-urban heat have been assessed. Finally, opportunities to mitigate urban overheating have been proposed and discussed."
"Handling complexity in animal and plant science research—From single to functional traits: Are we there yet? Biomarkers; Hippuric Acid; Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy The current knowledge of the main factors governing livestock, crop and plant quality as well as yield in different species is incomplete. For example, this can be evidenced by the persistence of benchmark crop varieties for many decades in spite of the gains achieved over the same period. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that molecular breeding based on DNA markers has led to advances in breeding (animal and crops). However, these advances are not in the way that it was anticipated initially by the researcher in the field. According to several scientists, one of the main reasons for this was related to the evidence that complex target traits such as grain yield, composition or nutritional quality depend on multiple factors in addition to genetics. Therefore, some questions need to be asked: are the current approaches in molecular genetics the most appropriate to deal with complex traits such as yield or quality? Are the current tools for phenotyping complex traits enough to differentiate among genotypes? Do we need to change the way that data is collected and analysed?"
"The effect of particle size on nanodiamond fluorescence and colloidal properties in biological media Nanodiamonds; Detonation; Carbon Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) are extremely photostable markers and nanoscale sensors, which are increasingly used in biomedical applications. Nanoparticle size is a critical parameter in the majority of these applications. Yet, the effect of particle size on FND's fluorescence and colloidal properties is not well understood today. Here, we investigate the fluorescence and colloidal stability of commercially available high-pressure high-temperature FNDs containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in biological media. Unconjugated FNDs in sizes ranging between 10 nm and 140 nm with an oxidized surface are studied using dynamic light scattering and fluorescence spectroscopy. We determine their colloidal stability in water, fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium and complete media. The FNDs' relative fluorescence brightness, the NV charge-state, and the FND fluorescence against media autofluorescence are analyzed as a function of FND size. Our results will enable researchers in biology and beyond to identify the most promising FND particle size for their application."
"Predicted environmental concentration and fate of the top 10 most dispensed Australian prescription pharmaceuticals PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs A basic environmental risk assessment was carried out for the top 10 dispensed pharmaceuticals in Melbourne, Australia, in contrast to the more commonly assessed measure of the most used drugs by physical mass. This allowed for the evaluation of compounds that had not previously been the subject of risk assessment. Estimations of the possible fate and behaviour of the target pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants were also made. The predicted removal rates of most drugs within standard sewage treatment were expected to be low, with the exception of the statins, which had high removal rates. Each pharmaceutical was predicted to be present in Melbourne wastewater at the nanogram per litre range or lower. All compounds were predicted to be of low toxicity risk, although it was not possible to model mixture effects. Atorvastatin and Irbesartan were also found to possess the potential to possibly bioaccumulate in the aquatic food chain but not to the extent that would require regulation or labelling."
"Enhancing the coordination of housing supports for individuals leaving institutional settings Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease Key points Transitions out of institutional settingsâ€”inpatient mental health care, residential substance use services, out-of-home care (OHC), and correctionsâ€”are associated with significant risks of housing insecurity, which can be greatly reduced by more effective service coordination. More effective service coordination is especially critical between separate service systems (e.g. housing, mental health, substance use, family services and corrections). Enhanced coordination between these sectors is crucial to reduce the risks of housing insecurity for individuals leaving institutional settings. There is considerable variation in the ways housing issues are managed within these settings, and discrepancies in the quality and duration of housing support available to individuals when they leave. As the complexity of service provision grows, there is evidence that service coordination roles can effectively promote service integration. To be effective, staff in these roles should have clear responsibilities to identify and maintain formal practices of service coordination with a strong focus on maintaining transparency and accountability. There is emerging evidence that service coordination roles should be supplemented and supported by greater involvement of â€˜peerâ€™, â€˜consumerâ€™ and/or â€˜service userâ€™ representatives in service coordination. â€˜Best practiceâ€™ programs around the country indicate how services can be more effectively coordinated to support improved housing outcomes for individuals leaving institutional settings."
"Conditional convergence in per capita carbon emissions since 1900 Income Convergence; Structural Funds; European Union This study examines conditional convergence in relative per capita carbon dioxide emissions by using the recently developed Residual Augmented Least Squares-Lagrange Multiplier (RALS-LM) unit root test procedure that allows for endogenously determined structural breaks. Utilising a sample of 44 developed and developing countries dating back to the beginning of the 20th century, the null hypothesis of a unit root in relative per capita carbon dioxide emissions is soundly rejected, lending support to the conditional convergence hypothesis. Also, an examination of the pre and post-World War II suggests that convergence in relative per capita carbon dioxide emissions is more pronounced over the post-World War II period as opposed to the pre-World War II period."
"Estimation of the healthcare waste generation during COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh Environmental Pollution; Medical Waste; COVID-19 COVID-19 pandemic-borne wastes imposed a severe threat to human lives as well as the total environment. Improper handling of these wastes increases the possibility of future transmission. Therefore, immediate actions are required from both local and international authorities to mitigate the amount of waste generation and ensure proper disposal of these wastes, especially for low-income and developing countries where solid waste management is challenging. In this study, an attempt is made to estimate healthcare waste generated during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. This study includes infected, ICU, deceased, isolated and quarantined patients as the primary sources of medical waste. Results showed that COVID-19 medical waste from these patients was 658.08 tons in March 2020 and increased to 16,164.74 tons in April 2021. A top portion of these wastes was generated from infected and quarantined patients. Based on survey data, approximate daily usage of face masks and hand gloves is also determined. Probable waste generation from COVID-19 confirmatory tests and vaccination has been simulated. Finally, several guidelines are provided to ensure the country's proper disposal and management of COVID-related wastes."
"Implications of climate change for shipping: Ports and supply chains Decision Making; Foresight; Alternative Futures Ports are an important economic actorâ€”at local, national, and international scalesâ€”that have been identified as being vulnerable to future changes to the climate. This paper details the findings from an international review of state-of-the-art knowledge concerning climate risks, and adaptation responses, for ports and their supply chains. Evidence from both academic and gray literature indicates that there has already been major damage and disruption to ports across the world from climate-related hazards and that such impacts are projected to increase in the years and decades to come. Findings indicate that while a substantialâ€”and growingâ€”body of scientific evidence on coastal risks and potential adaptation options is acting as a stimulus for port authorities to explicitly consider the risks for their assets and operations, only a notable few have actually made the next step toward implementing adaptation strategies. This paper concludes by putting forward constructive recommendations for the sector and suggestions for research to address remaining knowledge gaps. It emphasizes a call for collaboration between the research and practice communities, as well as the need to engage a broad range of stakeholders in the adaptation planning process. This article is categorized under: Assessing Impacts of Climate Change > Evaluating Future Impacts of Climate Change."
"A data-driven analytical roadmap to a sustainable 2030 in South Korea based on optimal renewable microgrids Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems Combined technological, economic, sociological, and environmental (TESE) models can play a unique role in leveraging renewable energies and supporting sustainable development. Yet, a multi-aspect TESE model has never been used in Korea to adapt to climate change through sustainable energy policies. This comprehensive TESE study addresses several sustainability challenges in the Korean energy sector. First, demand electricity is predicted using four deep and stacked neural networks to develop a smart demand-based model. Second, optimal hybrid renewable microgrids (HRMGs) are simulated at 17 sites to evaluate five renewable energy sources in three scenarios. Third, hybrid assessment results are clustered using a K-means algorithm to generate hybrid renewable energy maps for South Korea. Fourth, the TESE model is analyzed with more than 13 variables using a cascading multi-criteria decision-making approach to prorate a budget and develop a prioritized roadmap for a sustainable 2030 in Korea. Fifth, a stochastic linear mathematical model is developed to propose a sustainable energy policy that considers the water-energy-carbon nexus. The results show that a convolutional neural network can efficiently predict sequential demand electricity (R2 = 98.79%), with respective biogas, solar, hydrostatic, wind, and hydrokinetic energy fractions of 45.7%, 34.5%, 14%, 5.78%, and 0.01% under optimal conditions in Korea. The present free market-based policies are recommended to be revised in favor of domestic production of renewable energy facilities if new jobs can be created for more than $7500 each, and the carbon penalty cost can be kept below $83/ton CO2-eq in Korea."
"Meeting the demands for social justice through visual arts in the curriculum Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work Ten years have passed since the first meetings of Arts advisors to start identifying the priorities and approaches that the Arts may take when formalised into a national curriculum structure. Now the time has come for reviewing the past to inform the future. Now is the time for reviewing, interrogating and challenging the Australian Curriculum: The Arts for a socially just world. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the process of positioning Visual Arts in the curriculum and the role of Visual Arts to meet social justice imperatives. The paper presents a critical discussion of the Arts and a critical consideration of my role in the writing of the shaping papers. This approach allows an identification of some highlights and challenges along the way. The more philosophical part of the discussion addresses the politics of curriculum and the politics of knowledge through Visual Arts, as it situates the underpinning principles of aesthetics and meaning-making through the Arts. The paper shows how acts of hospitality disrupt practices of domination and marginalisation; and how such acts activate ethical practices of social justice in the Arts, and Visual Arts in particular. The paper claims that Visual Arts as a learning area has a potent role in reflecting and shaping attitudes to social justice, and that education in Visual Arts may contribute to authenticating and legitimising oneâ€™s place in the world based upon credible ethical foundations."
"Design of an evidence-based diversity workshop to support participation of older people in their community care Pharmacy Students; Interprofessional Relations; Health Occupations Diversity is what makes a person unique, with the intersection of diversity characteristics potentially a strength or a barrier to accessing healthcare, and thereby affecting health and well-being outcomes. Many older people with diverse needs are not accessing appropriate services to meet their needs, leading to suboptimal health and well-being. Community aged care workers are at the frontline, working with diverse older people with complex needs; yet there is a dearth of training available in this sphere. This paper outlines the development and pilot evaluation of a diversity training workshop for managers and frontline community aged care workers. The aim of the workshop was to empower the workforce to support increased participation of older people with diverse needs in their own care, to ultimately lead to their improved health and well-being. Workshop development was underpinned by sound education principles, a competency framework and research evidence. First iteration of the workshop underwent pilot testing with three groups, two in metropolitan Melbourne (n = 31) and one in regional Victoria (n = 10), Australia. Feedback was gathered via an independent observer (field notes), pre- and post-workshop surveys, and phone interviews with participants 3-month post-workshop. Pilot data and feedback informed changes to workshop content (type of knowledge, application of knowledge and skills), workshop structure and androgogical (adult learning) approach. An evidence-informed diversity training workshop was developed through an iterative process, with the aim of enhancing knowledge, skills and attitudes of community aged care workers. This approach has developed a workshop that aims to better meet the needs of an aged care workforce, so that they may better support older people with diverse needs to increase engagement and participation in their care, optimizing their health and well-being."
"Matching symbiotic associations of an endangered orchid to habitat to improve conservation outcomes Germination; Tulasnella; Cephalanthera Background and Aims: An understanding of mycorrhizal variation, orchid seed germination temperature and the effect of co-occurring plant species could be critical for optimizing conservation translocations of endangered plants with specialized mycorrhizal associations. Methods: Focusing on the orchid Thelymitra epipactoides, we isolated mycorrhizal fungi from ten plants within each of three sites; Shallow Sands Woodland (SSW), Damp Heathland (DH) and Coastal Heathland Scrub (CHS). Twenty-seven fungal isolates were tested for symbiotic germination under three 24 h temperature cycles: 12 Â°C for 16 h-16 Â°C for 8 h, 16 Â°C for 16 h-24 Â°C for 8 h or 27 Â°C constant. Fungi were sequenced using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), nuclear large subunit 1 (nLSU1), nLSU2 and mitochondrial large rRNA gene (mtLSU). Orchids were grown to maturity and co-planted with each of ten associated plant species in a glasshouse experiment with tuber width measured at 12 months after co-planting. Key Results: Two Tulasnella fungal lineages were isolated and identified by phylogenetic analyses, operational taxonomic unit 1 (OTU1) and 'T. asymmetrica'. Fungal lineages were specific to sites and did not co-occur. OTU1 (from the SSW site) germinated seed predominantly at 12-16 Â°C (typical of autumn-winter temperature) whereas 'T. asymmetrica' (from the DH and CHS sites) germinated seed across all three temperature ranges. There was no difference in the growth of adult orchids germinated with different OTUs. There was a significant reduction in tuber size of T. epipactoides when co-planted with six of the commonly co-occurring plant species. Conclusions: We found that orchid fungal lineages and their germination temperature can change with habitat, and established that translocation sites can be optimized with knowledge of co-occurring plant interactions. For conservation translocations, particularly under a changing climate, we recommend that plants should be grown with mycorrhizal fungi tailored to the recipient site."
"How do sporting organisations conceptualise and operationalise the prevention of violence against women? Sexual Assault; Bystander; Crime Victims Sport settings have great potential to influence social change and are therefore important locations to engage in the prevention of violence against women. The following study draws on in-depth interviews with 16 stakeholders who have been involved with the implementation of prevention programmes within competitive/team sport settings. A qualitative thematic analysis of the interviews was undertaken to examine how sporting organisations understand, strategise and practise prevention work in Australia and New Zealand. Implications for long-term changes in the prevention of violence against women are discussed with reference to key prevention actions and frameworks."
"Recycling waste plastics in roads: A life-cycle assessment study using primary data Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens The present study investigates â€“ from an environmental perspective â€“ the processes that lead to the conversion of waste plastics into recycled plastic pellets to be used either as an additive (wet method) or as a replacement of natural aggregate (dry method) in the production of asphalt mixes. Data from recycling facilities in Victoria, Australia, were collected and used as the basis for a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) study. Analyses were conducted by considering several replacement ratios of virgin material by its recycled counterpart in the so-called wet and dry method. A case study considering the production of recycled-plastic asphalt to be applied in the construction of a typical surface layer of a road in Victoria was evaluated. In general, the results show that recycling plastics as a polymer for bitumen modification and as a synthetic aggregate replacement in asphalt mixes has the potential to be environmentally advantageous compared to their virgin counterpart (i.e. virgin polymers and natural quarry aggregates)."
"Quantification of seasonal photo-induced formation of reactive intermediates in a municipal sewage lagoon upon sunlight exposure Dissolved Organic Matter; Photodegradation; Water Photochemically produced reactive oxygen species in wastewater lagoons upon sunlight exposure are important in the attenuation of emerging contaminants (ECs). The production of reactive radicals in wastewater lagoons depends on both environmental factors and the composition of effluent organic matter (EfOM) in the wastewater. Knowing the steady state concentrations of these reactive species produced in a particular lagoon wastewater is critical to the prediction of the persistence and attenuation of ECs in that sunlit wastewater treatment lagoon. This study quantified the formation of four photochemically produced reactive intermediates (PPRIs): hydroxyl radical, carbonate radical, singlet oxygen, and triplet excited state EfOM in 11 samples collected from a municipal wastewater lagoon over a full year. The temporal distribution of these key PPRIs in the lagoon under investigation was determined in relation to sunlight irradiance, wastewater composition and temperature. Greater sunlight intensity led to greater PPRI production over the year. Increasing wastewater temperature from 12 to 25 Â°C led to greater production of singlet oxygen, a moderate decrease in hydroxyl radical and increase in triplet excited state EfOM, and minimal impact on carbonate radical production. The optical properties of the lagoon wastewater of Napierian absorption coefficient (A300) and E2:E3 ratio could be used as indicators of the formation of singlet oxygen (Pearson's r = 0.79) and triplet excited EfOM (Pearson's r = 0.76) produced upon solar irradiation. The concentration of carbonate radical formed was strongly correlated to the nitrate level in the wastewater (Pearson's r = 0.85). The findings could be used for modelling the seasonal sunlight-induced photolysis process of ECs during lagoon-based wastewater treatment, with a view to optimising the treatment process, predicting the efficacy of EC removal, and risk assessment of the treated water."
"Beyond the mainstream: Diversity leadership and leading diversity Feminism; Identity Work; Organization Studies Who runs social work education? What can be said about the representation of diverse groups in leadership in social work education? Leadership theory has for some time recognized more marginal or so-called â€˜standpointâ€™ perspectives, in particular gender and â€˜raceâ€™, that take up a lens beyond the mainstream assumptions of white, male, western leadership. Nevertheless, such theorizing in relation to race/ethnicity and difference has largely been conceptualized as deficit to the white, male norm and accordingly focused on the barriers to inclusion and engagement of minority perspectives. This tendency omits to consider the insights and contributions beyond the mainstream perspectives can bring to leadership styles and strategies. This chapter considers diversity in leadership and leading diversity as two key dimensions. It considers the race/ethnicity axis, and the ways it can shape and craft the perceptions of leaders, the ways in which leadership is enacted and how this relates to actions aimed at leading diversity."
The dragon versus the kangaroo: perceptions of Chinese and Australian influence and development assistance in Vanuatu Aid; Official Development Assistance; International Cooperation Chinaâ€™s engagement within the South Pacific has increased dramatically in recent years mainly through significant increases in development assistance. Development assistance is provided to address humanitarian needs but to also secure national interests of the donor. This paper examines the extent and nature of Australiaâ€™s and Chinaâ€™s influence in Vanuatu from the perspectives of the Ni-Vanuatu people using new data. China is perceived as having the most influence in the country despite Australiaâ€™s development assistance being viewed far more positively. Support for infrastructure is the most important factor contributing to a positive image for both countries. Perceptions of land grabbing are the main factor contributing to negative images. Regional differences in perceptions of Australia and China across Vanuatu also exist.
"A modified novel blade configuration proposal for a more efficient VAWT using CFD tools Rotor; Solidity; Hydromechanics It is a priority to generate affordable and reliable energy with higher participation of renewable energy technologies into the global energy mix to provide efficient sustainable energy services for everyone, highlighting the need to focus on vulnerable communities in developing countries with limited or no access to electricity. Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) are widely used for renewable electricity generation. In that order, Savonius rotor, being a VAWT, is commonly used because of its numerous advantages for small scale generation. Thus, wind energy research on a modified Savonius rotor might be a feasible solution for powering vulnerable communities with no access to the grid. Hence, this paper shows how to improve the performance of a conventional Savonius blade by introducing a novel configuration without expensive and complex modifications on the geometry. For that purpose, a Cm and Cp coefficients comparison between 13 proposed scenarios against the conventional configuration to define a novel one, with better performance is carried out through a 2D computational fluid dynamic analysis by using Ansys Fluent 18.0. The SST k-Ï‰ model is selected as the turbulent model. As a result, a higher performance Savonius novel rotor configuration is identified with 17.81% improvement over the conventional configuration."
"Technological, nutritional and sensory properties of pasta fortified with agro-industrial by-products: a review Noodles; Pasta; Flour Reducing food waste is a priority to move towards more sustainable food systems. Since agro-food by-products are often rich in healthy compounds, such as fibre, phytochemicals, protein, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals, the waste valorisation could move through their transformation into ingredients useful for the formulation of functional foods. Pasta is a staple food widely consumed all over the world representing an optimal carrier for nutrients delivery. The incorporation of ingredients of a high added value obtained by agro-industrial by-products in pasta can improve its nutritional value and provides several health benefits. At the same time, the inclusion of new ingredients could modify the physical, chemical and textural properties determining the change of the organoleptic characteristics of fortified pasta, affecting its acceptability. Thus, the preparation of new pasta formulations with high nutritional properties, good technological and sensory characteristics represents a challenge for the food industry."
"Plasma-induced FeSiAl@Al2O3@SiO2 core–shell structure for exceptional microwave absorption and anti-oxidation at high temperature Shielding; Effective Bandwidth; Electric Network Analyzers Structural and chemical stability is the key factors of microwave absorbers for their applications in case of high-temperature oxidation. In this study, a plasma-induced method is developed to get a multistrata core-shell structure of FeSiAl@Al2O3@SiO2 with bifunctional performances of microwave absorption and anti-oxidation. Within a dense microstructure, the Al2O3 and SiO2 ceramic shell layers mitigate oxygen transport to prevent corrosion at high temperature. Consequently, the magnetic FeSiAl core is well-protected against oxidation up to 1279 Â°C in air and exhibits excellent microwave absorption property. In particular, dense ceramic layers effectively reduce the permittivity of FeSiAl without losing permeability. Furthermore, the novel FSA@GCLs microstructures are enriched with multiple interfaces to favor the interfacial polarization and vast internal scattering probabilities. Because of the strong synergistic magnetic-dielectric effects, the multistrata core-shell structure of FeSiAl@Al2O3@SiO2 owns a minimum reflection loss of âˆ’46.29 dB at 16.93 GHz and its wide bandwidth (with an RL value of âˆ’10 dB) particularly acquire 7.33 GHz in the frequency range of 10.14â€“17.45 GHz. The highly stable multistrata core-shell opens up the opportunities of extending the microwave absorption as well as anti-oxidation applications."
"Mobile moralities: Ethical consumption in the digital realm Fair Trade; Global Value Chains; Global Production Networks Ethical consumption, as a realm of production and exchange, a framework for purchasing decisions and as political activism, is now well established in a range of nations. As a politics, it points to an interconnected but divergent set of concerns centred on issues of environmental sustainability, local and global economic and social justice, and community and individual wellbeing. While the subject of sustained critique, not least because of its apparent privileging of the â€˜consumerâ€™ as the locus of change, ethical consumption has garnered increasing attention. This is most recently evident in the development and widening use of â€˜ethical consumption appsâ€™ for mobile devices. These apps allow the user to both access ethical information on products and, potentially, to connect with a broader politics of consumption. However, in entering the digital realm, ethical consumption also becomes embroiled in the complexities of digital technocultures and their ability to allow users of apps to be connected to each other, potentially building communities of interest and/or activism. This article explores this emerging intersection of the ethical and the digital. It examines whether such digital affordances affect the way ethical consumption itself may be conceived and pursued. Does the ethical consumption app work to collectivise or individualise, help to focus or fragment, speak of timidity, or potential in relation to an oppositional politics of consumption? In confronting these issues, this article suggests that contemporary ethical consumption apps â€“ while full of political potential â€“ remain problematic in that the turn to the digital has tended, so far, to accentuate the already individualising tendencies within a politics of ethical consumption. This speaks also, however, to a similar problematic in the politics of digital technocultures; the use of the digital does not automatically enable â€“ merely through greater connectivity and information availability â€“ forms of radical politics."
"A Comparison of Assessment Methods for Engineering Students’ Understanding of Sustainability Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Developing the ability of students to think critically and systemically about sustainability issues is assessed in a variety of ways in different disciplines and institutions but there are few reports in the literature about what methods are the most successful. This paper discusses a range of assessment methods and characterises them in terms of Bloomâ€™s taxonomy of cognitive processes. Examinations are efficient, standardisable and objective but are not suitable for measuring sustainability learning. They promote surface learning and fail to measure higher order cognitive processes characteristic of sustainability competence. Project based learning (PjBL) is a common approach in engineering disciplines as it mirrors engineering work. PjBL assessment tasks such as reports and presentations can be marked using taxonomies such as the SOLO taxonomy which measure the higher order cognitive processes that are required for sustainability competence. However, markers need a high level of skill to mark reliability with rubrics based on the SOLO taxonomy. Graphical tools such as concept maps are also effective in measuring higher order cognitive processes."
"An integrated approach for the restoration of Australian temperate grasslands invaded by Nassella trichotoma Flupropanate; Nassella Trichotoma; Tussock Grasslands Invasive plants are considered to be one of the biggest threats to environmental assets, and once established, they can be immensely difficult to control. Nassella trichotoma is an aggressive, perennial grass species, and is considered to be one of the most economically damaging weeds to grazing systems due to its unpalatability, as well as being one of the leading causes of biodiversity loss in grassland communities. This species produces high density seedbanks that rapidly respond to disturbance events. Despite control programs being developing in Australia since the 1930s, this species is still widespread throughout south-east Australia, indicating that a new management approach is critical to control this Weed of National Significance at the landscape scale. The present study explored the effect of 12 different combinations of herbicide, fire, a second application of herbicide, grazing exclusion, tillage and broadcasting seeds in order to reduce the above and below-ground density of N. trichotoma. A control treatment was also included. The results were assessed using a Hierarchy analysis, whereby treatments of increasing complexity were compared for their efficacy in reducing N. trichotoma cover and seedbank density, while simultaneously increasing the establishment of the broadcast species. Whilst all integrated treatments effectively reduced N. trichotomaâ€™s seedbank, the treatments that included fire performed significantly better at simultaneously reducing N. trichotoma and increasing the establishment of broadcasted seeds. Overall, the integration of herbicide, fire and broadcasting native seeds was observed to provide the most economically feasible management strategy for the landscape scale restoration of a degraded temperate grassland dominated by N. trichotoma."
"A review on the regional collaboration of power utilisation in South Asia Energy; Energy Poverty; Fuelwood Economic prosperity and development in South Asia are significantly restricted by the insufficient power supply. Inadequate indigenous energy resource of each South Asian nation is not enough to generate power for meeting the growing demand. Moreover, the availability of limited indigenous energy resources differs from one country to another in South Asia. In addition to availability variation of indigenous energy sources, the climate conditions also vary resulting in variable power demand and power generation capacity. This paper reviews the current power generation capacity of all eight nations of South Asia. It highlights the bilateral and multilateral collaboration opportunities in power generation and the need for cross boarder power trade among South Asian nations. The review emphasises that the bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation will allow overcoming regional power shortage and augmenting collective energy security, economic and political integration."
"Revisiting the intermetallic phases in high-pressure die-cast Mg–4Al–4Ce and Mg–4Al–4La alloys Magnesium Alloys; Precipitation Hardening; Mechanical Properties Mgâ€“Alâ€“RE based alloys such as AE42 (Mgâ€“4Alâ€“2RE) and AE44 (Mgâ€“4Alâ€“4RE) are commonly known to contain A111RE3 and Al2RE intermetallic phases, with the former being predominant. However, it was found recently that the predominant intermetallic phase in a gravity-cast Mgâ€“4.5Alâ€“6.3La alloy is not A111La3 but a new ternary phase with the composition of (Al,Mg)3La. In this work, the intermetallic phases in high-pressure die-cast Mgâ€“4Alâ€“4Ce and Mgâ€“4Alâ€“4La alloys are thus re-examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is shown that the predominant intermetallic phase is A111Ce3 in the die-cast Mgâ€“4Alâ€“4Ce alloy but (Al,Mg)3La in the die-cast Mgâ€“4Alâ€“4La alloy. Both A111Ce3 and (Al,Mg)3La remain thermally stable upon annealing at 500 Â°C for 100 h and are most likely equilibrium phases in each alloy. This study provides strong evidence that the formation of intermetallic phases in Mgâ€“Alâ€“RE alloys is affected by the choice of individual RE elements."
"Growing Australia’s smaller cities to better manage population growth Regional Development; Leadership; Governance Arrangement Key points This report examines the capacity of Australiaâ€™s smaller cities to accommodate a larger percentage of the nationâ€™s population growth. It finds that: In the absence of purposeful action, a growing percentage of Australians will live in our largest cities in 20 years. Most immigrants move to the largest metropolitan areas, and a fundamental reshaping of our immigration system is needed if this pattern is to be reversed. Change, however, is possible. Many moving to smaller cities come from other parts of non-metropolitan regions, although the processes of sea change and tree change have reshaped this pattern over the past 20 years. Young people commonly leave smaller cities and regional areas for education and employment opportunities. There is a weak link between employment growth in smaller cities and population growth and the direction of the relationship varies from place to place. Much of the employment growth in these places has been in low paid employment, and there is a need to reverse this trend and increase the mix of industries growing in these places. Policies to attract more Australians to smaller cities need to focus on the Aspirational Changers segment of the population (21 per cent of the total) and the Lifestyle Maximisers (54 per cent). There are viable policy options for governments seeking to promote the growth of smaller cities, including place-based policy frameworks that concentrate investment and quality of life gains in a defined set of centres, further development of these localities as retirement destinations and their growth as education and research hubs. Key findings In broad terms the research found smaller cities experienced a range of processes shaping their populations over the period 2011â€“2016. ] Absolute population growth was highest amongst smaller cities located in coastal regions next to the two major cities in south-east Australia, indicating population concentration in regional Australian settlements. By contrast, population decline was concentrated in inland and remote towns, particularly in centres associated with resource industries. The processes of population concentration in fewer and larger regional settlements evident in the 20th century appears continued (BITRE 2014). International migration was largely similar, with most relocating to larger regional urban centres. Smaller cities are the first destination of few international arrivals. Many internal migrants relocating to smaller cities come from other parts of non-metropolitan Australia. â€˜Sunbeltâ€™ cities have fared better than regional centres in southern Australia over recent decades, but this growth may be a product of population, rather than economic, processes. There is a long standing pattern of accelerated growth amongst coastal cities on the eastern seaboard. Growth is also more pronounced in smaller cities closer to a major metropolitan region. In some regions, larger regional centres are growing as nearby smaller settlements decline. COVID-19 had a muted impact on the movement of population to smaller cities, with the greatest impact in Victoria. Importantly, fundamental change is possible but a definitive conclusion on likelihood cannot be reached at this stage. The research categorised population change into three main groupings: Larger regional cities that are close to a major (state capital) cities grew more (by count) than other regional areas. Coastal urban centres gained more population than inland urban centres. Regional urban centres in northern coastal NSW and Queensland in particular continued to grow rapidly. Population losses tended to be concentrated in inland, smaller, remote and often resource reliant towns. These patterns may be associated with continuing weakness and employment declines in traditional regional industry sectors such as agriculture, or with transitions within resource extractive industries, following the mining infrastructure investment boom of the late-2000s and early-2010s. The patterns of Indigenous population change reflected overall population patterns but diverged also. Indigenous population growth was greatest in some coastal localities, though these were not always the same places where the non-Indigenous population is increasing. Some inland localities without large overall growth saw substantial growth in Indigenous residents. Economically smaller cities are a highly differentiated group, with the processes of growth and decline influenced by individual histories and geographies. Broad patterns can be identified amongst groups of smaller cities. The national economy and policy has had a significant impact on the growth of smaller cities. The liberalisation of the Australian economy post 1984 and the rise of service industries has not benefited smaller cities specialised in manufacturing and agriculture, but has assisted some mining centres. National economic policy change has further reinforced the expansion of the major metropolitan centres. Australiaâ€™s smaller cities commonly have highly specialised and trade-exposed economies, resulting in periods of â€˜boomâ€™ and â€˜bustâ€™ as industries cycle through swings in global markets. There is clear evidence that endogenous growth processes are very weak in many parts of regional Australia, including amongst the economies of smaller cities. Much of the aggregate economic growth across regional Australia trails population growth, that is growing populations lead an expansion of employment. The research found that programs to encourage relocation to smaller cities are likely to gain traction with Australian residents if the appropriate population groups are targetted. State preference analysis found four distinct segments, or classes, across the Australian population, differentiated by their willingness to live in large and mid-sized cities. Critically the four classes provide a guide to the targeting of policy measures: Classes 1 (the Urban Careerists) and 4 (the Small is Best), together comprising 25 per cent of the sample population, displayed distinct preferences for large and mid-sized cities, respectively, and were unlikely to change their preferences. Individuals in Class 1 were young urban professionals who valued living in large cities. Individuals belonging to Class 4 tended to be older individuals employed part-time or retired, valued quality-of-life benefits from living in smaller cities, and were equally reluctant to move to a large city. Classes 2 (Aspirational Changers) and 3 (Lifestyle Maximisers) comprised the remaining 75 per cent and were more open to moving to a mid-sized city. Individuals belonging to Class 2 were more likely to be a mix of young individuals living in single or shared households, and the middle-aged in households with children. They tended to be university educated and employed full-time in high-wage managerial or professional jobs. They prioritised employment and education opportunities and were likely to move to mid-sized cities if they could offer comparable opportunities. Individuals in Class 3 were older, and employed part-time in lower paying jobs or retired. They placed high importance on quality of life, local healthcare, housing and other living costs. They viewed mid-sized cities as excellent places to retire, and would be encouraged to move there if they could get support for post retirement living. A sense of community remains an important feature of life in smaller cities, helping retain population and building a sense of cohesion. This sense of community contributes to the pattern of movement between smaller cities and other regional centres as individuals seek comparable living environments. The natural and other amenity of smaller cities is much valued by residents and it too remains a factor in the retention of residents in smaller cities, as well as the attraction of migrants from the capitals. High quality, affordable housing remains an important attractant for smaller cities but it needs to be balanced out with significant employment opportunities in order to encourage the growth of these places. Residents in smaller cities were wary of growth for its own sake. While many see advantages, there are concerns these may be exceeded by the disadvantages. Planning policies have had unequal outcomes across the Australian states. In NSW programs were developed that led to success, while the SA experience highlighted the limitations of approaching regional planning as an administrative exercise, distant from other programs of investment and development; and, Evidence-informed approaches that concentrate resources in places with both a record of growth and the potential for further expansion will be more successful. Policy development options This research examined the ways in which the policy landscape in Australia could be adjusted to promote the growth of smaller cities in order to deliver better outcomes for all Australians. Critically, one dimensional or simple policy measures are unlikely to deliver growth to smaller cities, instead a more holistic approach is required that draws together a number of actions. All, however, are eminently achievable, with either a track record of success in Australia or internationally. The research drew on the findings to consider five policy options: Option 1: Maintain existing policy settings and do not introduce new programs or initiatives Option 2: Further develop and activate land use planning to support the development of smaller cities Option 3: Develop a portfolio of place-based policies that seek to concentrate investment in a limited number of smaller cities Option 4: Implement policies that encourage the growth of further education in smaller cities Option 5: Expedite the growth of smaller cities as preferred places of residence for older Australians, including retirees. The research concluded that Option 1 was unlikely to deliver additional growth for Australiaâ€™s smaller cities because while current policy settings resulted in long term national economic growth, smaller cities largely lagged the very largest cities. Moreover, the population outcomes evident under contemporary policy settings are a product of deeply entrenched patterns and processes, and change in the external environment is essential if the nation is to achieve better outcomes. Option 2 was assessed to have real potential for delivering growth for smaller cities. However, this policy domain remains firmly the remit of the Australian states, which makes the achievement of positive outcomes in all parts of the nation more challenging as each jurisdiction has their own frameworks and settings. In addition, statutory planning systems are based in legislation and are therefore not adjusted easily or quickly. Option 2 also calls for a strong level of co-ordination and integration across the portfolios of governments, with planning, service delivery and infrastructure investment brought together to deliver growth locally. While this has been achieved in NSW, other states have either not prioritised the growth of smaller cities or have failed to develop integrating mechanisms. The further development of the planning system to deliver the growth of smaller cities can be assessed as having considerable potential, but would struggle to deliver uniform outcomes at the national scale. Option 3 draws on both national and international experience and seeks to both empower local decision makers to encourage growth, and provide a select number of smaller cities with a pathway to expedited growth. To a degree, Option 3 builds on established policy frameworks such as the City and Regional Deals, but more fundamentally it represents an approach that tailors growth investment to the opportunities evident in each locality. It is an approach that calls for both investment by the senior tiers of government and buy-in locally, and is likely to require a long-term investment of policy attention and capital. The available international evidence suggests strong prospects for success, with the OECD as strong advocates of place-based polices. Option 4 specifically addresses two of the evident weaknesses in the economic and demographic structures of smaller cities. First, most regional centres experience the loss of young people to the metropolitan regions as they seek employment and education opportunities. Second, many of these places have lower incomes and few well paid jobs, and the evidence within this research suggests much of their employment growth has been in low-paying employment. Option 4 seeks to redirect policy attention and resourcing in higher education and research to smaller cities in order to attract and retain young people in these places, and more closely integrate smaller cities into the global knowledge economy. This option would not require additional funding, but would require a redirection of resources. Option 5 seeks to further enhance the attractiveness of smaller cities as places for retirement for older Australians. It acknowledges that these places are already attractive to a significant percentage of older Australians and that this could be further enhanced through additional investment in health care and other services targetted at this age group. Such investment would also generate employment for other age cohorts. This option has a strength in harnessing the growth potential embedded in already established patterns within the economy and the population, and would potentially come at modest cost to Australian governments. It may, however, further entrench the lower income structures evident in a number of smaller cities. Finally, it is important to acknowledge the policy options discussed in this report are not mutually exclusive. Governments could potentially implement a portfolio of actions to maximise the prospects of smaller cities and associated regions. A portfolio approach would create opportunities for participation by all tiers of government and allow for a focus on the development of these places, rather than a simple focus on growth. The study The overarching aims of the Inquiry were addressed through three associated projects. Each of the projects focussed on Australiaâ€™s non-capital cities including the larger satellites, such as Newcastle, Wollongong, Geelong and the Gold Coast. The Inquiry examined all Australian jurisdictions, effectively establishing a nation-wide evidence base. The analysis focussed on urban centres with a population of 50,000 or more and in states with fewer than three urban centres reaching this threshold, it considered the three largest non-metropolitan centres in that jurisdiction. In addition, for technical reasons, Project B examined all urban centres with a population of 5,000 or more."
"Transcriptome profiling of lentil (Lens culinaris) through the first 24 hours of Ascochyta lentis infection reveals key defence response genes Genetic Variability; Ascochyta Lentis; Breeding Programs Background: Ascochyta blight, caused by the fungus Ascochyta lentis, is one of the most destructive lentil diseases worldwide, resulting in over $16 million AUD annual loss in Australia alone. The use of resistant cultivars is currently considered the most effective and environmentally sustainable strategy to control this disease. However, little is known about the genes and molecular mechanisms underlying lentil resistance against A. lentis. Results: To uncover the genetic basis of lentil resistance to A. lentis, differentially expressed genes were profiled in lentil plants during the early stages of A. lentis infection. The resistant 'ILL7537' and susceptible 'ILL6002' lentil genotypes were examined at 2, 6, and 24 h post inoculation utilising high throughput RNA-Sequencing. Genotype and time-dependent differential expression analysis identified genes which play key roles in several functions of the defence response: fungal elicitors recognition and early signalling; structural response; biochemical response; transcription regulators; hypersensitive reaction and cell death; and systemic acquired resistance. Overall, the resistant genotype displayed an earlier and faster detection and signalling response to the A. lentis infection and demonstrated higher expression levels of structural defence-related genes. Conclusions: This study presents a first-time defence-related transcriptome of lentil to A. lentis, including a comprehensive characterisation of the molecular mechanism through which defence against A. lentis is induced in the resistant lentil genotype."
"Whose quality? The (mis)uses of quality reform in early childhood and education policy Early Childhood Education and Care; Nursery Schools; Preschool Education This paper reports on the findings of an in-depth genealogical study of the discourse of quality in Australian Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) policy. Quality reform has become the foremost global policy agenda for ECEC due to assumptions about the economic potentials of quality services. In Australia, the recent National Quality Framework elevated early childhood policy in Australia from the margins as the lynchpin of a broader economic reform agenda. However, quality ECECâ€“what it is and doesâ€“is a complex, contestable notion that could be considered problematic for the sector to execute, particularly through market models of provision. Drawing on Foucauldian notions of discourse as the â€˜already saidâ€™, the truth assumptions that have underpinned policy uses of quality ECEC in Australia are identified and critiqued. It is shown that the discourse of quality has been tactically deployed in Australian ECEC policy to realign quality ECEC outcomes with educative outcomes, as a means for government to selectively grow and govern human capital. This positions quality as a high-stakes reform discourse for early childhood stakeholders, entwined with the expanded reach and intensification of selective, performance-related standards and incentives."
"A review of the current in-situ fouling control strategies in MBR: Biological versus physicochemical Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling Fouling in membrane bioreactors (MBR) is a bottleneck problem limiting their application. In-situ fouling control strategies have been continuously developed for decades, and can be mainly categorized as biological and physicochemical approaches. However, the mechanisms and performance of these methods as well as their application prospects have not been thoroughly discussed and compared in a systematic manner. This study was aimed at providing a detailed review on the various in-situ biological and physicochemical methods in terms of fouling control performance, fouling reduction mechanisms and practicability. This involves a comparison of the popular biological control strategies including quorum quenching (QQ)) and physicochemical approaches such as NaClO backflushing, hybrid electrochemical MBR and anti-biofouling membrane development, with the analysis of their potential, existing issues and practicality in full-scale applications. Future work is also recommended for developing more sustainable and more widely applicable MBR fouling control strategies."
"Increasing Use of Human-Dominated Habitats as CO2 Emissions Warm and Acidify Oceans Biodiversity; Patellogastropoda; Intertidal Community Urban and artificial structures are increasingly added to the worldâ€™s coasts during a time in which changing climate is forecast to drive shifts in naturally occurring habitats. We ask whether the role of artificial structures as marine habitats will increase in importance relative to their natural counterparts, particularly as natural habitats are negatively affected by ocean warming and acidification. To evaluate this model, we contrasted use of natural (kelp forest and turfing algae) and artificial habitat (plastic pier-piling) by a nest-building amphipod (Cymadusa pemptos) under current and future climate conditions of CO2 and temperature. Under future conditions, amphipod populations in mesocosms increased, but this did not lead to greater proportional colonization of kelp and turf. Instead, colonization doubled in artificial habitats, and there was increasing production and occupation of nests on artificial habitats relative to natural habitats. In an age when human modification of natural substrata is increasingly cited as an agent of wildlife decline, understanding the future role of artificial habitats as replacement dwellings for natural habitats is critical. We pioneer an understanding of the future role of natural and artificial habitats, identifying the possibility that the role of urban structures as marine habitats may only increase."
"Convergence and determinants of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia: A regional analysis Integrated Assessment Model; Carbon; Global Temperature Increase Australia's emissions from fossil fuels and industry have been on the rise since 2014 and may fall short of its required 2030 Paris Agreement target of 26â€“28% (below 2005 levels). While much effort has been made by various states and territories in setting emission targets and the uptake in renewable energy sources, significant inroads need to occur in order to meet the 1.5 Â°C target. Understanding the dynamics of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the regional level is thus essential for policymakers in achieving emission targets given the decomposition of industry at the regional level. We investigate the convergence process of three significant GHG emissions â€“ carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane emissions â€“ at regional level over the period 1990 to 2017. Our results identify multiple convergence clusters in GHG emissions, highlighting the need for tailored policies at the regional level. To gain an understanding in the factors driving these results, we analysed the determinants of the convergence process. We identified that state income per capita, urbanisation, and international trade plays a crucial in the convergence path off GHG emissions."
"Digital transformation: Environmental friend or foe? panel discussion at the australasian conference on information systems 2019 Green Computing; IT Adoption; Sustainable Development The advent of digital technologies such as social media, mobile, analytics, cloud computing, and the Internet of things has provided unique opportunities for organizations to engage in affordable, easy-to-use, easy-to-learn, and easy-to-implement innovations. Transformations through such technologies often have positive impacts on business processes, products, and services. As such, organizations have managed to increase productivity and efficiency, reduce cycle time, and make substantial gains through digital transformation. Research has also found such transformations to be positively associated with reducing harmful environmental impacts by providing organizations alternative ways to conduct their business activities. However, in recent times when organizations can use many technologies at near-zero cost, questions regarding the potential negative impacts that digital transformation has on the environment have arisen. The contemporary ubiquitous technologies that pervade everyday life necessitate that organizations continue to create large data centers that increase in capacity daily; however, such growth also increases their impact on the environment. Considering this dialectical contradiction, in 2019, we conducted a panel at the Australasian Conference on Information Systems (ACIS) in Perth, Australia, to invigorate the dialogue regarding the impact that digital transformation has on environmental sustainability and investigate some directions for future research in this area."
"Monitoring aboveground forest biomass dynamics over three decades using Landsat time-series and single-date inventory data Landsat; Land Cover; Remote Sensing Understanding forest biomass dynamics is crucial for carbon and environmental monitoring, especially in the context of climate change. In this study, we propose a robust approach for monitoring aboveground forest biomass (AGB) dynamics by combining Landsat time-series with single-date inventory data. We developed a Random Forest (RF) based kNN model to produce annual maps of AGB from 1988 to 2017 over 7.2 million ha of forests in Victoria, Australia. The model was internally evaluated using a bootstrapping technique. Predictions of AGB and its change were then independently evaluated using multi-temporal Lidar data (2008 and 2016). To understand how natural and anthropogenic processes impact forest AGB, we analysed trends in relation to the history of disturbance and recovery. Specifically, change metrics (e.g., AGB loss and gain, Years to Recovery - Y2R) were calculated at the pixel level to characterise the patterns of AGB change resulting from forest dynamics. The imputation model achieved a RMSE value of 132.9 Mg haâˆ’1 (RMSE% = 46.3%) and R2 value of 0.56. Independent assessments of prediction maps in 2008 and 2016 using Lidar-based AGB data achieved relatively high accuracies, with a RMSE of 108.6 Mg haâˆ’1 and 135.9 Mg haâˆ’1 for 2008 and 2016, respectively. Annual validations of AGB maps using un-changed, homogenous Lidar plots suggest that our model is transferable through time (RMSE ranging from 109.65 Mg haâˆ’1 to 112.27 Mg haâˆ’1 and RMSE% ranging from 25.38% to 25.99%). In addition, changes in AGB values associated with forest disturbance and recovery (decrease and increase, respectively) were captured by predicted maps. AGB change metrics indicate that AGB loss and Y2R varied across bioregions and were highly dependent on levels of disturbance severity (i.e., a greater loss and longer recovery time were associated with a higher severity disturbance). On average, high severity fire burnt from 200 Mg haâˆ’1 to 550 Mg haâˆ’1 of AGB and required up to 15 years to recover while clear-fell logging caused a reduction in 250 Mg haâˆ’1 to 600 Mg haâˆ’1 of AGB and required nearly 20 years to recover. In addition, AGB within un-disturbed forests showed statistically significant but monotonic trends, suggesting a mild gradual drop over time across most bioregions. Our methods are designed to support forest managers and researchers in developing forest monitoring systems, especially in developing regions, where only a single date forestry inventory exists."
"Occupational meaning, well-being and coping: A study of culturally and linguistically diverse hotel workers during COVID-19 Emigration And Immigration; Resettlement; Asylum Given COVID-19's disproportionate adverse impact on hospitality employees, we explore the proposition that COVID-19-related career challenges prompt CALD hospitality workers to rethink the meaning and purpose of work to explore ways to cope and restore occupational well-being, thus triggering occupational change. Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews with 25 CALD hotel workers reveal different sub-groups of CALD hotel workers differentially cognitively frame pandemic-induced employment changes to cope and restore occupational well-being: 1. as an opportunity for behavioral (occupational) change by CALD workers in refugee jobs; 2. as a temporary phenomenon, with CALD workers who were temporary migrants foreseeing positive career outcomes; and 3. as an opportunity for behavioral (occupational) advancement in hotels by CALD workers who were permanent residents with hospitality qualifications. We contribute to literature at the intersection of coping and occupational well-being research in hospitality, providing a fine-grained understanding of how CALD hotel workers coped and restored occupational well-being, by differentially reconstruing the meaning of work and undertaking occupational change, be it cognitive or behavioral."
"Minimizing the gap between expectation and ability: Strategies for smes to implement social sustainability practices Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices Traditionally, it is believed that small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not have enough ability to adopt and persistently practice social sustainability. This is because SMEs are not capital-intensive companies and neither are their returns nor skills. At the same time, the wellbeing of the employees in SMEs cannot be ensured and sustainable development goals cannot be achieved without making SMEs socially sustainable, as they account for the majority of world businesses. Moreover, the expectation of the stakeholders and subsequent pressure on SMEs to practicing social sustainability remains. Such pressure from the stakeholders creates a ""mismatch problem"" between stakeholders' expectations and SMEs' abilities to adopt socially sustainable practices. This study aims to explore what factors are responsible for this ""mismatch problem"", and how SMEs can handle this mismatch to be socially sustainable firms. Based on a rigorous literature review, this study reveals that both internal issues, such as a lack of resources and awareness, and external issues, such as the non-existence of a tailored social sustainability standard for SMEs and lack of institutional support, are responsible for this gap. This study develops several propositions that highlight the requirements in various situations and provides strategies outlining the implications for SMEs and their stakeholders to make SMEs socially sustainable. Overall, this study discloses that cooperative support from stakeholders, especially during a disruption such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a finance mechanism, the development of awareness and human capital in SMEs, and a unified standard for SMEs are likely to improve social sustainability practices in SMEs."
"A roadmap for systematically identifying opportunities in ecosystems using scientific publications data Technology Roadmapping; Data Mining; Technological Competitiveness Opportunity identification is a continuous process in ecosystems. However, ambiguities and challenges associated with knowledge exploration and exploitation can retard opportunity recognition processes. This in turn may culminate in excessive expenditure of resources or loss of latent opportunities. The present study adopts an analytical approach and proposes a methodological roadmap that utilizes scientometric and text mining techniques. The roadmap uses data from Web of Science as input, and generates insights that support decision-making about resource saving, strategic planning, investment, and policymaking. Our roadmap extends methods used in studying ecosystems by combining existing and novel techniques in data analytics. Using Python and VOSViewer, we show an exemplary application of the new roadmap, framed in the context of the Nordic countries' renewable energy ecosystem."
"Site planning and design of green residential building projects: case studies in China Green Building; Construction Industry; Project Delivery Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present site planning and design (SPD) relevant variables and items in practice for practitioners to better understand and implement SPD in green building projects. Design/methodology/approach: The research methods include questionnaire survey and case studies in the context of China. A questionnaire survey was adopted to identify the importance of 13 variables and the corresponding 38 items in SPD of green residential buildings. Three green residential projects including one in Hong Kong and two in Mainland China were selected to investigate the SPD considerations in practice and to discuss the necessary improvement. Findings: The results show that 12 out of the 13 variables of SPD in green buildings are involved in the three case projects to some extent, thereby underscore the importance of these variables. The potential improvement in real-life SPD of green buildings is also discussed such as adopting design-build and integrated project delivery methods and preserving and protecting cultural characteristics on site. Originality/value: The research findings may serve as a reference for practitioners to better conduct SPD in green building projects."
"Blockchain and the evolution of institutional technologies: Implications for innovation policy Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things For the past century economists have proposed a suite of theories relating to industrial dynamics, technological change and innovation. There has been an implication in these models that the institutional environment is stable. However, a new class of institutional technologiesâ€”most notably blockchain technologyâ€”lower the cost of institutional entrepreneurship along these margins, propelling a process of institutional evolution. This presents a new type of innovation process, applicable to the formation and development of institutions for economic governance and coordination. This paper develops a replicator dynamic model of institutional innovation and proposes some implications of this innovation for innovation policy. Given the influence of public policies on transaction costs and associated institutional choices, it is indicated that policy settings conductive to the adoption and use of blockchain technology would elicit entrepreneurial experiments in institutional forms harnessing new coordinative possibilities in economic exchange. Conceptualisation of blockchain-related public policy an innovation policy in its own right has significant implications for the operation and understanding of open innovation systems in a globalised context."
"Seasonal metabolic analysis of marine sediments collected from Moreton Bay in South East Queensland, Australia, using a multi-omics-based approach Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus Anthropogenic effects of urban density have altered natural ecosystems. Such changes include eutrophication of freshwater and adjoining coastal habitats, and increased levels of inorganic nutrients and pollutants into waterways. In Australia, these changes are intensified by large-scale ocean-atmospheric events, leading to considerable abiotic stress on the natural flora and fauna. Bacterial communities in marine sediments from Moreton Bay (South East Queensland, Australia) were examined in order to assess the impact of rainfall changes, chemical pollution, and subsequent abiotic stress on living organisms within a marine ecosystem. Sediments were collected during the wet and dry seasons and analyzed using bacterial metagenomics and community metabolomics techniques. Physicochemical data were also analyzed to account for biological variance that may be due to non-rainfall-based abiotic stresses. Wet-dry seasonality was the dominant control on bacterial community structure and metabolic function. Changes in the availability of nutrients, organic matter and light appeared to be the major seasonal stressors. In contrast, urban and industrial pollutants appeared to be minor stressors at the sites sampled. During the wet season, the bacterial community composition reflected organisms that utilize biogeochemical pathways with fast kinetics, such as aerobic metabolism, direct assimilation of inorganic compounds, and primary production. The transition to the dry season saw the bacterial community composition shift towards organisms that utilize more complex organic energy sources, such as carbohydrates and fatty acids, and anaerobic redox processes."
"Sociodemographic characteristics and social exclusion among the oldest old Loneliness; Social Isolation; COVID-19 Objectives: The socioeconomically disadvantaged oldest old (people aged 85 years and over) are more vulnerable to social exclusion than the general population. Using a population representative sample, this paper examined associations between sociodemographic characteristics and social exclusion among the oldest old. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 307 participants aged 85 years and over from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. Sociodemographic characteristics were measured using household composition, country of birth, housing tenure, income, education and neighbourhood-level disadvantage. Three social exclusion domains were derived representing unsupportive relationships, neighbourhood exclusion and community disengagement. Analysis was undertaken separately for men and women. Results: Among men, living alone was associated with higher levels of unsupportive relationships (Î² = 11.6, 95%CI 2.1, 21.0) and having a lower income was associated with lower levels of neighbourhood disunity (Î² = âˆ’16.7, 95%CI âˆ’31.2, âˆ’2.2). Among women, living alone was associated with lower levels of community disengagement (Î² = âˆ’7.2, 95%CI âˆ’13.4, âˆ’0.9) and neighbourhood disadvantage was associated with lower levels of neighbourhood disunity (Î² = âˆ’10.4, 95%CI âˆ’19.6, âˆ’1.2). Both men and women with lower levels of education had higher levels of community disengagement (men: Î² = 8.3, 95%CI 1.9, 14.7; women: Î² = 17.0, 95%CI 8.6, 25.5). Conclusions: This study showed few and unexpected associations between sociodemographic characteristics and social exclusion among oldest-old Australians, suggesting a homogeneous effect of advancing age. Government approaches aimed at reducing social exclusion in this age group should consider gender and taking action across all socioeconomic stratification. Further research is warranted to understand the underlying mechanisms linking sociodemographic characteristics to social exclusion."

"The influence of organic urban morphologies on opportunities for home-based businesses within inner-city districts in Hanoi, Vietnam Urban Planning; Iotrolan; Urban Design To a typical family in Hanoi, their house is not solely their home, but a valuable basis for their livelihood: a home-based business. This paper investigates the spatial impact of the cityâ€™s dominant built form characterized by organic urban morphology and building typology on home-based economic activities. Space Syntax is adopted to examine the proximity from these homes to the local main streets, which provides a pool of customers. Findings show that home-based economic opportunities are spatially distributed and sorted. The paper provides an evidence-based understanding of the economic performance of informal urbanism, and the potential impacts of urban design and planning decisions on individualsâ€™ and citiesâ€™ economic well-being."
"Multiplexed detection of cancer biomarkers using a microfluidic platform integrating single bead trapping and acoustic mixing techniques Giant Magnetoresistance; Ferrofluids; Magnetic Field It is critical to reliably and rapidly detect multiple disease biomarkers in tiny liquid samples with high sensitivity to meet the growing demand for point-of-care diagnostics. This paper reports a microfluidic platform integrating magnetic-based single bead trapping in conjunction with acoustic micromixing for simultaneous detection of multiple cancer biomarkers within minutes. Individual beads retained by permalloy (NiFe81/19) microarray were used to capture biomarkers and facilitate the fluorescence identification. A numerical study indicates that the magnetic force keeping a bead in the trap is proportional to the thickness of the permalloy array and the external magnetic field strength, while inversely proportional to the size of the trap. The acoustic microstreaming activated by a piezo transducer was applied to generate fast-switching flow patterns to minimize the diffusion length scales. The flow at various driving frequencies was experimentally tested to achieve the optimal mixing effect. The flow field of the microstreaming was subsequently described by a mathematical model to understand the flow further. Finally, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were employed as model analytes to demonstrate the capability of the platform for rapid biomarker detection. With the aid of acoustic micromixing, the detection can be finished in 20 minutes. The respective limit of detection of PSA and CEA is 0.028 ng mL-1 (0.8 pM) and 3.1 ng mL-1 (17 pM), which is respectively 1/142 and 1/3 of the cutoff value of PSA and CEA. Our results indicate this platform has great potential for the rapid detection of multiple biomarkers in future point-of-care diagnostics."
"Phase volume quantification of agarose-ghee gels using 3D confocal laser scanning microscopy and blending law analysis: A comparison Emulsions; Microgels; Gel A thorough understanding of the phase behaviour of biomaterial composites is imperative for manipulating the structural and textural properties in novel food products. This study probed the phase behaviour of a model system comprising agarose and a varying concentration of ghee. Results obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and dynamic oscillation in-shear revealed discontinuous and hard inclusions of ghee reinforcing the continuous, weaker agarose matrix with increasing concentrations of the former. Phase behaviour of the system was quantified in parallel with a novel method combining 3D confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) imaging and image analysis software - FIJI and Imaris - in an effort to substantiate the efficacy of the microscopic protocol in quantifying phase behaviour. Phase volumes recorded with the microscopic protocol were in close agreement to those modelled with the Lewis-Nielsen blending law using small-deformation dynamic oscillation. However, results indicated that the inner filtering effect or â€˜self-shadowingâ€™ observed commonly in CLSM images may pose a limitation to the application of this technique, necessitating further development before it can be applied to more complex, industrially relevant systems."
"Chinese Medicine Syndromes and Stages of Early Breast Cancer: Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Implication for Clinical Practice Integrative Oncology; Breast Neoplasms; Homeopathy Background: Chinese medicine (CM) has been widely used for women's health, including those with early breast cancer. Contemporary literature varies in descriptions of the CM syndromes that are critical for determining CM treatment options for breast cancer patients. However, the corresponding syndromes have not been standardized to align with the conventional medicine treatment stages. This review aimed to address this knowledge gap to enhance the quality and consistency of CM interventions for early breast cancer patients. Methods: In total, eight Chinese and English language databases were searched, and textbooks and clinical care documents were gathered. Sources were classified according to five treatment stages: preoperative, postoperative, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and endocrine therapy. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the syndromes, and hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted to investigate clusters of signs and symptoms. Results: The CM syndrome of dual deficiency of qi and Blood was one of the most common syndromes across all treatment stages, whereas lack of strength and lassitude were the most common clinical presentations throughout all stages, except the preoperative stage. Cluster analyses identify three or four syndromes in each treatment stage. Cluster results for the preoperative stage were: Blood stasis, Liver depression and qi stagnation, and Kidney yin deficiency. Dual deficiency of qi and Blood existed at different stages except for the preoperative stage. In the postoperative stage and chemotherapy stages, some symptoms were categorized into clusters that related to the Spleen and Stomach. Syndromes such as yin deficiency with fire toxin and yin deficiency with fluid depletion were unique to the radiation therapy stage. Clusters for endocrine therapy stage included the dual deficiency of Spleen and Kidney, Liver depression and qi stagnation, and Kidney yin deficiency. Conclusions: Systematic review of the contemporary literature for early breast cancer revealed that the most frequently seen CM syndromes and cluster results have some similarities but some important distinctions. Clinical data are needed to confirm whether the syndromes described in contemporary literature reflect those seen in women with early breast cancer."
"Delicately designed Sn-based electrode material via spray pyrolysis for high performance lithium-ion battery Carbon; Tin Dioxide; Ion Storage A new and feasible strategy for preparing Sn@ZnO@N-C composites as high-performance anode materials with respect to lithium ion battery (LIB) was developed through dry spray and followed by high-temperature pyrolysis. Porous MOF ZIF-8 was employed as template to provide spherical interconnected C-N framework as accommodation for active nanosize Sn and ZnO particles (designated as Sn@ZnO@N-C-y, y = 1, 2 and 3). Considering the low melting point of Sn (232 Â°C), pyrolysis is a sound technique to yield Sn@ZnO@N-C-y products with variable structural features through tailoring the quantity of stock SnCl2 salt in the preparation solutions. Electrochemical performance of the Sn@ZnO@N-C-y composites was examined in a form of anode in coin-type LIB devices. Results indicate that all the produced Sn@ZnO@N-C-y composites exhibit superior electrochemical performance. The quantity of the added raw SnCl2 imposes a profound impact on the formation of physical structures and consequent specific capacity and cycle life of the Sn@ZnO@N-C-y composite based anodes. Of the anode options, it is noted that Sn@ZnO@N-C-2 with a yolk-shell structure delivers the highest cycle stability, which retains a stable capacity of 1114.8 mA h gâˆ’1 after 500 cycles at a current density of 100 mA gâˆ’1. The void space in Sn@ZnO@N-C-2 is beneficial to buffer against volume variations. Meanwhile, the C-N framework enhances electronic conductivity to a great degree and N contributes dramatically to the excellent capacity retention and superior rate capability. Such a newly designed synthesis pathway provides new guidance to the design and manufacturing of nanostructured anode materials with high performance for next-generation LIB."
"Nano/microplastics: Fragmentation, interaction with co-existing pollutants and their removal from wastewater using membrane processes Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Nano: and microplastic (NP/MP) is one of the most challenging types of micropollutants, coming from either direct release or degradation of plastic items into ecosystems. NP/MP can adsorb hazardous pollutants (such as heavy metals and pharmaceutical compounds) and pathogens onto their surface that are consumed by humans, animals, and aquatic living organisms. This paper presents the interaction of NP/MP with other pollutants in the water environment and mechanisms involved to enable the ultimate fate of NP/MP as well as the effectiveness of metal-organic frame (MOF)-based membrane over conventional membrane processes for NP/MP removal. It is found that conventional membranes could remove MPs when their size is usually more than 1000 nm, but they are ineffective in removing NPs. These NPs have potentially greater health impacts due to their greater surface area. MOF-based membrane could effectively remove both NP and MP due to its large porous structure, high adsorption capacity, and low density. This paper also discusses some challenges associated with MOF-based membranes for NP/MP removal. Finally, we conclude a specific MOF-based ultrafiltration membrane (ED-MIL-101 (Cr)) that can potentially remove both negative and positive charged NP/MP from wastewater by electrostatic attraction and repulsion force with efficient water permeability."
"Emerging prospects of integrated bioanalytical systems in neuro-behavioral toxicology Caenorhabditis Elegans; Hermaphrodite; Animals Neurotoxicity effects of industrial contaminants are currently significantly under investigated and require innovative analytical approaches to assess health and environmental risks at individual, population and ecosystem levels. Behavioral changes assessed using small aquatic invertebrates as standard biological indicators of the aggregate toxic effects, have been broadly postulated as highly integrative indicators of neurotoxicity with physiological and ecological relevance. Despite recent increase in understanding of the emerging value of behavioral biotests, their wider implementation especially in high-throughput environmental risk assessment assays, is largely limited by the lack of advances in analytical technologies. To date, most of the behavioral biotests have only been performed with larger-volumes and lacked dynamic flow-through conditions. They also lack features necessary for development of higher throughput neuro-behavioral ecotoxicity assays such as miniaturization and integration of automated components. We postulate that some contemporary analytical limitations can be effectively addressed by innovative Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) technologies, an emerging and multidisciplinary field poised to bring significant miniaturization to aquatic ecotoxicity testing. Recent developments in this emerging field demonstrate particular opportunities to study a plethora of behavioral responses of small model organisms in a high-throughput fashion. In this review, we highlight recent advances in this budding new interdisciplinary field of research. We also outline the existing challenges, barriers to development and provide a future outlook in the evolving field of neurobehavioral ecotoxicology."
"A discursive–institutional perspective on transformative governance: A case from a fire management policy sector Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Scholarship around questions of climate change adaptation is increasingly concerned with ideas of transformative adaptation and its governance through critical re-evaluation of beliefs, values and associated institutions. For public policy sectors, the concept of transformative governance brings attention to their capacities for supporting and engaging in such governance. While much adaptation research and practice informs technical and structural understandings of these capacities (e.g., governance arrangements, learning systems and adaptation planning), most of this research (and practice) has ignored less formal, yet equally important dimensions of public administration and governance. Institutional scholarship highlights that dominant norms, beliefs, and philosophical ideas underpin how policy sectors structure their policy responses and engagement in governance. Discursive Institutionalism suggests that examining a sector's dominant discourse can provide insights into these â€œinstitutional logicsâ€. This paper therefore argues that understanding a policy sector's institutional logics is a crucial part of working toward enabling transformative governance of adaptation. This argument is developed through a case study of the institutional logics operating in the fire management policy sector of Victoria, Australia, and the potential influence of these logics on that sector's capacities to engage in transformative governance. Findings suggest this sector's institutional logics may currently constrain its capacities to engage in transformative governance and highlight the need for greater attention to socioinstitutional dimensions of public administration to help catalyze transformative governance of (and for) adaptation."
"In vitro and in silico approach of fungal growth inhibition by Trichoderma asperellum HbGT6-07 derived volatile organic compounds Trichoderma; Fungi; Harzianum A The species of Trichoderma are one of the most frequently used natural biocontrol agent. This study, we identified isolate HbGT6-07 of Trichoderma asperellum and evaluated the antimicrobial effects both in vitro and in silico approaches. Tested 10% concentrated culture filtrate of HbGT6-07 inhibited 98% of colony radial growth in B. cinerea (B05.10) as well as 91% of S. sclerotiorum (A367). HbGT6-07 was detected to produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with antifungal activity. In in-vitro dish-within-dish method (DwD), The HbGT6-07 VOCs effectively reduced colonial diameter, growth rate and sclerotia production by two virulent fungal pathogens. Moreover, the hyphal fragments of HbGT6-07 demonstrated successful mycelia growth suppression (97%) against infection oilseed rape leaves by hyphae of the two virulent fungal pathogens through competition. The mixed culture assay, exhibited that the isolate T. asperellum HbGT6-07 was significantly reduced the production and weight of sclerotia. The GC-MS analysis identified 32 VOCs derived from HbGT6-07. In addition, VOCs derived from HbGT6-07 were assessed against targeted protein of three fungal species; Aspergillus oryzae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans via molecular docking. Butylated hydroxytolune and Beta-Cedrene had energy (âˆ’5.3 and âˆ’5.7 Kcal/mol) for targeted protein of Aspergillus oryzae and (âˆ’6.8 and âˆ’8.0 Kcal/mol) for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas alpha-bergamotene and Beta-Cedrene exihbit energy (âˆ’7.5 and âˆ’7.4 Kcal/mol), respectively. The molecular dynamics study confirms the structural stability and rigidity of the docked complex through multiple descriptors from simulation trajectories. The above findings indicated that HbGT6-07 could attain competitive progress via production of VOCs and comprehensive mycelial growth."
"Heart healthy cities: Genetics loads the gun but the environment pulls the trigger Aircraft Noise; Transportation Noise; Health Effect of Noise The world's population is estimated to reach 10 billion by 2050 and 75% of this population will live in cities. Two-third of the European population already live in urban areas and this proportion continues to grow. Between 60% and 80% of the global energy use is consumed by urban areas, with 70% of the greenhouse gas emissions produced within urban areas. The World Health Organization states that city planning is now recognized as a critical part of a comprehensive solution to tackle adverse health outcomes. In the present review, we address non-communicable diseases with a focus on cardiovascular disease and the urbanization process in relation to environmental risk exposures including noise, air pollution, temperature, and outdoor light. The present review reports why heat islands develop in urban areas, and how greening of cities can improve public health, and address climate concerns, sustainability, and liveability. In addition, we discuss urban planning, transport interventions, and novel technologies to assess external environmental exposures, e.g. using digital technologies, to promote heart healthy cities in the future. Lastly, we highlight new paradigms of integrative thinking such as the exposome and planetary health, challenging the one-exposure-one-health-outcome association and expand our understanding of the totality of human environmental exposures."
"Screening natural product extracts for potential enzyme inhibitors: protocols, and the standardisation of the usage of blanks in α-amylase, α-glucosidase and lipase assays In Vitro Studies; Orlistat; Anti-Obesity Agents Background: Enzyme assays have widespread applications in drug discovery from plants to natural products. The appropriate use of blanks in enzyme assays is important for assay baseline-correction, and the correction of false signals associated with background matrix interferences. However, the blank-correction procedures reported in published literature are highly inconsistent. We investigated the influence of using different types of blanks on the final calculated activity/inhibition results for three enzymes of significance in diabetes and obesity; Î±-glucosidase, Î±-amylase, and lipase. This is the first study to examine how different blank-correcting methods affect enzyme assay results. Although assays targeting the above enzymes are common in the literature, there is a scarcity of detailed published protocols. Therefore, we have provided comprehensive, step-by-step protocols for Î±-glucosidase-, Î±-amylase- and lipase-inhibition assays that can be performed in 96-well format in a simple, fast, and resource-efficient manner with clear instructions for blank-correction and calculation of results. Results: In the three assays analysed here, using only a buffer blank underestimated the enzyme inhibitory potential of the test sample. In the absorbance-based Î±-glucosidase assay, enzyme inhibition was underestimated when a sample blank was omitted for the coloured plant extracts. Similarly, in the fluorescence-based Î±-amylase and lipase assays, enzyme inhibition was underestimated when a substrate blank was omitted. For all three assays, method six [Raw Data - (Substrate + Sample Blank)] enabled the correction of interferences due to the buffer, sample, and substrate without double-blanking, and eliminated the need to add substrate to each sample blank. Conclusion: The choice of blanks and blank-correction methods contribute to the variability of assay results and the likelihood of underestimating the enzyme inhibitory potential of a test sample. This highlights the importance of standardising the use of blanks and the reporting of blank-correction procedures in published studies in order to ensure the accuracy and reproducibility of results, and avoid overlooked opportunities in drug discovery research due to inadvertent underestimation of enzyme inhibitory potential of test samples resulting from unsuitable blank-correction. Based on our assessments, we recommend method six [RD âˆ’ (Su + SaB)] as a suitable method for blank-correction of raw data in enzyme assays."
"Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence and CSR: Radical Feminist Theory and a Human Rights Perspective Fair Trade; Global Value Chains; Global Production Networks This paper extends Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) scholarship to focus on issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence. Despite a significant body of work on gender and CSR from a variety of feminist perspectives, long-standing evidence of sexual harassment and sexual violence in business, particularly in global value chains, and the rise of the #MeToo movement, there has been little scholarship focused specifically on these issues in the context of CSR. Our conceptual paper addresses this gap in the literature through two key contributions. First, we extend the theoretical base of CSR scholarship by drawing upon and explicating radical feminist theory, a resource that has been underutilized in the field to date. This theoretical perspective is well placed to offer insights around the issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence, and to explain the centrality of these concerns to the gender equality agenda in business and in CSR. Second, building upon insights from radical feminism, and from research on CSR and human rights, we explicate a business and human rights approach to sexual harassment, sexual violence and CSR. We point to ways in which this approach might be more effective in addressing these issues than previously adopted strategies and suggest directions for future research arising from our analysis."
"New technology and work: Exploring the challenges China; Institutional Quality; Multicultural Diversity Investigations into new technologies, employment and working conditions are timeless and consequently have occupied research, public policy, and popular fiction for centuries. However, in addition to the uncertainty created by the introduction of new technologies, the current coronavirus pandemic, with its associated impact on health and the economy, has led to increased volatility across the globe. The global medical crisis arising from the worldwide spread of COVID-19 is predicted to lead to a global economic crisis and subsequent deep depression. The resultant economic, social and political repercussions are likely to be felt for years or even decades to come, equalling the great depression of the last century. Consequently, it is difficult to make long-term accurate predictions about the impact of new technologies on industry, society, and labour. In this context, the aim of this introductory article to the themed volume is to consider the potential challenges and opportunities associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and potential impacts on work and workplaces. This introductory article comprises an international collection of research that examines the impact of technological change on employment and working conditions with consideration given to the additional impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

"Effect of Star Rating Improvement of Residential Buildings on Life Cycle Environmental Impacts and Costs Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building A diagnostic framework is proposed to assess the influence of star rating improvement for residential buildings on life cycle environmental impacts and life cycle costs (LCEI and LCC) using life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing methods, respectively, on all life cycle phases (i.e., construction, operation, maintenance, and disposal). A reference house was modified on the basis of six alternative designs to deliver a particular star rating in order to demonstrate the analysis framework. Two LCIA methods (i.e., material flows/add masses and eco-indicator 99 Australian substances) were used to estimate ten LCEI indicators under two categories: seven from problem-oriented (i.e., raw material, air emission, water emission, eco-toxicity, acidification/eutrophication potential, ozone depletion, and climate change) and three from damage-oriented (i.e., resource depletion, ecosystem quality, and effect on human health) categories. The three damage-oriented indicators were combined to evaluate environmental and economic wellbeing on a single eco-point basis. All these combinations of impact indicators can offer three lines of analytical options along with star rating: problem-oriented, damage-oriented, and a variety of problem and damage-oriented LCEIs with LCCs. Hence, the optimum house selection is-based not only on cost or star rating, but also on LCEIs."
"Spatial patterns and driving factors of urban residential embedded carbon emissions: An empirical study in Kaifeng, China Divisia Index; Logarithmic Mean; Carbon Emissions Effective strategies, policies and measures for carbon emission reduction need to be developed and implemented according to good understanding of both local conditions and spatial differentiation mechanism of energy consumption associated with human activities at high resolution. In the study, we first collected statistical yearbooks, high resolution remotely sensed imageries, and 3895 usable questionnaires for the urban areas of Kaifeng; then measured the carbon emissions from household energy consumption, using the accounting method provided in the IPCC GHG Inventory Guidelines; and finally applied both exploratory and explanatory statistical methods to characterize the spatial pattern of carbon emissions at high resolution, identify key influencing factors, and gain better understanding of the spatial differentiation mechanism of urban residential carbon emissions. Our study reached the following conclusions: (1) Central heating facilities with controllable flow are important for carbon emissions reduction, but its spatial distribution shows unfairness; (2) Spatial clusters of high carbon emission areas were primarily located in the outer suburbs of the city, validated to some extent the hypothesis that urban sprawl has a driving effect on the increasing urban residential carbon emissions; (3) Factors like size of residential area, family structure, life style, personal preference and behavior rather than household income have significant impacts on household carbon emissions, implying that effective control of residential areas, promotion of family life and low-carbon lifestyle, and effective guidance of proper behaviors and preferences will play a crucial role in reducing urban residential carbon emissions; and (4) Most of the identified influencing factors exhibit clear and specific spatial patterns and gradients of impact, implying that measures for urban residential carbon emission reduction should be adapted to location conditions. The study has generated a set of concrete evidences and improved understandings of the spatially differentiated mechanisms upon which the formation and deployment of any effective strategies, policies and measures for reducing urban residential carbon emissions should be based."
"Australian graduates’ work readiness – deficiencies, causes and potential solutions Employability; Competency; Soft Skills Purpose: It is widely reported that there is a competence deficit between graduating from Australian higher education (HE) and becoming work ready and that the deficit is becoming more pronounced. The purpose of this paper is to examine the work readiness competencies of Australian HE and vocational education (VE) graduates. The reported competence deficits, the causes of these deficits and the potential strategies to overcome these deficits are discussed. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative, inductive research design was used to examine Australian graduatesâ€™ work readiness competence, potential deficits, their causes and possible solutions to gain some preliminary insights and help shape future research. A multiple case design was used comprising key stakeholdersâ€™ in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. In-depth semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were conducted to gain insights from the key stakeholders. Findings: The stakeholders reported that the Australian VE and HE sectors do not sufficiently prepare graduates in terms of their work readiness skills. Self-management skills, communication (written and expression), team-work skills, cognitive skills, system thinking and innovation and creativity were the main work readiness competency deficits reported by the stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: The research has its limitations in terms of the limited sample and time frame, and the absence of input from graduates. The results of the study indicate the deteriorating state of the Australian graduate labour market and emphasise that an integrated approach is urgently required from all stakeholders to facilitate the transition and reduce the time taken from graduation to employment. Originality/value: The focus of the study is located in the Australian labour market in terms of the competencies that reportedly are present upon graduation and the competencies that employers are looking for on recruitment. The requisite competency list and the deficits are examined through the lens of four stakeholder groups; government representatives, industry representatives and VE and HE representatives."
"The Need for the Graduate Attribute Assessment Tool (GAAT) Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Universities have developed sets of Graduate Attributes (GAs) to be achieved by their graduates across all programs. GAs are often associated with development of â€˜sustainabilityâ€™ capabilities. However, there is little indication that sustainability GAs are assessed to determine the extent of achievement, application, relevance to professional practice or to provide feed-back into curriculum design. This paper reports on the development of the Graduate Attributes Assessment Tool (GAAT) to determine achievement of the sustainability GA. The research developed, in 2016, a tool to assess the level of graduate attainment, application and use of a sustainability GA in a graduateâ€™s workplace. The GAAT is unique as it is founded in the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). The tool was trailed on a sample of RMIT graduates and assessed to determine if it was an appropriate tool. The complex nature of the sustainability GA meant that a modified version of the TPB was required. This resulted in the development of questions that required participants to reflect on their behaviour in their workplace in relation to a specific scenario. Additional questions were included to enable feed-back on curriculum to allow for modification to assist sustainability GA achievement. The GAAT pilot indicated that it provided valid outcomes of the achievement of the sustainability GA and insight for curriculum review. Development of the GAAT and its piloting have provided the basis for a practical, flexible tool for assessing sustainability GAs, and has potential for further development into a tool for assessing the wide range of university GAs."
"Comparative assessment of parallel-hybrid-electric propulsion systems for four different aircraft Helicopter; Air Mobility; Propellers As battery technologies advance, electric propulsion concepts are on the edge of disrupting aviation markets. However, until electric energy storage systems are ready to allow fully electric aircraft, the combination of combustion engine and electric motor as a hybrid-electric propulsion system seems to be a promising intermediate solution. Consequently, the design space for future aircraft is expanded considerably, as serial-hybrid-, parallel-hybrid-, fully-electric, and conventional propulsion systems must all be considered. While the best propulsion system depends on a multitude of requirements and considerations, trends can be observed for certain types of aircraft and certain types of missions. This paper provides insight into some factors that drive a new design towards either conventional or hybrid propulsion systems. General aviation aircraft, VTOL air taxis, transport aircraft, and UAVs are chosen as case studies. Typical missions for each class are considered, and the aircraft are analyzed regarding their take-off mass and primary energy consumption. For these case studies, a high-level approach is chosen, using an initial sizing methodology. Results indicate that hybrid-electric propulsion systems should be considered if the propulsion system is sized by short-duration power constraints (e.g. take-off, climb). However, if the propulsion system is sized by a continuous power requirement (e.g. cruise), hybrid-electric systems offer hardly any benefit."
"Nanostructured antibacterial surfaces – What can be achieved? Psaltoda Claripennis; Nanopillars; Bactericidal Activity Nanomaterials have emerged as the new weapon in the arsenal to fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR). While antibiotics have played a major role in combating infectious diseases, AMR presents a new challenge for sustainability in global health, food security and development. Inspired by nature, recent trending research has demonstrated that specific nanoscale surface patterns can rupture and kill bacteria on contact. Nano-engineered surfaces have demonstrated good capacity to prevent bacterial attachment and biofilm formation (the precursor to infection) and could be used as a strategic disinfectant for medically and industrially relevant materials. This opinion paper provides an overview of the role of nanotechnologies, specifically nanostructured surfaces, in aiding the development of infection-resistant surfaces."
"Recycling of waste materials for asphalt concrete and bitumen: A review Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens Waste management has become an issue of increasing concern worldwide. These products are filling landfills and reducing the amount of livable space. Leachate produced from landfills contaminates the surrounding environment. The conventional incineration process releases toxic airborne fumes into the atmosphere. Researchers are working continuously to explore sustainable ways to manage and recycle waste materials. Recycling and reuse are the most efficient methods in waste management. The pavement industry is one promising sector, as different sorts of waste are being recycled into asphalt concrete and bitumen. This paper provides an overview of some promising waste products like high-density polyethylene, marble quarry waste, building demolition waste, ground tire rubber, cooking oil, palm oil fuel ash, coconut, sisal, cellulose and polyester fiber, starch, plastic bottles, waste glass, waste brick, waste ceramic, waste fly ash, and cigarette butts, and their use in asphalt concrete and bitumen. Many experts have investigated these waste materials and tried to find ways to use this waste for asphalt concrete and bitumen. In this paper, the outcomes from some significant research have been analyzed, and the scope for further investigation is discussed."
"Factors influencing intention to adopt ICT among intensive shrimp farmers Shrimp Culture; Farmers; Aquaculture Intensive shrimp production has been considered one way to increase output quantity. However, many factors need to be considered to maintain product quality, sustained practice, and environmental compliance. The adoption of monitoring technologies in shrimp farming such as monitoring important water quality parameters including temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and salinity, offers several benefits, including increasing farming processes and cost efficiency and reducing harmful environmental impacts. A sampled survey dataset comprising 184 shrimp farmers from Ca Mau, Kien Giang, and Soc Trang provinces in Vietnam, one of the world largest shrimp producers, was used to examine factors that affect farmers' adoption of aquaculture information and communication technologies (ICT). The study empirically tested an adoption model using technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior under perceived production risks. Results suggest that farmers who both perceive the ICT as being useful in their shrimp farms and are influenced by other important peers are more likely to adopt aquaculture technologies. Farmers who feel confident to learn a new technology are likely to find the technology easier to use than someone who is not as confident. Due to the inherent risky nature of intensive shrimp production, even if Vietnamese shrimp farmers perceive a high level of technology-adoption risk, they still feel more confident towards learning to use a new ICT and its usefulness, and are therefore likely to increase their adoption. The study's results suggest ICT service providers should collaborate with local aquaculture departments to develop pilot farms to showcase new aquaculture technologies and demonstrate key features and their compatibility with existing farms' infrastructure, which will consequently entice farmers to quickly adopt shrimp monitoring technologies."
"The design and synthesis of fluorescent coumarin derivatives and their study for Cu2+ sensing with an application for aqueous soil extracts Fluorescence; Rhodamines; Cupric Ion A series of fluorescent coumarin derivatives 2a-e were systematically designed, synthesized and studied for their Cu2+ sensing performance in aqueous media. The sensitivities and selectivities of the on-to-off fluorescent Cu2+ sensing signal were in direct correlation with the relative arrangements of the heteroatoms within the coordinating moieties of these coumarins. Probes 2b and 2d exhibited Cu2+ concentration dependent and selective fluorescence quenching, with linear ranges of 0-80 Î¼M and 0-10 Î¼M, and limits of detection of 0.14 Î¼M and 0.38 Î¼M, respectively. Structural changes of 2b upon Cu2+ coordination were followed by fluorescence titration, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), mass spectrometry, and single crystal X-ray diffraction on the isolated Cu2+-coumarin complex. The results revealed a 1:1 stoichiometry between 2b and Cu2+, and that the essential structural features for Cu2+-selective coordination are the coumarin C=O and a three-bond distance between the amide NH and heterocyclic N. Probe 2b was also used to determine copper (II) levels in aqueous soil extracts, with recovery rates over 80% when compared to the standard soil analysis method: inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)."
"Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling in the Circular Economy: A Review Lithium-ion Batteries; Nickel Metal Hydride Batteries; Leaching Lithium-ion batteries have become a crucial part of the energy supply chain for transportation (in electric vehicles) and renewable energy storage systems. Recycling is considered one of the most effective ways for recovering the materials for spent LIB streams and circulating the material in the critical supply chain. However, few review articles have been published in the research domain of recycling and the circular economy, with most mainly focusing on either recycling methods or the challenges and opportunities in the circular economy for spent LIBs. This paper reviewed 93 articles (66 original research articles and 27 review articles) identified in the Web of Science core collection database. The study showed that publications in the area are increasing exponentially, with many focusing on recycling and recovery-related issues; policy and regulatory affairs received less attention than recycling. Most of the studies were experiments followed by evaluation and plan-ning (as per the categorization made). Pre-treatment processes were widely discussed, which is a critical part of hydrometallurgy and direct physical recycling (DPR). DPR is a promising recycling technique that requires further attention. Some of the issues that require further consideration in-clude a techno-economic assessment of the recycling process, safe reverse logistics, a global EV assessment revealing material recovery potential, and a lifecycle assessment of experiments processes (both in the hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes). Furthermore, the application of the circular business model and associated stakeholdersâ€™ engagement, clear and definitive policy guidelines, extended producer responsibility implications, and material tracking, and identification deserve further focus. This study presents several future research directions that would be useful for academics and policymakers taking necessary steps such as product design, integrated recycling techniques, intra-industry stakeholder cooperation, business model development, techno-economic analysis, and others towards achieving a circular economy in the LIB value chain."
"Testing spatial measures of public open space planning standards with walking and physical activity health outcomes: Findings from the Australian national liveability study Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Green public open spaces (POS) are an important component of healthy, liveable, and sustainable urban environments. Planning policies for POS provision however tend to be evidence-free. A review of Australian state-level POS planning policies and standards was conducted and policy-specific spatial measures generated in GIS. These were linked with health data from the RESIDE survey and relationships examined with weekly walking for recreation and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). To facilitate the development of a comparable national measure of POS provision, the measures were replicated using a national-level dataset on POS and compared using intra-class correlations. Sixteen POS policy standards relating to the location, amount, access, and size of POS were identified. Only one POS standard was associated with a health outcome: RESIDE participants living in suburbs where 95% of residents lived within 400 m of a park had a three-fold increased odds of doing weekly MVPA. The national dataset did not appear to align with the types of POS typically addressed by urban POS planning policies and showed a low level of reliability with the finer-grain state layer (ICCs 0.185â€“0.312). These findings support existing literature indicating that neighbourhoods with greater access to POS within 400 m are associated with higher odds of physical activity. The current study suggests that not all POS standards are equal, and more research is required to determine whether current planning standards being implemented are achieving their full potential. The development of national evidence-based, policy-relevant POS indicators has the potential to inform future POS planning policies and decisions."
"Advances in biosolids pyrolysis: Roles of pre-treatments, catalysts, and co-feeding on products distribution and high-value chemical production Sewage; Pyrolysis; Pulp and Paper Sludge Biosolids (stabilised sewage sludge) are solid residuals from the wastewater treatment process and are considered important bioresource. Therefore, the valorisation routes of biosolids, particularly those involving thermochemical treatment, demand further attention. Among these thermochemical conversion strategies, the pyrolysis technique converts biosolids into potentially valuable products (biochar, bio-oil, and pyrolysis gas). The traditional approach to biosolids pyrolysis involves the conversion of the numerous organic and inorganic constituents under the same conditions in a single reactor. This approach suffers from many technical and economical limitations around product selectivity, conversion kinetics, product yields, and product application potential. Prominent is the production of heavy metals (HMs) concentrated biochar and nitro-oxygenated and polyaromatic hydrocarbons contaminated bio-oil. The role of feedstock pre-treatments, catalysts and co-feeding in mitigating some of these challenges is getting immense research attention, for which a critical review is necessary. This work provides an overview of the development in biosolids pyrolysis, covering the various effects of pre-treatment, catalysts, and co-processing in influencing the thermal degradation behaviour, pyrolysis kinetics, product distribution, and product properties. A comprehensive review of the recent literature shows that chemical pre-treatment of biosolids can concurrently achieve demineralisation, HMs removal and hydrolysis, which add further value to the overall pyrolysis upcycling of the treated biosolids. Various catalysts additives such as metal oxides, metal salts, and zeolites can facilitate a range of desired reactions and inhibit pollutants release during biosolids pyrolysis. Co-feeding with a range of feedstocks introduces numerous synergetic benefits on product yield and qualities during the conversion process. Furthermore, these feed or process modifications to biosolids pyrolysis influence the distribution of value-added chemical components (such as hydrocarbons, ammonia, phenols, and levoglucosan) in the bio-oil, which were critically reviewed. The integrated approach to biosolids pyrolysis through sole or joint pre-treatment, catalysis and co-feeding could bring about a new route in biosolids valorisation. Finally, the work concludes with key challenges and provides perspectives for future research."
"Narratives of transphobic violence in the Mexican province of Colima: A psychosocial analysis Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Nonconforming; Gender Dysphoria Background: Mexico has the second-highest index of crimes motivated by transphobia in the world. Transphobic violence manifests in a pervasive and complex manner in a country where violence permeates all aspects of social life. Some progress has been made to improve transgender rights and fight discrimination, but this has had an unequal impact in different geopolitical and cultural contexts within the country, particularly outside of metropolitan centers. Aim: The study explores how transphobia is experienced in the conservative province of Colima and how transphobic practices play a part in shaping transgender subjective experience and identity construction. A psychosocial theoretical framework is adopted to attend to the relationship between cultural, institutional and interpersonal practices in this process. Methods: A qualitative approach is used to explore how different forms of transphobic violence are experienced by trans women in Colima. A purposive sample of 12 trans women, aged 22-38years took part in narrative interviews which were analyzed thematically. Findings: The analysis is organized into three themes: (a) narratives of gender identity construction (b) gender expression and experiences of transphobic violence in Colima (c) sites for social support and change. Discussion: We argue that the psychosocial processes related to transphobia are context-specific shaping transgender identities and limiting and regulating gender expression. Family, education, LGBT community and the police were identified as key sites for support against or source of transphobic violence. Conclusion: Despite the challenging socio-political context interventions are needed in policy and institutional practices to tackle stigma, transphobia and, trans-misogyny and improve the lives of transgender people living in regional areas in the global south."

"Hydrophobic-Force-Driven Removal of Organic Compounds from Water by Reduced Graphene Oxides Generated in Agarose Hydrogels Nanobubbles; Bubble; Henry Law Hydrophobic reduced graphene oxides (rGOs) were generated in agarose hydrogel beads (AgarBs) by NaBH4 reduction of graphene oxides (GOs) initially loaded in the AgarBs. The resulting rGO-loaded AgarBs were able to effectively adsorb organic compounds in water as a result of the attractive hydrophobic force between the rGOs in the AgarBs and the organic compounds dissolved in aqueous media. The adsorption capacity of the rGOs was fairly high even toward reasonably water-soluble organic compounds such as rhodamine B (321.7 mg gâˆ’1) and aspirin (196.4 mg gâˆ’1). Yet they exhibited salinity-enhanced adsorption capacity and preferential adsorption of organic compounds with lower solubility in water. Such peculiar adsorption behavior highlights the exciting possibility for adopting an adsorption strategy, driven by hydrophobic forces, in practical wastewater treatment processes."
"Talaromyces pinophilus strain M13: a portrayal of novel groundbreaking fungal strain for phytointensification Trichoderma Reesei; Enzymes; Penicillium Oxalicum The aim of current research was to explore different fungi as plant growth promoting fungi (PGPF). Strains of Trichoderma are well explored till now. But there are few other fungal strains that are better than Trichoderma strains. The study involves the isolation of different fungi from the rhizosphere of various agriculture farms. After isolation, 18S rRNA identification was carried out. Isolated fungi belonged to genus Penicillium, Talaromyces, Trichoderma, and Aspergillus. Isolate M13 belonging to genus Talaromyces was screened for its plant growth promoting (PGP) activity as it is a novel strain and still to be explored. Isolate M13 was identified as Talaromyces pinophilus (MG011365). Indole acetic acid (IAA) estimation was carried out using Salkowski reagent. Isolate was allowed to grow in cultivation media (Potato Dextrose Broth, PDB) in which one was supplemented with tryptophan (TRP) and one was without TRP. Phosphate solubilization was assessed using Pikovskayaâ€™s media and latter estimated using stannous chloride method, showing decent solubilization of phosphate. Siderophore production was assessed using CAS assay that indicated decent extent of siderophore production. Further for biocontrol, enzymatic assay for Î²-glucanase and chitinase was carried out. For Î²-glucanase enzyme production 1% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and for chitinase enzyme production 10% v/v colloidal chitin (as a sole carbon source) supplemented in solid minimal-medium-9 (MM9) were used. Antagonism effect of isolate M13 was carried out against Aspergillus niger by dual cultural method. As the strain M13 showed several PGP traits, liquid bioformulation was prepared to perform seed germination assay and pot trials on chickpea, followed by field trial on banana plant. All the experimental data of biochemical assessment with pot and field trials suggest T. pinophilus M13 as a novel fungus that can be used as biointensifier."
"Monitoring and evaluating the social and psychological dimensions that contribute to privately protected area program effectiveness Easement; Private Lands; Landowners Privately protected areas (PPAs) make important contributions towards global conservation goals. As with any protected area, PPAs must be monitored for effectiveness at protecting and managing biodiversity. However, the key drivers of maintaining and improving the effectiveness of PPAs are often social, particularly for conservation covenants and easements that are owned and managed by private landholders. In Australia, we surveyed 527 covenant landholders across three states (New South Wales, Tasmania, and Victoria), to provide a benchmark for monitoring and evaluation activities. We found that landholders are mainly motivated to participate in order to protect their land in perpetuity, but come to expect financial and technical assistance as a benefit of the program. While 71.1% (n = 344) reported achieving their land management goals, 44.7% (n = 242) of landholders struggle with covenant management because of age, and financial and time constraints. Covenant landholders are generally satisfied with the program (92%). A subset (8%) of landholders feels disaffected with their participation, relating to their perceived inability to personally manage the biodiversity on their land, and the lack of interaction they have with representatives of covenanting organizations. Where compliance monitoring and semi-annual technical assistance is limited, some landholders are concerned that the efficacy of the covenant is reduced. To increase effectiveness we suggest that PPA programs regularly monitor landholder satisfaction and management needs, schedule conservation actions based on landholder capacity, and utilize landholder networks to spread information and foster communities of stewardship. Additionally, given the older demographics of landholders, programs should engage in PPA successional planning."
"The emerging role of Financial Counsellors in supporting Older Persons in financial hardship and with management of Consumer-directed Care packages within Australia Mental Health; Health Literacy; First Aid The role of financial counsellors as providers of information, support and advocacy for those in financial difficulty is a well established mechanism in the mainstream welfare landscape in Australia. In general, the role of financial counsellors is in helping people alleviate or resolve their financial difficulties through improvement of their financial literacy. It is recognised as an important component of policy responses to assist low-income households and individuals in financial stress. The use of financial counsellors for older persons (i.e., those aged 65+ years) however appears to be underutilised. Financial hardship and abuse of older persons within our community are becoming key issues as the population of Australia â€œagesâ€. Existing evidence also suggests that service providers alone do not have adequate skills to address these issues. This paper firstly examines the development of financial counselling in Australia. It then examines the newly emerging role of financial counselling in supporting older persons in addressing barriers to financial literacy and then in navigating the complex landscape of aged care service provision. The current finacialisation, marketisation and complexities of consumer-directed care are identified as key contextual factors. The paper will then discuss an evaluation study of the provision of financial counselling to the older person population designed to support financial hardship and navigation of the complex aged care services system. The findings of the paper are based on an evaluation of the Financial Consumer Rights Council (FCRC), Victoria: Dignity and Debt Financial Difficulty and Getting Older initiative. This pilot initiative included older persons from both community-based and aged care residential facilities in one regional area of Victoria. The initiative, conducted over 2016, was designed to assess the effectiveness of one-on-one financial counselling sessions with older persons that provided consumer advocacy and information about support services and entitlements (including hardship protections) associated with ageing. The evaluation found that the provision of financial counselling to the older person population could be a key mechanism in improving overall financial literacy, avoiding periods of financial hardship and in maintaining financial well-being, quality of life and positive ageing. Findings also demonstrated a need for an expanded model of outreach financial counselling model to better service older persons in more isolated living environments and/or with mobility impairments living in the community, and the potential to situate offices of financial counsellors within medical centres (a space often visited by the ageing population), to co-situate financial health check-ups as an overall element of health and well-being. As such, financial counselling was viewed as well-placed to support older persons in improvement of financial literacy and in supporting navigation of the increasingly complex marketised and consumer-directed care (CDC) landscape of aged care service provision in Australia."
"Internationalising Research Methods Teaching of Undergraduate Health Professionals Education; Acculturative Stress; Studies Abroad Objective: The project aims were: (1) identifying the pedagogical impact of collaborative student experience on student understanding of research methods and (2) evaluating the perceived value of providing students with an international perspective on their professional practice. Methods: Student cohorts from year 1 of the University of Liverpool (UoL) (n = 80) and year 2 of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University (RMIT) (n = 128) undergraduate Medical Radiation Science degree programmes participated in the intervention as part of their teaching. Students were tasked with designing, deploying, and analysing data from survey-based research projects and invited to provide feedback via an anonymous and voluntary online survey (UoL students) or an equivalent paper-based survey (RMIT students), comprising both quantitative (Likert) and qualitative (open) questions. Results: Responses were received from 83% of RMIT and 31% of UoL students. Over 42% of respondents enjoyed the opportunity to interact with overseas peers, while 14.7% did not; 40% of respondents felt the intervention helped in their understanding of research methods, whilst 28% indicated it had not. The main positive themes were learning the research process, team working skills, networking opportunities, and understanding cultural differences. Interpreting data were invaluable; only a minority valued the engagement with their overseas counterparts. There was poor engagement with social media. Conclusions: Students reported clear value of the innovation for learning research skills and process. The extent of research skills learning supports changes in research activity and culture in the past 10 years. With internationalisation becoming increasingly important in today's health care economy, the degree to which the students identified this aspect of the research as a key learning point highlights the benefits of the active approach. The negative appraisal of the social media support was interpreted as a response to the platform (WhatsApp) and privacy issues with sharing phone numbers."
"Gender Equality Prior to and Following Separation: Nordic and Liberal Policy Inconsistencies One Child Policy; Family Planning Policy; Dual-Earner We compare family policy in Australia and Finland, focusing on child support as interrogating how gender equality ideals and realities play out when families diverge from the dual-parent model. Despite Finland's de-gendered leave and employment policy, a gender wage gap continues to position mothers as primary carers. In Australia, pre-separation policies are gendered in that leave benefits position mothers as primary carers. In both countries, child support policy took the opposite approach. Finland's child support policy provides less incentive for the father to take care of children post-separation."
An Insight into the Characteristic Equation for an Integer Program Multiple Objective Linear Programming; Efficient Set; Integer Programming This article enhances properties and applications associated with the characteristic equation (CE) developed to find an optimal and other ranked-optimal solutions of linear integer programming model. These enhanced properties have applications in the analysis of the multi-objective linear integer programs. The paper also identifies why the CE approach is not possible for some special linear programming (LP) models and creates a challenge for further investigation.
"Towards zero-energy buildings in China: A systematic literature review Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation Zero-energy buildings have attracted interest worldwide as they consume less energy and can alleviate energy shortages caused by rapid economic development. This paper presents a review of the research and development regarding zero-energy buildings in China. First, it briefly introduces the evolution of the definition of zero-energy buildings and discusses the key influencing factors of such buildings in China. Then, envelope design, selection of mechanical and electrical equipment, and solar energy utilization aspects of zero-energy buildings are examined. Additionally, this paper discusses the development and application of zero-energy buildings in China, including project types, design methods, energy resources allocation, and energy operation management. Finally, this paper analyzes China's policies for zero-energy buildings, including incentive mechanisms, laws and regulations, and problems encountered, and provides suggestions for promoting zero-energy buildings in China. We expect this review to identify gaps and future directions for research and development, which will lead to new technologies, methods, policies, and standards that can be applied to zero-energy buildings."
"Invasive weed species’ threats to global biodiversity: Future scenarios of changes in the number of invasive species in a changing climate Maximum Entropy; Ecosystem; Environmental Space Invasive weed species (IWS) threaten ecosystems, the distribution of specific plant species, as well as agricultural productivity. Predicting the impact of climate change on the current and future distributions of these unwanted species forms an important category of ecological research. Our study investigated 32 globally important IWS to assess whether climate alteration may lead to spatial changes in the overlapping of specific IWS globally. We utilized the versatile species distribution model MaxEnt, coupled with Geographic Information Systems, to evaluate the potential alterations (gain/loss/static) in the number of potential ecoregion invasions by IWS, under four Representative Concentration Pathways, which differ in terms of predicted year of peak greenhouse gas emission. We based our projection on a forecast of climatic variables (extracted from WorldClim) from two global circulation models (CCSM4 and MIROC-ESM). Initially, we modeled current climatic suitability of habitat, individually for each of the 32 IWS, identifying those with a common spatial range of suitability. Thereafter, we modeled the suitability of all 32 species under the projected climate for 2050, incorporating each of the four Representative Concentration Pathways (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) in separate models, again examining the common spatial overlaps. The discrimination capacity and accuracy of the model were assessed for all 32 IWS individually, using the area under the curve and true skill statistic rate, with results averaging 0.87 and 0.75 respectively, indicating a high level of accuracy. Our final methodological step compared the extent of the overlaps and alterations under the current and future projected climates. Our results mainly predicted decrease on a global scale, in areas of habitat suitable for most IWS, under future climatic conditions, excluding European countries, northern Brazil, eastern US, and south-eastern Australia. The following should be considered when interpreting these results: there are many inherent assumptions and limitations in presence-only data of this type, as well as with the modeling techniques projecting climate conditions, and the envelopes themselves, such as scale and resolution mismatches, dispersal barriers, lack of documentation on potential disturbances, and unknown or unforeseen biotic interactions."
"Adaptation and validation of the SEGUE checklist to assess osteopathy students' clinical communication skills Patient Care; Medical Students; Bismuth Subnitrate Objective: This paper explores the adaptation and validation of the SEGUE checklist as a tool to assess clinical communication skills in undergraduate osteopathy students in Australia. Methods: A literature review guided instrument selection of the SEGUE tool for the learning, teaching and assessment of clinical communication skills in undergraduate osteopathy students. The SEGUE framework checklist was modified and adapted to meet the practises of undergraduate osteopathy students and a subsequent study was conducted to assess its validity; intra-rater and inter-rater reliability over three time points. Results: A modified SEGUE checklist was developed and validated. Statistical analysis revealed acceptable inter-rater reliability at two time points six weeks apart. Intra-rater reliability revealed moderate to good reliability between the two time points six weeks apart. Testing also revealed scope for further sub-element refinement. Conclusion: The SEGUE checklist has the potential to be suitably adapted for both teaching and assessing clinical communication skills in undergraduate osteopathy students. Further work across a number of universities is needed to add and refine sub-elements of the checklist."
"How does informal entrepreneurship influence the performance of small formal firms? A cross-country institutional perspective Firm; Bribes; Anti-corruption Measures We advance understanding of how competition from informal entrepreneurial firms influences the performance of small formal (registered) firms. We also investigate the role of tax and law related institutions in shaping differently the performance outcomes of the competition between informal and formal firms. Empirical evidence from the analysis of 11,988 observations in 110 emerging countries indicates that, on average, informal firms affect adversely the performance of small formal firms. These negative effects however are stronger in institutional environments with burdensome courts of law but tend to be weaker in environments with burdensome tax regulations. Our analysis extends the rational exit perspective of informality and shows how competition from informal firms affects the performance of small formal firms. It also specifies how contingencies associated with law- and tax-specific institutions across emerging countries influence this relationship."
"Failing to live up to the promise: the politics of equal pay in ‘new’ workplace and industrial relations institutions Political Representation; Quotas; Parliament Workplace and industrial relations regulations are key sites for policy intervention to address Australia's gender pay gap, which, at 15.3 per cent, is almost as large as it was in 1997. In both the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) and the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 (Cth) the goal of equal pay has a more central place than it did in predecessor legislation. In particular, the Fair Work Act has the potential to deliver more gender-equitable wage structures through addressing systemic gender-based undervaluation at the industry level. Adopting a feminist institutional approach this article examines equal pay policy in the operations of workplace and industrial relations regulation to ask why, despite some recent successes, this potential appears unlikely to be realised."
"Eliminating the IMF: An analysis of the debate to keep, reform or abolish the fund IMF; World Bank; Investment Banks This book offers a concise but thorough analysis of the International Monetary Fund reform debate. Since the advent of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, a lengthy deliberation has ensued over whether the IMF should be reformed, abolished, or left as is. The authors approach this debate from a normative perspective while looking at arguments from all sides, as well as reflecting on the history, functions, and ideology of the IMF. This unique approach gives weight to the authorsâ€™ perspectives and their conclusion that the IMF ultimately does more harm than good. Written to analyze and contribute to the current IMF debate, this Palgrave Pivot is a must-read for scholars and policymakers invested in the conversation surrounding IMF reform."
"Improvement of the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of a cyanopyrid-2,6-dione-based donor via molecular engineering Polymer Solar Cells; Polymers; Organic Photovoltaics Through the molecular engineering of cyanopyrid-2,6-dione functionality, herein we report the design and synthesis of a novel, small molecule electron donor, (Z)-5-((5'-(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)-[2,2â€²-bithiophen]-5-yl)methylene)-1-(4-(hexyloxy)phenyl)-4-methyl-2,6-dioxo-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-3-carbonitrile (coded as CP2), which exhibits improved optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties when compared with its structural analogue (E)-5-((5'-(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)-[2,2â€²-bithiophen]-5-yl)methylene)-1-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-methyl-2,6-dioxo-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-3-carbonitrile (coded as CP1). The molecular engineering helps to achieve more desirable energy levels together with bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum, which improves the short-circuit current density. A high conversion efficiency of 6.28% was obtained in simple devices (CP2: PC61BM 1: 1) which is one of the best results in the current literature for cyanopyrid-2,6-dione-based small molecule donors."
"Migrant aged-care workers in Australia: Do they have poorer-quality jobs than their locally born counterparts? Foreign Nurse; Workforce; Health Workers Migrants make up a significant and growing proportion of the aged-care workforce in Australia. Using data from the 2016 National Aged Care Workforce Census and Survey, we investigate employment conditions for Australian-born and overseas-born frontline workers working in residential and home-based aged care, focusing on two key poor job quality indicators. We find that migrant home care workers from non-English-speaking background (NESB) countries are the most likely to be employed on a casual basis and to report hours-related underemployment. Migrant residential care workers from English-speaking background (ESB) countries are more likely to be casual while NESB migrants are more likely to be underemployed. Controlling for a range of employment and socio-demographic characteristics, we find that being an NESB migrant is significantly associated with both casual status and underemployment. Generally, while this association lessens with years spent in Australia, exposure to casual employment is amplified over time for NESB migrants in the residential sector. Holding a temporary visa increased the likelihood of casual employment for residential care workers and underemployment for home care workers. Working for a for-profit employer was also associated with poorer job quality. Further policy shifts in Australia towards temporary migration and increased marketisation of aged care may impact on the working conditions of migrant aged-care workers."
"Digital access, choice and agency in remote Sarawak Mobile Money; Computer Supported Cooperative Work; Developing Countries Internet use and access to digital devices continues to increase even in remote regions around the world, but users do not participate equally or engage in the same practices online. This leads to inequalities in the outcomes different groups of users can generate as a result of their online practices. Drawing from recent literature on digital divides and using a theoretical framework focused on user choice and agency, we present data from a study of internet and device use in remote villages in Sarawak, a state of Malaysia on the island of Borneo. These villages lack most basic infrastructure such as paved roads or grid electricity, but some have mobile phone and mobile internet access installed under Malaysia's Universal Service Provision. We discuss qualitative and quantitative data collected between 2015 and 2017 to point to the opportunities as well as obstacles users in remote communities encounter in their engagements with digital devices and the internet. We argue that while remote areas seem to lag behind urban areas in terms of usersâ€™ internet skills and practices, people choose to engage with these technologies in ways that are appropriate to their needs and to the local low-bandwidth environment. To enable these communities to tap into additional potential benefits of internet use, however, faster and more reliable access is a prerequisite."
"Wet organic waste treatment via hydrothermal processing: A critical review Hydrothermal Liquefaction; Bio-Oil; Biofuel There are several recent reviews published in the literature on hydrothermal carbonization, liquefaction and supercritical water gasification of lignocellulosic biomass and algae. The potential of hydrochar, bio-oil or synthesis gas production and applications have also been reviewed individually. The comprehensive review on the hydrothermal treatment of wet wastes (such as municipal solid waste, food waste, sewage sludge, algae) covering carbonization, liquefaction and supercritical water gasification, however, is missing in the literature which formed the basis of the current review paper. The current paper critically reviews the literature around the full spectrum of hydrothermal treatment for wet wastes and establishes a good comparison of the different hydrothermal treatment options for managing wet waste streams. Also, the role of catalysts as well as synthesis of catalysts using hydrothermal treatment of biomass has been critically reviewed. For the first time, efforts have also been made to summarize findings on modelling works as well as techno-economic assessments in the area of hydrothermal treatments of wet wastes. The study concludes with key findings, knowledge gaps and future recommendations to improve the productivity of hydrothermal treatment of wet wastes, helping improve the commercial viability and environmental sustainability."
"Writing the Feminist Internet: a Chthonian Feminist Internet Theory for the twenty first century Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work This paper analytically responds to the collaborative performance work Writing the Feminist Internet as a motif of fourth wave feminism. It probes at the edge of Internet dark spaces that are often occupied by those who point to complacency in engagement with networking systems, by drawing auxiliary attention to the apparatus. Further examination sheds light on the valences and anarchy of technopolitics that transpired and reflects on the call for â€˜hybrid of feminist activist effortsâ€™ noted by Emma A. Jane. Positing towards â€˜a recalibrated approach to collectivismâ€™ (2015, 285) Jane continues to give rise to a vast communal realm for the expression of alternative behaviours. In building upon the feminist â€˜waveâ€™ metaphor there is acknowledgement that the undercurrents of nautical lineages come to endure through â€˜debt, or inheritanceâ€™ more often than a confluence of flows. The findings reveal that the potency of a chthonic feminist internet theory lies in its indeterminate stance. In conclusion, it is proposed that ambivalence and prominence in obscurity in such expansive â€˜dark social spacesâ€™ is where new meanings and enunciations can brew and be read as a source of critical and aesthetic ambiguity, amongst the highly revered principles of disarray, pandemonium and incompleteness."
"Approximately 1 nm-sized artificial tunnels in wrinkled graphene-graphene oxide composite membranes for efficient dye/dye separation and dye desalination Graphene Oxide; Nanofiltration Membranes; Graphite Efficient separation of solutes by nanofiltration membranes (NMs) is the key to the utilization of wastewater and sustainable economic development. However, the establishment of dense and narrow-dispersed artificial tunnels in NMs remains a challenge, leading to impractical water permeability and solutes selectivity for real-world applications. In this work, we construct approximately 1 nm-sized artificial tunnels within the GO-based membranes (GOMs) to balance the water permeation and nanofiltration performances, by intercalating the three-dimensional wrinkled graphene (WG) sheets with surface functional groups manipulated. Such peculiar nanotunneled structure in the WG/GO composite membrane, at the optimized WG/GO ratio of 1:2, is revealed by the selective filtration of large-sized PEG gel particles over sub-nm-sized counterparts, leading to a selective rejection of >1 nm-sized molecules (e.g. CV, CR, and TB) over sub-nm-sized impurities (e.g. NR, MB, NaCl, and Na2SO4) with excellent mechanical stability and anti-fouling property. More importantly, the dense nanotunneled structure enables the composite membrane with an increased water flux of 65.68 L m-2hâˆ’1 barâˆ’1, which is âˆ¼48 times enhanced compared to that of pure GOM. Our strategy enables the precise engineering of artificial nanotunnels within compact GOM for high-performance dye/dye separation and dye desalination applications."
"Coffee farmer preferences for sustainable agricultural practices: Findings from discrete choice experiments in Vietnam Willingness To Pay; Stated Preference; Best-worst Scaling Despite the proven benefits of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs), adoption rates among farmers are still low, especially in developing countries. This paper seeks to assist policymakers devise approaches to encourage adoption by identifying the attributes of SAPs that can motivate Vietnamese coffee farmers to adopt them in production. Vietnam is the world's second largest coffee producer and the sector supports the livelihoods of over half a million people in the country. We conduct two different types of discrete choice experiments with over 300 Vietnamese coffee farmers to identify their SAP preferences. We analyse the data using cluster analysis and generalised multinomial logit models. The results are consistent across our different approaches. They show that these farmers have the strongest preferences for SAPs that can provide higher profits, lower risks (of output loss) and higher environmental benefits. These attributes received mean part-worth utilities of 0.251, 0.250 and 0.239 respectively. Attributes capturing the increase in daily operating efforts and time required to set up such practices are less important considerations. Further, the farmers are willing to pay on average between 26 and 32 million VND per hectare per year for a one level reduction in the risk of output loss and earn 15 million VND per hectare per year less in profits to achieve a one level increase in environmental benefits."
"Activist ecologies of study in the learning city: deformalisations of educational life Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work The combined impacts of COVID-19 and global climate change are destabilising the infrastructures and future prospects of formal educational systems, with schools and universities struggling to adapt to conditions of radical precarity. At the same time, activist movements are generating alter-educational platforms that reappropriate the learning infrastructures of cities as mobile architectures of pedagogical resistance. Building on Harney and Motenâ€™s The Undercommons, this paper discusses transnational examples of radical pedagogies that engage the city as an ecology of deformalised study. We highlight examples from Melbourneâ€™s COVID-19 lockdown regime, emphasising how informal study enabled community-led responses to crisis at city-scale. We then turn to urban ecologies of study arising from contemporary activist movements, drawing connections between protest movements in Hong Kong and Deleuze and Guattariâ€™s concept of the â€˜war machineâ€™. This leads to a speculative re-imagining of alternative educational values and futures within a milieu of activist study, care, and resistance."
"Optimal parameter estimation in activated sludge process based wastewater treatment practice Activated Sludge; Waste Water; Crack Opening Displacement Activated sludge models (ASMs) are often used in the simulation of the wastewater treatment process to evaluate whether the effluent quality parameters of a wastewater treatment plant meet the standards. The premise of successful simulation is to choose appropriate dynamic parameters for the model. A niche based adaptive invasive weed optimization (NAIWO) algorithm is proposed in this paper to find the appropriate kinetic parameters of activated sludge model 1 (ASM1). The niche idea is used to improve the possibility of convergence to the global optimal solution. In addition, the adaptive mechanism and periodic operator are introduced to improve the convergence speed and accuracy of the algorithm. Finally, NAIWO is used to optimize the parameters of ASM1. Comparison with other intelligent algorithms such as invasive weed optimization (IWO), genetic algorithm (GA), and bat algorithm (BA) showed the higher convergence accuracy and faster convergence speed of NAIWO. The results showed that the ASM1 model results agreed with measured data with smaller errors."
"Productivity in construction industry Labour Productivity; Construction Industry; Crews Since the late 1990s, the construction industry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has lagged behind the rest of the world in actual levels of productivity and productivity growth. This is despite the KSA Governmentâ€™s tremendous support for the construction industry and the expectation that, in the coming decades, the KSA construction industry will continue to develop and grow to achieve the targets of Saudi Vision 2030. This paper explores in depth the concept of productivity to gain insights through answering two questions contextualized within the KSA construction industry: 1) How do managers perceive productivity? and 2) How is productivity measured? Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 senior managers with 10â€“27 yearsâ€™ experience in project management in the KSA construction industry. Qualitative analysis of interview results found that around 40% of interviewees had little or an incorrect understanding of the concept of productivity and its relevance to production processes. This poor understanding of productivity and its measures extends to the lack of clear specific procedures for regular measurement of productivity."
"Technology-Facilitated Sexual Violence: A Literature Review of Empirical Research Stalking; Harassment; Crime Victims Technology-facilitated sexual violence (TFSV) refers to a range of behaviors where digital technologies are used to facilitate both virtual and face-to-face sexually based harms. Such behaviors include online sexual harassment, gender- and sexuality-based harassment, cyberstalking, image-based sexual exploitation, and the use of a carriage service to coerce a victim into an unwanted sexual act. This article reviews the current state of knowledge on these different dimensions, drawing on existing empirical studies. While there is a growing body of research into technology-facilitated harms perpetrated against children and adolescents, there is a dearth of qualitative and quantitative research on TFSV against adults. Moreover, few of the existing studies provide reliable data on the nature, scope, and impacts of TFSV. Preliminary studies, however, indicate that some harms, much like sexual violence more broadly, may be predominantly gender-, sexuality-, and age-based, with young women being overrepresented as victims in some categories. This review collects the empirical evidence to date regarding the prevalence and gender-based nature of TFSV against adults and discusses the implications for policy and programs, as well as suggestions for future research."
"The Effects of Using Pretreated Cotton Gin Trash on the Production of Biogas from Anaerobic Co-Digestion with Cow Manure and Sludge Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production Anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) has been practiced for decades to convert waste into value-added energy products, especially biogas. This study aimed to assess the potential of biogenic methane (CH4) production from the co-digestion of pretreated cotton gin trash (CGT), cow manure, and sludge. CGT contains high cellulosic content, making it a reliable feedstock for biogenic methane production. To further improve the biogas quantity and quality, the CGT was subjected to physical pretreatments, i.e., hot water (HW), ultra-sonication (US), and a combination of both (HW+US). After 91 days of AcoD, 79â€“110 L of biogas was produced by the treatments. Among the treatments, HW+US-pretreated CGT presented maximum biogas production capacity, at 110 L. Besides, this treatment showed the high-quality biogenic CH4 content, 52.4% of the total biogas volume, with an improved conversion rate of 0.37 L/g of volatile suspended solids consumed. In addition, this study discussed the structural changes in feedstock due to pretreatments and correlated them with the corresponding biogenic methane production. The study reports the potential of pretreated CGT conversion to CH4. It will impact the circular economy by contributing to on-farm energy requirements and reducing the financial expenditures incurred in this regard."
"Direct and indirect community effects of the invasive plant pathogen Austropuccinia psidii (myrtle rust) in eastern Australian rainforests Puccinia Psidii; Myrtus; Rust Disease In 2010, the invasive pathogen Austropuccinia psidii was detected in Australia, posing a threat to vegetation communities containing susceptible Myrtaceae species. A large-scale field experiment tested the direct and indirect effects resulting from the infection of two highly susceptible rainforest species, Rhodamnia rubescens and Rhodomyrtus psidioides. Community-level impacts were assessed at three sites per study species in New South Wales, Australia. For R. rubescens, 20 plots containing an adult tree each were established per site. Each plot was designated one of four treatments: fungicide spray of the understorey only, canopy only, both or none (control). For R. psidioides, 10 plots containing only seedlings were established per site, with each plot designated to one of two treatments: fungicide spray or no spray (control). Richness and abundance of co-occurring understorey species were assessed every 4 months for a 24-month period, and changes in canopy transparency were assessed for R. rubescens. The R. rubescens control canopy plots were found to have greater canopy transparency (direct effect) which caused a reduction in the understorey richness and total abundance (indirect effects). For treated canopy plots, richness was similar but total abundance increased in fungicide treated understorey plots, suggesting a direct effect of the pathogen on understorey species. Understorey plots treated with fungicide had significantly greater abundance of R. rubescens and R. psidioides seedlings compared to control plots. This study shows that in a short time period, infection by an invasive fungal pathogen has resulted in changes in species richness and abundance in Australian rainforest communities."
"Extraordinary curtailment of massive typhus epidemic in the Warsaw Ghetto Holocaust; National Socialism; Jew The highly dependent interplay of disease, famine, war, and society is examined based on an extreme period during World War II. Using mathematical modeling, we reassess events during the Holocaust that led to the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto (1941-1942), with the eventual goal of deliberately killing ~450,000, mostly Jewish residents, many through widespread starvation and a large-scale typhus epidemic. The Nazis justified genocide supposedly to control the spread of disease. This exemplifies humanity's ability to turn upon itself, based on racially guided epidemiological principles, merely because of the appearance of a bacterium. Deadly disease and starvation dynamics are explored using modeling and the maths of food ration cards. Strangely, the epidemic was curtailed and was brought to a sudden halt before winter, when typhus normally accelerates. A far more massive epidemic outbreak was prevented through the antiepidemic efforts by the often considered incompetent and corrupt ghetto leadership and the Herculean efforts of ghetto doctors."
"Application of a harmonized life cycle assessment method for supplementary cementitious materials in structural concrete Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Substitution of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), such as fly ash and slag, can reduce energy consumption, thus a consequent depletion in carbon footprint. While there are some methods available for assessing sustainability, most studies considered only one or two aspects. Due to a lack of integration and uncertainty analysis, it is difficult for decision-makers to integrate possible mechanical, environmental, economic, and social measures for concrete selection. Therefore, this study performs regression analysis and Monte Carlo simulations on mechanical properties of concrete with different mix proportions of SCMs. The probabilistic distribution of uncertainty analysis shows concrete strength has a higher association with cement mix (r > 0.8) than slag (r = 0.77) and fly ash (r = 0.63) mixes. Harmonized method of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) has been presented to categorize impacts from short-term to long-term perspectives in terms of human health damage (DALY), ecosystem damage (species.year), and resource availability ($) to take care of both environmental and social aspects. Single objective Pareto analysis determines cement's optimum replacement can happen with 20% fly ash and 30% slag. A total reduction of 2745 megatons CO2 and monetary savings of 209 billion dollars is feasible by replacing 50% of the produced cement globally (4.1 gigatons) with SCMs, which can be rewarded for human health and ecological recoveries."
"Put My Skills to Use? Understanding the Joint Effect of Job Security and Skill Utilization on Job Satisfaction Between Skilled Migrants and Australian Born Workers in Australia Job Insecurity; Personnel; Perceived Employability The topic of skilled migrants has gained importance in the past decade as they are increasingly becoming one of the main drivers for labor supply in developed countries like Australia. Although there is research on skilled migrants, most have been studied from the perspectives of (un)employment, wage and over-education. Some evidence suggests that skilled migrants are often less satisfied with their job compared to their local counterparts, yet little is known about why these differences exist. Using a nationally representative sample of Australian workers, we examine how two important job characteristics, job security and skill utilization, exert their differential interaction effect on job satisfaction for skilled migrants and Australian born workers. We found a differential moderation effect between job security and skill utilization for skilled migrants and Australian born workers. For skilled migrants, high job security did not lead to positive reaction (i.e., job satisfaction), as this effect was dependent on their skill utilization; while such moderation effect was not present for Australian born workers. This study highlights the need to take a more fine-tuned approach by understanding target sample groups (e.g., skilled migrants) when study the relationship between key job characteristics and job satisfaction. Furthermore, it highlights the importance for organizations to revisit their human resource management strategies and policies to recognize the needs for enhancing skill utilization for skilled migrants."
"Assessing two large area burnt area products across Australian southern forests Biomass Burning; Remote Sensing; Wildfires Burnt area is a critical parameter for estimating emissions of greenhouse gases associated with biomass burning. Several burnt area products (BAPs) derived from Earth Observation satellites/sensors have been released; these are based on different spatial resolutions and derived using different methodologies so that accuracies can vary amongst them. This study validates a global (MODIS) and a national (AVHRR) BAP across Australian southern forests using two reference datasets: state fire histories (SFHs) from 2000 to 2013 and a forest cover map derived through high resolution air photo interpretation (API). The spatial and temporal agreement between fires in the BAPs and reference SFH were analysed based on 2610 sample points representative of Australian southern forest types (successful detection was evaluated according to fire type: planned burn vs. wildfire, size of fire, and land tenure). Results show that both BAPs were most successful when identifying large wildfires (>5000 ha). Overall accuracy for AVHRR and MODIS was 73.9% and 62.5%, respectively. When compared to the API derived forest cover map as reference dataset, both products achieved higher overall accuracies (94.1% for AVHRR and 87.1% for MODIS); an expected result given that the fires detected in this dataset are known to be observable using Earth observation data. But regardless of reference dataset, the AVHRR BAP which is tailored to Australian conditions achieved better results than the MODIS global BAP. Also, the AVHRR archive in Australia goes back to 1988, which is an important consideration for calculating wildfire history for greenhouse gas accounting."
"Soil greenhouse gas emissions from Australian sports fields Greenhouse Gas; Nitrification Inhibitors; Soil Emission Managed turf is a potential net source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While most studies to date have focused on non-sports turf, sports turf may pose an even greater risk of high GHG emissions due to the generally more intensive fertiliser, irrigation and mowing regimes. This study used manual and automated chambers to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions from three sports fields and an area of non-sports turf in southern Australia. Over 213 days (autumn to late spring), the average daily N2O emission was 37.6 g N haâˆ’1dayâˆ’1 at a sports field monitored at least weekly and cumulative N2O emission was 2.5 times higher than the adjacent non-sports turf. Less frequent seasonal sampling at two other sports fields showed average N2O daily emission ranging from 26 to 90 g N haâˆ’1 dayâˆ’1. Management practices associated with periods of relatively high N2O emissions were surface renovation and herbicide application. CH4 emissions at all of the sports fields were generally negligible with the exception of brief periods when soil was waterlogged following heavy rainfall where emissions of up to 1.3 kg C haâˆ’1 dayâˆ’1 were recorded. Controlled release and nitrification inhibitor containing fertilisers didn't reduce N2O, CH4 or CO2 emissions relative to urea in a short term experiment. The N2O emissions from the sports fields, and even the lower emissions from the non-sports turf, were relatively high compared to other land uses in Australia highlighting the importance of accounting for these emissions at a national level and investigating mitigation practices."
"Diagnostic analysis of a single-cell Proton Exchange Membrane unitised regenerative fuel cell using numerical simulation Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC); Diffusion in Gases; Electrode Fabrication and testing of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells to improve performance is an expensive and time-consuming process. This paper presents a novel procedure for using computer simulation â€“ namely the ANSYS PEM Fuel Cell Module â€“ to identify key performance limiting factors in fuel cell mode of a PEM Unitised Regenerative Fuel cell (URFC) fabricated at RMIT by comparing its performance with a higher performing URFC reported in the literature. The diagnostic analysis is performed in two steps: firstly, changing operating conditions to ensure both cells are compared based on the same conditions; secondly identifying differences in cell properties, specifically catalyst exchange current densities and membrane conductivity. The simulation results show that applying the more optimal operating conditions of the higher performing cell doubled the maximum power of the RMIT cell (from 0.163 W/cm2 to 0.327 W/cm2). To overcome the remaining performance deficit in the ohmic polarization region, the value of the protonic conduction coefficient in the modelled RMIT cell had to be increased. Overall the study indicates that computer simulation modelling, in conjunction with carefully focussed experiments, can be a very useful tool in diagnosing fuel-cell performance problems."
"Cumulative Impacts of Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: Experimental Evidence from Indonesia Child Labor; Family Characteristic; School Attendance Conditional cash transfers provide income and promote human capital investments. Yet evaluating their longitudinal impacts is hard, as most experimental evaluations treat control locations after a few years. We examine such impacts in Indonesia after six years, where the program rollout left the experiment largely intact. We find static effects on many targeted indicators: childbirth using trained professionals increased dramatically, and under- 15 children not in school fell by half. We observe impacts requiring cumulative investments: stunting fell by 23 percent. While human capital accumulation increased, the transfers did not lead to transformative economic change for recipient households. (JEL I21, I38, J13, J24, O15)"
"Designing with nature-based solutions to mitigate flooding in mataniko river catchment, honiara Flood Damage; Flooding; Natural Hazards With increasing population and pressure on land resources in the wake of climate change in Oceanic Cities, working locally with ecosystems through nature-based solutions can be a practical approach towards resilient landscapes. Extreme weather conditions and rainfall events as inevitable consequences of the future change require landscape designers to stay abreast of technology in hydrology and hydraulic modelling. This paper illustrates experimental landscape interventions to redesign topographic configurations in Adobe Photoshop that offers unlimited opportunities for developing scenarios for flood mitigation. Through the coupling of GIS with a program that models the hydraulics of water flow, a method to familiarise designers with flood impacts using an iterative and scientifically informed design process is proposed. We conclude through the proposed workflow that the application of nature-based solutions was effective in reducing the water depth in flood events by 6.67 meters in vulnerable areas of the catchment occupied by informal settlements."
"Mathematical modelling and exergo-environmental analysis of drying potato samples in a waste heat-based convective dryer Thin-Layer Drying; Drying; Solar Dryers Understanding the drying kinetics within a food dryer is an important step towards its improvement. This study investigates the drying kinetics of potato slices in a recently proposed waste-heat based convective dryer. Statistical analyses are conducted for ten dissimilar mathematical models to choose the best fit model for the experimental data at various drying temperatures (70 Â°C, 60 Â°C, and 50 Â°C). Results show that the Midilli et al. model is the best fit model to describe the drying kinetics of potato in the proposed dryer as it offers root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0022, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.99, reduced chi-square (Ï‡2) of 9.2 Ã—10âˆ’7. Results also demonstrate that the activation energy is 47.19 kJâ„mol and the effective moisture diffusivity of dried potato sample is 4.22 Ã—10âˆ’10 to 11.67 Ã— 10âˆ’10 m2/s at a drying air temperature of 50â€“70 Â°C. Moreover, if the proposed waste-heat based convective dryer is used instead of an electric convective dryer at 60 Â°C, it can reduce the external energy requirement by 29.98 MJ/kg. Exergo-environmental analysis of the proposed dryer shows that the CO2 emission and CO2 mitigation values for 20-year life cycle periods are 184.46 kg/year and 17.24 tons, respectively. Therefore, successful industrial application of the proposed drying system might be a striding stone towards the advancement of energy-efficient sustainable food drying systems."
"Value as capital-in-use: Unpacking the temporal impacts and managerial implications for organisational value Product-service Systems; Service Economy; Value Co-Creation Value is a widely researched and much debated topic, but one still characterised by conceptual deficiencies. While multiple competing value perspectives exists in the current literature, they provide limited insights in terms of temporal impacts and implications for organisational value creation. To address this gap, this conceptual article develops the notion of value as capital-in-use, which complements extant value literature by providing a capital-oriented perspective and conceptualisation of the nature, characteristics, and dimensions of value. We develop the concept by reviewing four categories of capital (physical, financial, knowledge, and social), and unpacking their dimensions in terms of locus, latency, temporality and convertibility, to distinguish the implications they each hold as potential sources of organisational value. Variations in the properties of the four categories of capital have management implications that are typically poorly recognised, especially in terms of costs and risk associated with latent or perishable capital. This paper contributes to current value theory by establishing its relationship to capital, and extending coverage of the temporal dimension of value."
"Towards applying virtual reality techniques in fostering blended learning of the construction technology Game-Based Learning; Educational Games; Serious Game Effective learning of building technology is stemming from persistent practices in transforming information from construction drawings to appropriate responses in compliance with the industry standards and the government requirements. This type of training has been delivered in a conventional fashion involving formal lectures and studios-based practice sessions. Nevertheless, learners usually lack construction site experience and demand for more intensive guidance to understand the learning materials they received in classes. Unfortunately, this issue is more critical as professional trainers or academics in this area with sufficient industry experience is not readily available. Devising more effective training in construction technology shall be invaluable for the learners, trainers and the construction industry itself. Research findings suggest that virtual reality (VR) environment engender learners to make more references to critical thinking and higher-order cognition in compare to conventional teaching methods. In engineering education context, VR improves learnersâ€™ understanding about spatial arrangements and the link between two-dimensional and three-dimensional environment. A literature review that identified the types of VR techniques in application to construction education and professional training was conducted. Strengths and weaknesses of these applications were compared. The findings suggest that not all VR techniques are effective on fostering blended learning with integration among real-life construction site environment. A more effective form of VR technique should address the limitation of hardware, class size and conditions."
"Factors associated with Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu) in North Central Province of Sri Lanka: a comparative analysis of drinking water samples Chronic Kidney Failure; Fructokinases; Sri Lanka Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu) is a major health concern in North Central Province (NCP) of Sri Lanka. Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa are the two most affected districts in NCP. This research was designed to identify main suspected CKDu causative agents in drinking water in NCP. Drinking water samples were collected from shallow wells of CKDu patients and non-patients in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts. They were tested for chemical ions: chloride, fluoride, nitrate, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, sodium, cadmium and arsenic. An analytical framework was developed to analyse water quality data using statistical methods, namely univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnettâ€™s T3 post hoc test, Kruskalâ€“Wallis (KW) and Mannâ€“Whitneyâ€™s post hoc test, discriminant analysis, factorial analysis followed by reliability tests. ANOVA, KW and their post hoc tests were applied to show the significant differences at p < 0.05 in mean and median values of chemical constituents between CKDu patient and non-patient samples. Discriminant analysis was applied to show the degree of accuracy in original sampling groups. Factorial analysis was applied to identify the ion combinations in each group. A secondary set of data obtained from drinking water samples of CKDu endemic and non-endemic areas were also analysed independently using the same analytical techniques to compare the results."
"Graphene-assisted construction of electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction Carbon Dioxide; Electrocatalysts; Chemical Reduction The electrochemical conversion of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), to energy fuels and value-added chemicals presents one of the most valuable approaches to harvest pollutants and produce renewable energy. However, the stable molecular structure of CO2 and the sluggish reaction kinetics make CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) formidably challenging to achieve reaction rate and selectivity practical in industry. Graphene and its derivatives have been considered a group of intriguing materials to develop advanced CO2RR electrocatalysts due to their large specific surface area, remarkable electron transfer ability, superior stability, and easy tunability of the structure and surface properties. Herein, we comprehensively discuss the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts constructed with graphene and derivatives for active and selective CO2RR within the recent five years, mainly including the electrocatalysts with both metal-based (e.g., noble, non-noble, or combined thereof) and non-metal (e.g., doped, modified, defected, or composited) catalytic sites. To present the versatile, high-performance metal-based CO2RR electrocatalysts constructed with graphene, we further subdivide them according to the sizes, oxidation states, metal species synergies, dimensionalities, and versatility. Finally, we provide the challenges and perspectives in this emerging area of utilising CO2 to produce various carbon-based fuels and chemicals via graphene chemistry."
"Extraction of γ-Oryzanol from defatted rice bran using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2): Process optimisation of extract yield, scale-up and economic analysis Gamma Oryzanol; Black Rice; Extract Sustainable agricultural practises ensure production of quality products having negligible environmental impacts replacing conventional techniques. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCâˆ’CO2) extraction, a replacement to flammable, toxic, non-ecological solvent extraction was carried out in this study to extract Î³-oryzanol, a potent bioactive ingredient, from defatted rice bran. The response surface methodology was applied to optimize the handling parameters such as temperature, pressure and CO2 flow rate. Extraction of Î³-oryzanol is investigated at low pressures (such as 15, 20 and 25 MPa) compared to previous studies. The highest (optimum) yield of Î³-oryzanol was 36,000 mg.kgâˆ’1 at 10 w/w% of ethanol as co-solvent and the corresponding temperature, pressure and CO2 flow rate were 48.9 Â°C, 23.9 MPa and 29.8 g.minâˆ’1, respectively. The techno-economic assessment using Aspen plus software evaluated the return of investment of the plant processing 3000 tonnes of rice bran per year accounts for a net present value almost double the investment cost having a payback period of around 5 years."
"The science and politics of climate risk assessment in Australia's Murray Darling Basin Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Climate change has many disruptive consequences, particularly in large river basins experiencing drying trends and declining water availability. With pressure for more adaptive policies, understanding how institutions governing water are adapting to climate risks has broad international relevance. This paper examines the challenges of climate risk assessments in Australia's Murray Darling Basin, an economically and culturally important basin where national legislation mandates a Basin Plan based on the best available science. However, despite repeated scientific warnings about a drying climate, the current Basin Plan does not reduce estimates of water resources available, and its climate risk management relies on a bricolage of policy mechanisms, which appear insufficient for the magnitude of predicted changes. This paper outlines the findings of original research exploring why this occurred. It draws on interviews with 30 senior public policy professionals and researchers with deep experience in climate and water policy. The interview data indicate that minimising political risks were the principal reasons for abandoning proposed reductions in entitlements and for relying on historical averages for estimating water availability. As the reform process evolved, decisions about water-planning techniques became increasingly politicised, and the adoption of explicit climate adaptation measures became problematic. As a result, the Basin Plan neither reflects the broad scientific consensus about climate change nor makes specific allowances for declining water availability. Climate risks are downplayed while concerns about levels of scientific uncertainties appear overstated. Importantly, lessons emerge from this examination that could contribute to the revisions of the Plan, scheduled for 2026. More generally, the research finds that proactive climate adaptation policies for large river basins require sustained and well-designed institutional reforms, particularly the adoption of legally prescribed procedures for utilising science - and accounting for its use - in controversial environmental reforms."
"Microbial fuel cell-upflow biofilter coupling system for deep denitrification and power recovery: Efficiencies, bacterial succession and interactions Bioenergy; Regenerative Fuel Cells; Bioelectricity The excess organic carbon is often added to meet denitrification requirements during municipal wastewater treatment, resulting in the carbon waste and increased risk of secondary pollution. In this study, microbial fuel cell (MFC) was coupled with an up-flow denitrification biofilter (BF), and the long-term performances of denitrification and power output were investigated under the different carbon source concentration. With sodium acetate (NaAc) of 600 mg/L and 300 mg/L, the favorable denitrification efficiencies were obtained (98.60%) and the stable current output was maintained (0.44 mÃƒ0.48 mA). By supplying NaAc of 150 mg/L, the high denitrification efficiency remained in a high range (89.31%) and the current output maintained at 0.12 mA, while, the denitrification efficiency dropped to 71.34% without coupling MFC. Electron balance analysis indicated that both nitrate removal and electron recovery efficiencies were higher in MFC-BF than that in BF, verifying the improved denitrification and carbon utilization performance. Coupling MFC significantly altered the bacterial community structure and composition, and while, the diversified abundance and distribution of bacterial genera were observed at the different locations. Compared with BF, the more exoelectrogenic genera (Desulfobacterium, Trichococcus) and genera holding both denitrifying and electrogenic functions (Dechloromonas, Geobacter) were found dominated in MFC-BF. Instead, the dominating genera in BF were Dechloromonas, Desulfomicrobium, Acidovorax and etc. By coupling MFC, the more complex and diversified network and the closer interaction relationships between the dominant potential functional genera were found. The study provides a feasible approach to effectively improve the denitrification efficiency and organic carbon recovery for deep denitrification process."
"Data-driven Optimisation of in vivo Radioactive Source-tracking for Real-time Cancer Radiotherapy Treatment Verification Brachytherapy; Radiosurgery; Radiotherapy Precise treatment delivery in high dose rate radiation therapy for prostate cancer requires comprehensive treatment verification to ensure effective tumour control and patient safety. Our group has developed a system that tracks the radiation source as it moves inside the patient's tumour. The major aim of this study was to optimise the source-tracking algorithm to improve accuracy without excessive cost in processing time to enable real-time analysis. The source is tracked by analysing the distribution of radiation from the brachytherapy source (Iridium-192) that exits the patient's skin and reaches a Flat Panel Detector (FPD) mounted in the couch beneath the patient. The radiation distribution in this 2-dimensional 'image' is analysed to estimate the source position. In this study, measurements were conducted in a 'phantom' - an artificial surrogate for the patient - in which the ground-truth positions were known by an independent means that cannot be achieved in a live patient. Various algorithms were examined for accuracy, efficiency, and the influence of asymmetric radiation scattering caused by inhomogeneous media interfaces e.g. air/tissue boundaries. The most accurate algorithm was identified, and some tunable parameters were able to be optimised for accuracy. The comparison of measured source positions revealed some skewing of measured positions due to asymmetric scattering existing in the proximity of the phantom edge. The algorithm with the lowest sensitivity to asymmetric scattering was identified. Computation times were compared for suitability in the clinical environment where evaluation at up to 30 frames per second may be required. The optimised algorithms could improve the quality assurance value of source-position tracking in high dose rate brachytherapy."
"Cost-oriented planning of equipment for selective laser melting (SLM) in production lines Fused Deposition Modeling; Mechanical Properties; 3D Printers Equipment for selective laser melting (SLM) has mainly been developed for applications in rapid prototyping. This paper provides a methodology for a cost-oriented optimisation and planning of SLM equipment for series production lines. The approach thus supports the transition to more productive and cost-efficient equipment. The paper presents a two-step methodology: at first, setup time is reduced using heuristic rules based on the activity node network plan. Afterwards, the build-up time is optimised by cost and performance parameters like laser power and build chamber size. Using the presented methodology rules for a cost-oriented SLM-equipment can be derived."
"Praziquantel use in aquaculture – Current status and emerging issues Dactylogyrus; Fish; Praziquantel Parasitic diseases are major constraints in fish mariculture. The anthelmintic praziquantel (PZQ) can effectively treat a range of flatworm parasites in a variety of fish species and has potential for broader application than its current use in the global aquaculture industry. In this review we report on PZQ's current use in the aquaculture industry and discuss its efficacy against various flatworm parasites of fish. Routes of PZQ administration are evaluated, along with issues related to palatability, pharmacokinetics and toxicity in fish, while PZQ's effects on non-target species, environmental impacts, and the development of drug-resistance are discussed."
"Helmert-VCE-aided fast-WTLS approach for global ionospheric VTEC modelling using data from GNSS, satellite altimetry and radio occultation Global Positioning System; Ionospherics; Ionosondes Vertical total electron content (VTEC) global ionospheric maps (GIM) are commonly used to correct the ionospheric delay of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals for single-frequency positioning and other ionospheric studies. The measurements observed by inhomogeneously distributed ground reference stations are the only data used to generate the GIMs. Thus the accuracy of the GIMs over ocean and polar regions is relatively poor due to the lack of measurements over these regions. In this study, space-borne VTECs obtained from ocean-altimetry and GNSS radio occultation measurements are incorporated into the modelling process. Since the three types of VTEC data have different qualities, the weight for each type of data is determined using the Helmert-variance component estimation (Helmert-VCE) method. In addition, unlike the traditional weighted least squares (WLS) estimation method in which the design matrix of observation equations is fixed, in this study, the design matrix, especially those elements in design matrix that are derived from the coordinates of either tangent point or ionospheric pierce point, are considered to be inaccurate. Thus they are adjusted together with the unknown coefficient parameters of the fitting model using the fast-weighted total least squares (fast-WTLS) technique. The proposed approach, named Helmert-WTLS, was tested using the data in the period of day of year (DOY) 217â€“224, 2016 and validated using GIMs produced by the research team for ionosphere and precise positioning based on BDS/GNSS (GIPP) at the Academy of Opto-Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Comparison results showed that the GIMs (with a 2 h temporal resolution) generated using the new approach can improve the determination of ionospheric TEC by 0.28 TEC units (TECU) over those from the Helmert-VCE-aided WLS approach (w.r.t CAS references, respectively) and by 1.61 TECU better than those from WLS, in terms of the mean of all root-mean-squares errors of all 2 h time slots in the 8-day testing period. In addition, in comparison with out-of-sample Jason-3 observations, results from the proposed method also outperformed Helmert-VCE-aided WLS, CAS and CODE models by 1.5, 2.4 and 2.4 TECU, respectively."
"Modelling of supply chain disruption analytics using an integrated approach: An emerging economy example Disruption; Supply Chain Disruptions; Dual Sourcing The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework to identify, analyze, and to assess supply chain disruption factors and drivers. Based on an empirical analysis, four disruption factor categories including natural, human-made, system accidents, and financials with a total of sixteen disruption drivers are identified and examined in a real-world industrial setting. This research utilizes an integrated approach comprising both the Delphi method and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). To test this integrated method, one of the well-known examples in industrial contexts of developing countries, the ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh is considered. To evaluate this industrial example, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to ensure the robustness and viability of the framework in practical settings. This study not only expands the literature scope of supply chain disruption risk assessment but through its application in any context or industry will reduce the impact of such disruptions and enhance the overall supply chain resilience. Consequently, these enhanced capabilities arm managers the ability to formulate relevant mitigation strategies that are robust and computationally efficient. These strategies will allow managers to take calculated decisions proactively. Finally, the results reveal that political and regulatory instability, cyclones, labor strikes, flooding, heavy rain, and factory fires are the top six disruption drivers causing disruptions to the ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh."
"Temporary homes in disaster hit areas Temporary Housing; Disaster; Tsunamis Temporary housing plays a critical role in post disaster recovery efforts but due to their unsustainability, cultural inadequacies, and being expensive they are not seen as a suitable resolution Thus, due to the need of an integrated and more responsive strategy has becomes evident to better utilize the recovery and relief resources. The ami of this research is to explore use of the temporary housing in the post-disaster situations by addressing both physical and psycho-social safety/health issues and potential solutions to improve implementation of temporary housing. Furthermore, this research determines the, re-use and recycle, potential of temporary housing units after occupancy in post-recovery areas. This research also tries to identify how deconstruction is utilized and the benefits in post-disaster situations and determine the role and effectiveness of community participation during the post-disaster recovery situations. In the first part, this paper mtroduces the topic, then delivers the state of the art literature survey. Paper also justifies the chosen methodology followed by discussion and conclusion."
"Predicting Mobility as a Service (MaaS) use for different trip categories: An artificial neural network analysis Car Sharing; Bike; Autonomous Vehicles Mobility as a Service (MaaS) has gained popularity as a means of sustainable urban transport which makes the understanding of MaaS use critical for its design and promotion. Studies have contributed to the growing understanding of MaaS, its design features, and consumersâ€™ willingness to pay for MaaS in general, without recourse to the differences in traveling for work, social and general purposes. This paper develops and tests models to predict MaaS use by applying artificial neural network analysis, following the cross industry standard process and data mining framework. It also estimates separate models for social, general, and work trips, using 33 input variables reflecting network externality, transaction cost, behaviour, institutional, environmental concern, personal travel, and socio-economic factors. Data are collected from a survey of 331 Australians. The study reveals different sets of socio-economic factors, the impact of Covid-19, and personal travel factors as key predictors of MaaS use for general, social, and work trips with an average prediction accuracy of 68%, 68%, and 75% respectively. The findings can be used to inform strategies and policies on how to attract a user base with respect to socio-economic and personal travel factors for promoting MaaS use."
"Dynamic buckling of functionally graded graphene nanoplatelets reinforced composite shallow arches under a step central point load Arches; Buckling; Steel This paper presents dynamic buckling analysis for a functionally graded graphene nanoplatelets reinforced composite (FG-GPLRC) arch subjected to a step central point load at its center. The arch is composed of multiple composite layers reinforced with graphene nanoplatelets (GPLs) which are evenly distributed in each layer while the GPL weight fraction changes from layer to layer along the thickness direction. The effective materials properties are predicted by Halpin-Tsai micromechanics model for each GPLRC layer. Analytical solutions for symmetric limit point dynamic buckling load and anti-symmetric bifurcation dynamic buckling load for fixed and pinned FG-GPLRC arches are obtained by using energy-based methods. The critical geometric parameters governing the dynamic buckling mode switching behavior are also identified and discussed. It is found that the dynamic stability of the arch can be considerably improved by adding a small amount of GPLs as reinforcing nanofillers, and both symmetric limit point dynamic buckling and anti-symmetric bifurcation dynamic buckling can happen to pinned FG-GPLRC arch while the fixed FG-GPLRC arch can buckle in a symmetric mode only. The influences of GPLs distribution, concentration, dimension of GPL as well as the arch geometrical parameters on the dynamic buckling behavior of FG-GPLRC arches are comprehensively investigated through parametric studies."
"Soil carbon density can increase when Australian savanna is converted to pasture, but may not change under intense cropping systems Soil Organic Carbon; China; Carbon Sinks Savanna regions are increasingly developed for agriculture to support population growth, food demand and export economies. This is driving interest in the conversion of natural savanna to cattle grazed pastures or horticultural crops in Northern Australia. Savanna clearing leads to aboveground carbon (C) loss but impacts below-ground are less certain as studies have focused on high rainfall regions, low reactive clay soils and shallow depths of 0.3 m or less. To examine impact of land use change (LUC) in Northern Australia, we sampled the upper 1.0 m soil profile of: 1) savanna woodlands, 2) old and young C4 perennial cattle grazed pastures and 3) old and young, melon-sorghum rotation fields. Soil C concentrations and soil bulk density in the upper 0.3 m were significantly greater in cattle grazed pastures than savanna woodland, such that savanna to pasture LUC significantly increased soil C density from 30.2 Â± 1.5â€“43.4 Â± 3.0 Mg C ha-1 over 28 years. Soil bulk density in the upper 0.7 m of savanna woodland was significantly less than that in the melon-sorghum rotations. In contrast, soil C concentrations below 0.5 m were significantly greater in the savanna woodland than in the 3 y.o. melon-sorghum rotation fields. There was no significant difference in soil C density between savanna woodland and 12 y.o. melon-sorghum rotations. This may relate to the beneficial effects of ploughing in sorghum as a green manure, or simply that the decrease in soil C concentration was offset by increased soil C density in the upper layers of soil where most C is located. In contrast, conversion of savanna to cattle grazed pasture sites is equivalent to a soil sequestration rate of 0.34 Mg C ha-1 y-1, approximately 50% of the observed net ecosystem productivity estimated using eddy covariance methods. Changing the depth to which soil C density was estimated changed significant differences amongst land-use systems. Whereas, estimating soil C density using a â€˜fixed depthâ€™ or â€˜equivalent massâ€™ method did not change the statistical significance. There is an increasing focus on the potential of soil carbon sequestration especially in north Australia and understanding potential change and impact of accounting methods is essential for meaningful policy development. Policy settings to maintain, or improve, soil C storage and soil health may contradict agricultural development goals."
"Competitive Green Supply Chain Transformation with Dynamic Capabilities—An Exploratory Case Study of Chinese Electronics Industry Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices Extant studies identify different strategic approaches for businesses to integrate environment management (EM) into corporate supply chain management (SCM) to create different competitive market advantages. With increasing market uncertainties, stakeholder complexities, constraints of resources, companies nowadays are required to develop more context-specific solutions for mitigating sustainability risk and improving market performance in supply chain sustainability practices. To address the challenges faced by businesses, this study aims to explore how a company adapts green supply chain strategies for a competitive transformation. Specifically, we aim to identify different green supply chain capabilities that form hybrid choices of green solutions for a company to leverage an adaptive green shift. Through an extensive literature review, this study proposes a conceptual framework for exploration which is based on a qualitative in-depth case study in the electronics industryâ€”one of the most polluting manufacturing sectors in China. The findings show that supply chain characteristics play a significant role in the selection of different green SCM solutions by businesses. We find different hybrid choices of strategic decisions are being made by the case company operating with high-volume and high-value supply chains respectively. High-volume supply chains adopt both operational pollution and waste control strategies and incremental green product strategies to balance cost of operational change and develop a competitive eco-efficient market expansion. In contrast, high-value supply chains adopt radical green product innovation strategies and operational waste prevention strategies to balance cost of product innovation and build operational efficiency to expand in a competitive eco-differentiation market. A mix of dynamic capabilities involved in different supply chain green transformations are also identified."
"Surprising Pseudogobius: Molecular systematics of benthic gobies reveals new insights into estuarine biodiversity (Teleostei: Gobiiformes) Animals; Maccullochella Macquariensis; Percichthyidae Snubnose gobies (genus Pseudogobius: Gobionellinae) are ubiquitous to, and important components of, estuarine ecosystems of the Indo-west Pacific. These small benthic fishes occur in freshwater, brackish and marine habitats such as mangroves, sheltered tide pools and lowland streams, and represent a model group for understanding the biodiversity and biogeography of estuarine fauna. To develop the species-level framework required for a concurrent morphological taxonomic appraisal, we undertook thorough sampling around the extensive Australian coastline, referenced to international locations, as part of a molecular systematic review using both nuclear and mitochondrial markers. The results indicate that while there are currently eight recognised species, the true diversity is close to double this, with a hotspot of endemism located in Australia. Complicated patterns were observed in southern Australia owing to two differing zones of introgression/admixture. Key drivers of diversity in the group appear to include plate tectonics, latitude, and historic barriers under glacial maxima, where an interplay between ready dispersal and habitat specialisation has led to regional panmixia but frequent geographic compartmentalisation within past and present landscapes. The findings have significant implications for biodiversity conservation, coastal and estuarine development, the basic foundations of field ecology, and for applied use such as in biomonitoring."
"A framework and simple decision support tool for groundwater contamination assessment in an urban redevelopment precinct Brownfield Redevelopment; Brownfields; Contaminated Land Overcoming barriers to large-scale urban redevelopment on brownfield land is an essential step in the global drive toward achieving the UNâ€™s sustainable development goals. Arguably the most significant barrier is site contamination. Decision support tools (DSTs) are potentially effective ways to assess contaminated sites and evaluate different remediation/management strategies as appropriate to local conditions. Whilst there has been extensive development of DSTs for single contaminated sites, only a limited number are available for assessing contamination at the â€˜precinctâ€™ (district) scale. This paper presents a framework and simple DST for the assessment of contaminated groundwater, using Australiaâ€™s largest urban redevelopment project, Fishermans Bend in Melbourne, as a case study. The value of the inclusion of precinct-wide data into individual site-scale investigations is demonstrated via the DST. Common contaminant sources identified across Fishermans Bend include fill contaminated with heavy metals, legacy landfill leachate containing heavy metals and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and naturally occurring ammonia and methane in organic-rich sediments. By comparison, point sources of heavy metals and PFAS appear related to industrial sources. By using the DST, environmental practitioners and auditors can more effectively separate background conditions from point sources, characterise the ambient conditions of the aquifer and their relationships to natural and anthropogenic processes, and use contaminant data to inform remedial options assessment. Where these increasingly complex and varied environmental datasets can be collected, stored and managed within one central database, cross- or inter-disciplinary collaborations may drive improvements in solving environmental problems which typically arise during the redevelopment process."
"Microbiological quality assessment of milk at different stages of the dairy value chain in a developing country setting Animals; Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome; Serotypes The main objective of the study was to assess the microbiological quality of milk at different stages of the dairy value chain from farm to the factory in Bangladesh. A total of 438 raw milk samples (387 from primary producers, 32 from collectors, 15 from chilling plants, 4 from local restaurants) and 95 commercially processed milk samples were collected from northern part of Bangladesh. Almost 72% (n = 280) of samples at producer level and 100% from both collectors (n = 32) and chilling plants (n = 15) were contaminated with coliforms while 57% (n = 220) of samples from producers, 91% (n = 29) of samples from collectors and 100% (n = 15) from chilling plants were contaminated with fecal coliforms. Around 31% (n = 119) of samples from producers were positive for E. coli whereas >60% (n = 20) and 100% (n = 15) samples from collectors and chilling plants, respectively were positive for E. coli. One quarter of samples from collectors were positive for B. cereus and coagulase positive staphylococci and 33% (n = 5) of samples from chilling plants were positive for both of these microorganisms. In case of commercially processed milk, 77% (n = 46) and 37% (n = 22) of pasteurized milk samples had a high aerobic plate count (APC) (104 CFU/ml) and coliform count (>10 CFU/ml), respectively. None of the samples was positive for Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter spp. Among 158 E. coli positive raw milk samples, 9% (n = 14) contained pathogenic E. coli, and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) were found to be the predominant pathotypes. Of the 23 pathogenic E. coli identified from 14 samples based on their gene contents, >95% (n = 22) were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 13% (n = 3) of isolates were resistant to â‰¥3 classes of antibiotics. Several factors including the time of milking, hygiene practices of the producers, cow breed and amount of milk produced by the cow were found to be significantly associated with high APC of milk samples. In conclusion, both raw and commercially pasteurized milk are highly contaminated with fecal organisms. For intervention, more emphasis should be given at producer's level as microorganisms introduced to milk at this stage get the longest time for survival and multiplication."
"Sustainable Carbons and Fuels: Recent Advances of CO2 Conversion in Molten Salts Electrode; Molten Materials; Electrolysis The massive release of the greenhouse gas CO2 has resulted in numerous environmental issues. In searching for advanced technologies for CO2 capture/conversions, recent advances in electrochemical reduction of CO2 in molten salts shed a light on potential solutions to CO2 mitigation. Electro-reduction of CO2 in molten salts exhibits features like high selectivity and efficiency towards sustainable carbons and fuels, low toxicity, and possibility to combine with in situ CO2 capture. In this Minireview, we highlight the tuning of the products in this process and mainly discuss two categories of electrolyte, carbonate-based molten salts (CMS) and those based on halides (HMS). Depending on the synthetic conditions, fuels such as CO or hydrocarbons (in the presence of hydrogen source, i. e., LiOH, NaOH, or KOH in the electrolyte) as well as high-value nanostructured carbons including carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, carbon nano-onions, and graphene can be obtained with high efficiency. The synthesis parameters are compared, and the applications of as-obtained carbons are briefly summarized. Additionally, some perspectives on this technology are also discussed."
"Decoupling anthropogenic vs. natural impacts at a wastewater treatment plant situated on acid sulfate soils Acid Sulfate Soil; Wetlands; Acid Volatile Sulfides Decoupling natural and anthropogenic impacts on the subsurface environment can be difficult, particularly when it has been subject to a wide range of influences over time and space. In this work we show how the use of hydrogeochemical plotting tools, time-series analysis of key contaminants of concern, and targeted isotopic analysis can be used to better understand the contamination sources/processes in a complex environment â€“ a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) located on coastal acid sulfate soils (ASS). Analysis of soil profiles for potential oxidisable sulfur, acid neutralising capacity (ANC), and pHfox along with groundwater chemistry, revealed that oxidation of pyritic sediments, initially deposited during the mid-Holocene, have led to significant pH declines and the secondary mobilisation of metals into the groundwater environment. This is further complicated by historic anthropogenic inputs associated with the WWTP (e.g., effluent leakages) and the surrounding agricultural land uses. There is distinct separation between spatial and temporal trends in the nutrient and heavy metals data in groundwater, suggesting these reflect different contaminant sources and/or processes. Isotopic data indicate nutrients are largely derived from the WWTP, whereas time-series analysis of key contaminants of concern and hydrogeochemical plotting tools indicate metals are largely derived from the secondary mobilisation of ASS due to acidity generated during sulfide oxidation. This work highlights the importance of understanding the hydrogeological environment and need for careful planning and ongoing management of WWTP sites, particularly those constructed on potential acid sulfate soils (PASS), which, if disturbed or exposed, can lead to impacts beyond the area of ASS via groundwater discharge to nearby surface water bodies (in this case the site is adjacent to a Ramsar-listed wetland). The outcomes of this work have significant global application in the identification, assessment, and control of ASS, the practice of contaminant source attribution, and the siting and design of future WWTPs, which will continue to be sited in coastal areas to meet population needs."
"Towards computer vision and deep learning facilitated pollination monitoring for agriculture Bombus; Bees; Neonicotinoids Globally, pollinators affect 35% of agricultural land and play a key role in food production. Consequently, monitoring is useful to understand the contribution insects make towards crop pollination. Traditional sampling techniques used in insect monitoring have several drawbacks, including that they are labour intensive and potentially unreliable. Some of these drawbacks may be overcome using computer vision and deep learning-based approaches to automate pollination monitoring. In this paper, we present a pipeline for computer vision-based pollination monitoring and propose a novel algorithm, Polytrack, that tracks multiple insects simultaneously in complex agricultural environments. Our algorithm uses deep learning and fore-ground/background segmentation to detect and track in-sects. We achieved precision and recall rates of 0.975 and 0.972 respectively when monitoring honeybees foraging in our test sites within the polytunnels of an industrial straw-berry farm. Polytrack includes a flower identification module to automate collection of insect-flower interaction data, and a low-resolution processing mode that reduces computational demands placed on the processor to bring the software towards the requirements of low-powered monitoring hardware."
"State of Charge Estimation for Electric Vehicle Battery Using Fuzzy Sliding Mode Observer Battery Management Systems; Battery Pack; Charging (Batteries) In recent years, the development and utilization of Lithium-ion batteries have further promoted the development of electric vehicle and related battery management systems. Estimating the battery state of charge (SoC) is essential for battery management systems. Most studies on SoC estimation have focused on model-based observer designing. The sliding mode control strategy is suitable for estimating the battery SoC due to its strong robustness, insensitivity to parameter perturbation and external disturbance, and high estimation accuracy. This paper aims to design a battery SoC estimator using the proposed fuzzy sliding mode control strategy. The fuzzy control logic is introduced to suppress chattering by regulating the switching gain in the sliding mode control law. Firstly, the second-order Thevenin equivalent circuit model of the battery is established. Then a fuzzy sliding mode observer is designed based on the equivalent circuit model to estimate the battery's SoC. Finally, the designed observer is simulated and verified."
"Synchrotron X-Ray Radiation-Induced Bystander Effect: An Impact of the Scattered Radiation, Distance From the Irradiated Site and p53 Cell Status Bystander Effect; Microbeams; Low Drug Dose Synchrotron radiation, especially microbeam radiotherapy (MRT), has a great potential to improve cancer radiotherapy, but non-targeted effects of synchrotron radiation have not yet been sufficiently explored. We have previously demonstrated that scattered synchrotron radiation induces measurable Î³-H2AX foci, a biomarker of DNA double-strand breaks, at biologically relevant distances from the irradiated field that could contribute to the apparent accumulation of bystander DNA damage detected in cells and tissues outside of the irradiated area. Here, we quantified an impact of scattered radiation to DNA damage response in â€œnaÃ¯veâ€ cells sharing the medium with the cells that were exposed to synchrotron radiation. To understand the effect of genetic alterations in naÃ¯ve cells, we utilised p53-null and p53-wild-type human colon cancer cells HCT116. The cells were grown in two-well chamber slides, with only one of nine zones (of equal area) of one well irradiated with broad beam or MRT. Î³-H2AX foci per cell values induced by scattered radiation in selected zones of the unirradiated well were compared to the commensurate values from selected zones in the irradiated well, with matching distances from the irradiated zone. Scattered radiation highly impacted the DNA damage response in both wells and a pronounced distance-independent bystander DNA damage was generated by broad-beam irradiations, while MRT-generated bystander response was negligible. For p53-null cells, a trend for a reduced response to scattered irradiation was observed, but not to bystander signalling. These results will be taken into account for the assessment of genotoxic effects in surrounding non-targeted tissues in preclinical experiments designed to optimise conditions for clinical MRT and for cancer treatment in patients."
"Determining Trendelenburg test validity and reliability using 3-dimensional motion analysis and muscle dynamometry Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome; Quadriceps Femoris Muscle; Biomechanics Background: The hip abductor muscle group stabilises the pelvis during gait to prevent excessive pelvic drop. Hip abductor weakness has been linked to musculoskeletal conditions such as chronic low-back pain. As such, it is important that practitioners can correctly diagnose hip abductor weakness in a clinical setting. Although the Trendelenburg test is commonly used by practitioners, the validity of this test to assess hip abductor weakness in the absence of musculoskeletal injury remains questionable. The aim of this study was to determine the validity of the Trendelenburg test, as observed by a practitioner, to assess frontal plane pelvic motion and hip abductor strength in a population without intra-articular hip disorders. Methods: This study was performed between June 14th and October 16th 2019. Eighteen participants were recruited for this study. Peak normalised isometric and isokinetic hip abductor torque were measured bilaterally (n = 36) using the Biodex System 4 isokinetic dynamometer. Each participant performed the Trendelenburg test bilaterally (n = 36) while a graduate year chiropractic practitioner assessed for a â€œpositiveâ€ or â€œnegativeâ€ sign. The test was simultaneously recorded using Vicon 3-Dimensional motion capture to measure frontal plane pelvic motion and elevation. Correlation analyses were performed between the measures of peak hip abductor torque and pelvic motion to determine if any relationship existed. Agreement between the practitioner and 3-Dimensional analysis was calculated using the kappa (Îº) statistic. Results: Weak, non-significant correlations were found between hip abductor strength and pelvic motion before outlier removal. Significant (p < 0.05) yet weak correlations were found after outlier removal, except for isometric hip abductor strength. Weak agreement was found between the chiropractic practitioner and 3-Dimesnional analysis for the Trendelenburg test assessment (Îº = 0.22â€“0.25). Conclusions: This study found no significant relationship between normalised peak isometric and isokinetic hip abductor torque and frontal plane pelvic motion during the Trendelenburg test in a healthy young adult population. There was also poor agreement between the practitioner and pelvic motion assessments. Caution should be used when using this test, in the absence of intra-articular hip pathology, to assesses hip abductor weakness. Before any definitive conclusion can be made, studies with a larger sample size should be performed."

"A novel upconversion optical thermometers derived from non-thermal coupling levels of CaZnOS:Tm/Yb phosphors Upconversion; Luminescence; Phosphors The growing interest in precise, rapid and contactless optical temperature sensor has led to the more demand for novel materials. In this work, Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doped CaZnOS phosphors were synthesized via a simple method of precipitation. The upconversion luminescence (UC) properties and optical temperature behavior were investigated. The strongest UC intensity was achieved with the doping concentration of 1:9 (Tm:Yb) and the emission bands located at 483 â€‹nm, 652 â€‹nm and 792 â€‹nm were ascribed to 1G4â†’3H6, 1G4â†’3F4 and 3H4â†’3H6 transitions, respectively. The optical thermometry using fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) based on non-thermal coupling levels (NTCLs, 1G4 and 3H4) was employed to assess temperature sensing performance through analyzing temperature-dependent UC spectra of CaZnOS: Tm/Yb (1:9) sample. The maximum sensing sensitivity was 0.0262 â€‹Kâˆ’1 â€‹at 393 â€‹K, as a comparation, which is more than 20 times higher than that of thermal coupling levels (TCLs, 1G4(a), and 1G4(b)). The result shows the validity of optical thermometry based on NTCLs, simultaneously suggesting that CaZnOS has great potential in temperature sensors."
Sentiment and stock market connectedness: Evidence from the U.S. – China trade war Investor Sentiment; Exchange Traded Funds; Stock Market We assess the impact of monthly and daily investor sentiment on stock market return and volatility connectedness during the U.S.-China trade war period. Our analyses focus on the connectedness between the two economies and their major trading partners. We also investigate the asymmetric impact of sentiment on volatility connectedness by exploring the upside and downside markets separately. We consistently document a negative relationship between investor sentiment and stock market connectedness for both return and volatility. We further confirm that investor sentiment exerts a larger impact on volatility connectedness in the downside market compared to the upside market.
"We have a steak in it: Eliciting interventions to reduce beef consumption and its impact on biodiversity Meat Consumption; Diet; Livestock Products Beef production is a major driver of biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions globally, and multiple studies recommend reducing beef production and consumption. Although there have been significant efforts from the biodiversity conservation sector toward reducing beef-production impacts, there has been comparatively much less engagement in reducing beef consumption. As a first step to address this gap and identify leverage points, we conducted a policy Delphi expert elicitation. We asked 16 multidisciplinary experts from research and practitioner backgrounds to propose interventions for reducing beef consumption in the United States. Experts generated and critiqued 20 interventions, creating a qualitative dataset that was thematically analyzed to allow the interventions to be prioritized. Effective, feasible interventions included changing perceived social norms, targeting food providers, and increasing the availability and quality of beef alternatives. This work introduces a conservation research agenda for reducing beef consumption and explores a structured process for prioritizing behavioral interventions."
"Influence of carbon pricing on regional aircraft and route network design System of Systems; Systems Engineering; Software Architecture Carbon pricing policies have become the de-facto standard policy of national and multinational governments in an attempt to mitigate the affects of green house gasses on the environment. To date carbon pricing, either in the form of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme, has been implemented by more than 60 countries. Regional aircraft network operations will be challenged by the effect of carbon pricing policies as they increase the fuel price on domestic air travel. A System of Systems analysis is performed to determine the effect of carbon pricing on a regional airline network. This analysis includes route and passenger allocations while considering different combinations of a narrow body jet transport and turboprop aircraft. Trade-offs in network operation were analyzed using different turboprop configurations under three different carbon pricing scenarios for a representative regional network using data from Qantas Airways operating in Australia. While the carbon pricing policies increase the fuel price by up to 72%, results show that optimal allocation of airline resources in the network increase the operational cost and passenger ticket price only by up to 5.81%. This is achieved by changing the fleet compositions by up to 34%. Optimal route network configurations favored smaller but more efficient turboprops over higher capacity turboprops to improve payload range efficiency and reduce fuel burn."
"Evaluating the regional social sustainability contribution of public-private partnerships in China: The development of an indicator system China; Build-Operate-Transfer; Risk Allocations Publicâ€“private partnerships (PPPs) have been increasingly adopted in China. Sustainability of PPPs has become a priority for a sustainable development of PPPs. Most prior studies focus on sustainable implementation of PPP projects. Few research efforts have been done to examine the impacts of PPPs to sustainability from an external perspective and a more macro geographical scale. Meanwhile, the social aspect of the sustainability of PPPs has not been widely studied. Therefore, this study aims to propose a social sustainability contribution evaluation system (SSCES) for PPPs to evaluate PPPs' contribution to regional social sustainability at the institutional level. An indicator system of the SSCES for PPPs was developed, which included 8 requirements for socially sustainable development and 33 social sustainability indicators. The weights of indicators were determined by using the analytic hierarchy process method. The results indicate that, in the context of China, promoting people-oriented urbanization in PPPs can help enhance regional social sustainability. This study provides a useful evaluation tool for various stakeholders to evaluate the sustainability of PPPs from an institutional level, especially for local governments to review current PPP polices and make improvements."
"Evolving project based learning to suit diverse student cohorts Software; Software Process; Project-Based Learning Software engineering courses are increasingly moving towards a project-based learning (PBL) approach. PBL allows abstract software engineering principles and practices to be learnt experientially making the course more appealing to diverse student cohorts. Employers favor PBL as students get exposed to current industry practices, processes and tools, thus narrowing the industry-academia gap. PBL however, poses a number of challenges. Academic staff need to find efficient ways of managing many additional tasks related to PBL such as getting licenses, developing technical materials, managing projects and handling team issues. Students involved in PBL need to be exposed to teamwork and project management skills concurrently. In this paper we present our experience evolving a hybrid-teaching model by using the action research cycle plan-act-observe-reflect over 3 semesters. The main novelty of our approach is the use of projects with varying levels of scaffolding, which made it possible for students with limited programming background to have an enjoyable and beneficial project experience. To ensure fairness, projects with high levels of scaffolding required implementation of more complex use cases to get higher grades. Student surveys reveal such an approach is effective for diverse undergraduate students."
"Community-Dwelling Older Women: The Association Between Living Alone and Use of a Home Nursing Service Long-Term Care; Very Elderly; Home Care Services Objective: To investigate the use of home nursing by community-dwelling older women to determine the nature of services required by those living alone. Design: A retrospective cohort study using routinely collected data. Setting and Participants: Women aged 55 years and older living in metropolitan Melbourne who received an episode of nursing care from a large community home-based nursing service provider between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. Methods: Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were used to examine the relationship between client- and service-related factors and use of community nursing services. The primary outcome of interest was the hours of service received in a care episode. Results: A total of 134,396 episodes of care were analyzed, in which 51,606 (38.4%) episodes involved a woman who lived alone. The median hours of care per episode to women who lived alone was almost 70% more than that for women who lived with others. Multivariable regression identified factors influencing the amount of service use: living alone status, cognitive health status, and number of required home nursing activities. After adjusting for confounding and interactions, living alone was associated with at least 13% more hours of care than is provided to those not living alone. Compared with women who lived with others, women living alone required almost double the amount of assistance with medication management and were 30% more likely to experience a deterioration in their condition or be discharged from home nursing care into an acute hospital. From 2006 to 2015, for all women there was a trend toward fewer hours of nursing service provided per episode. Conclusions and Implications: Community-dwelling older women who live alone have greater service needs and higher rates of discharge to hospital. This knowledge will help guide provision of services and strategies to prevent clinical deterioration for this population."
"How Specific Is Site-Specific? A Review and Guidance for Selecting and Evaluating Approaches for Deriving Local Water Quality Benchmarks Ceriodaphnia Dubia; Daphnia Magna; Metals Existing prescriptive guidance on the derivation of local water quality benchmarks (WQBs; e.g., guideline values, criteria, standards) for protecting aquatic ecosystems is limited to only 3 to 4 specific approaches. These approaches do not represent the full suite available for deriving local WQBs for multiple types of water qualityâ€“related issues. The general lack of guidance is inconsistent with the need for, and benefits of, local WQBs, and can constrain the appropriate selection and subsequent evaluation of derivation approaches. Consequently, the defensibility of local WQBs may not be commensurate with the nature of the issues for which they are derived. Moreover, where local WQBs are incorporated into regulatory requirements, the lack of guidance presents a potential risk to the derivation of appropriate WQBs and the achievement of desired environmental outcomes. This review addresses the deficiency in guidance by 1) defining local WQBs and outlining initial considerations for deciding if one is required; 2) summarizing the existing regulatory context; 3) summarizing existing guidance and identifying gaps; 4) describing strengths, weaknesses, and potential applications of a range of derivation approaches based on laboratory and/or field data; and 5) presenting a conceptual framework for appropriately selecting and evaluating a derivation approach to best suit the need. The guidance incorporates an existing set of guiding principles for deriving local WQBs and reinforces an existing categorization of site-adapted and site-specific WQBs. The conceptual framework recognizes the need to strike an appropriate balance between effort and ecological risk and, thus, embeds the concept of fit-for-purpose by considering both the significance of the issue being assessed and the extent to which the approach provides confidence that the ecosystem will be appropriately protected. The guidance can be used by industry, regulators, and others for both the a priori selection and the post hoc evaluation of appropriate approaches for deriving local WQBs.

"Backlighting the European Indium Recycling Potentials Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals With increased understanding of the effects of human activities on the environment and added awareness of the increasing societal value of natural resources, researchers have begun to focus on the characterization of elemental cycles. Indium has captured significant attention due to the potential for supply shortages and nonexistent recycling at end of life. Such a combination of potentially critical features is magnified for countries that depend on imports of indium, notably many European countries. With the aims of analyzing the dynamics of material flows and of estimating the magnitude of secondary indium sources available for recycling, the anthropogenic indium cycle in Europe has been investigated by material flow analysis. The results showed that the region is a major consumer of finished goods containing indium, and the cumulative addition of indium in urban mines was estimated at about 500 tonnes of indium. We discuss these results from the perspective of closing the metal cycle in the region. Securing access to critical raw materials is a priority for Europe, but the preference for recycling metal urban mines risks to remain only theoretical for indium unless innovations in waste collection and processing unlock the development of technologies that are economically feasible and environmentally sustainable."
"A dyadic perspective of socially responsible mechanisms for retailer-manufacturer relationship in an apparel industry Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify and prioritise social responsible mechanisms in apparel supply chains to extend social responsibility from large retailers in developed countries to producers in developing nations. Design/methodology/approach: A framework that consists of supplier qualification and supplier relational mechanisms as two socially responsible mechanisms, with five factors and 18 dimensions is proposed. To prioritise the dimensions, analytic hierarchy process is employed by using a case study methodology of a major Australian retailer sourcing from Bangladesh manufacturers. Findings: Results indicate that at the mechanism level, both retailer and manufacturers perceive qualification of manufacturer as by far the most critical element compared to the relational mechanism. However, substantial differences exist at the factor level; namely, that the social factor is critical for the retailer, whereas the economic factor is critical for the manufacturer. Within the relational mechanism, evaluation helps retailers to enforce social responsibility, while manufacturers believe collaboration helps. Research limitations/implications: The major limitation of this study is the generalisation of the findings. The results obtained by focusing on a particular context in the Australian retail sector importing from Bangladesh, may not be applicable to other nations. Practical implications: By highlighting the difference of opinion, this study assists managers in developing guidelines to better understand the socially responsible mechanisms in the retailer-manufacturer dyadic relationship and to propose strategies to address the differences. Originality/value: This study advances the literature on inter-organisational relationship to retailer-manufacturer dyad for the implementation of social responsibility by including supplier qualification along with supplier relational mechanism."
"Uptake, depuration and sublethal effects of the neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, exposure in Sydney rock oysters Neonicotinoids; Imidacloprid; Nicotinic Receptors The broad utilisation of imidacloprid (IMI)in agriculture poses an increasing risk to aquatic organisms. However, the potential impacts on commercially important shellfish and chemical residues after exposure, are yet to be assessed. We investigated the levels of IMI in Sydney rock oyster (SRO)tissue during a three-day uptake and four-day depuration cycle using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. IMI was absorbed from the water, with significantly higher concentrations in the adductor muscles than the gills and digestive glands. Depuration was also fast with a significant drop in tissue concentrations after one day in clean water and complete elimination from all tissues except the digestive gland after four days. The distribution of IMI in SRO after direct exposure using mass spectrometry imaging demonstrated uptake and spatially resolved metabolism to hydroxyl-IMI in the digestive gland and IMI-olefin in the gills. We assessed the effects of IMI on filtration rate (FR), acetylcholinesterase (AChE)activity in the gills, and gene expression profiles in the digestive gland using transcriptomics. Exposure to 2 mg/L IMI reduced the FR of oysters on the first day, while exposure to 0.5 and 1 mg/L reduced FR on day four. IMI reduced the gill AChE activity and altered the digestive gland gene expression profile. This study indicates that commercially farmed SRO can uptake IMI from the water, but negative impacts were only detected at concentrations higher than currently detected in estuarine environments and the chemical residues can be effectively eliminated using simple depuration in clean water."
"Human–elephant conflict and land cover change in Sri Lanka Conservation Areas; Elephants; Crop Damage Humanâ€“elephant conflict (HEC) is a key environmental issue in number of Asian countries, including Sri Lanka. Incidents of HEC have significantly increased in Sri Lanka between 1991 and 2018, with 1734 human deaths reported in this period (281% increase), 4837 elephant deaths (1172% increase), 1053 human injuries (140% increase) and more than 23,000 property damage reports (1406% increase). In this study we present a Sri Lanka wide analysis to explore the role of land use and land cover change (LULCC) in relation to HEC, using official government data and a land cover change dataset (1993â€“2018) recently developed by the authors using satellite imagery from the Landsat archive. We investigated rates of HEC over time and compared these to rates of LULCC over the same period. We also present spatial analytics of HEC and LULCC, as well as determining hotspots of HEC and LULCC using a kernel density estimator. Annual HEC incidents were found to broadly increase in line with land use change events (r = 0.43, p < 0.05). Human deaths, elephant deaths, human injuries and property damage hotspots show distinct spatial patterns: human deaths and injuries being more concentrated in the North West, Polonnaruwa and Ampara, wildlife regions; while elephant deaths are spread throughout the HEC region and property damage is high in the Central, Polonnaruwa Anuradhapura, North West, and Southern wildlife regions. We found a strong negative correlation between HEC location and distance to LULCC events. In total, 98% HEC occurred within 1 km of an area that experienced recent LULCC Since 2017, the primary HEC hotspots have shifted to the south and east of the country in concert with LULCC. These countrywide perspectives could help inform HEC mitigation strategies in Sri Lanka and other countries facing similar human-wildlife challenges."
"Environmental impact of discarded apparel landfilling and recycling Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing Globally, around 87% of discarded textiles ended up in landfill, of which more than 90% are reusable and recyclable. Recycling textile waste to other value-added products is economically feasible. To integrate recycling into the apparel waste stream, it is important to know the environmental benefit and impact of the different recycling options. This study presents the environmental performance of apparel recycling and landfill using the life cycle assessment methodology in terms of climate change, acidification, agricultural land occupation and water depletion. Landfill scenarios and recycling scenarios of post-consumer household discarded apparel waste have been developed in the context of Australia. This study finds that the landfill process of natural apparel waste contributes more environmental impact credit compared to synthetic apparel, and this is mainly credited from the power generation from landfill methane gas captured. This study also specifies that the environmental benefit from the landfill process of discarded apparel depends on the ratio of natural fibre and synthetic fibre in discarded apparel. Integration of recycling into the apparel waste stream can potentially generate environmental benefits. A recycling scenario of cleaning wipes shows the highest impact benefits, followed by cotton fibre, insulation material and polyester raw material recycling. Net impact savings of recycling depend on the avoided landfill impact and avoided virgin production impact. The results generated from this study can be useful for future policy recommendations on apparel waste management through recycling. It is clear that increased collection of apparel by recyclers can significantly reduce environmental impact."
"World city futures: The role of urban and regional policies in the Asia Pacific region Hukou; China; Land Development This chapter addresses six major policy issues that confront planners concerned with placing their cities in the top rank of the world hierarchy: spatial organization, regional governance, social and environmental sustainability, migrant workers, the rise of civil society, and intercity networks. It reviews the geography of global capitalism, because the â€˜regional levelâ€™ to which A. J. Scott refers is precisely the level of world city formation. The chief sources of demographic growth for the mega-city regions come from rural migration and international migration, though Asian world cities are beginning to experience international migration as well. Rural households in world city regions are tightly integrated with an urban economy that is grounded in manufacturing and business services. The hyper-urbanizing cities of Asia are thus drawing on the so-called surplus population of rural and small town areas within their own country, although migrant workers are beginning to arrive in larger numbers also from abroad."
"Does corporate social responsibility mediate the relation between boardroom gender diversity and firm performance of Chinese listed companies? Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence Although the relationship between board gender diversity and a firm's financial performance has been investigated before, the current study provides a valuable contribution by exploring the complex phenomenon of the mediating impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance on a firm's financial performance. The current study aims to explore whether corporate social responsibility (represented by the proxy variable of CSR reporting) mediates the relationship between boardroom gender diversity and firm performance. We use the pooled ordinary least square (OLS) regression to examine the above relationship by using data from 2008 to 2015. To control the likelihood of endogeneity we also use one-year lagged and two-stage least square (2SLS) regression models. Our results show that boardroom gender diversity is significant, positively correlated with firm performance, and CSR fully mediates the relationship between boardroom gender diversity and firm performance. In addition, four control variables (independent director, Chief executive officer (CEO power), board member meeting frequency, Big4, and leverage) have some influence on firm performance. These findings hold for a set of robustness tests. Our findings have the implication for the investors and regulators. For investors, our results show that the existence of female directors on the board can improve the firm performance. For regulators, our results advise the worldwide policy maker to give the importance to boardroom gender diversity. The paper contributes to the existing studies, by pioneering the investigations of the mediating role of CSR in the relation between boardroom gender diversity and firm performance in Chinese context."
"Contextual factors of entrepreneurship intention in manufacturing SMEs: the case study of Iran Entrepreneurial Orientation; Corporate Entrepreneurship; Small And Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to establish the contextual factors that influence entrepreneurial intention to start the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Iran and to investigate why some manufacturing sector entrepreneurs achieve growth objectives while others do not. Design/methodology/approach: In-depth semistructured interviews of 25 participants were used to investigate the contextual factors of entrepreneurship intention. On the basis of the data collected, a thematic content analysis has been carried out. Findings: A set of contextual and cultural factors has been highlighted by the analysis. Data analysis led to the extraction of three main themes: external, internal and personal factors that were found to be significant determinants of entrepreneurship intention. In relation to the effect of these factors on their entrepreneurial behaviors, it emerged that there were the major barriers to entrepreneurial intentions including lack of resources, financial challenges and economic situation, which affected how they made strategic decisions about their plans. Moreover, the findings show that the key dimensions of organizational structure, public policies, social media, education and soft skills development are vital features and being influential in entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications: The study has industry-specific, size-specific and region-specific limitations. The qualitative research approach affects the generalizable character of the results. Practical implications: The research findings have important implications for practicing entrepreneurs, start-ups and policymakers. The manuscript suggests a transition to a more collaborative approach from experts and practitioners in the field through policymakers to tackling the underlying determinants of entrepreneurship intention in Iran as a motive to economic growth. This research is significant since its findings should help regulators and investors better understand the opportunities and threats among manufacturing SMEs. This study implies a step forward in research into the entrepreneurship intention and SMEs literature, since the results differ from the evidence found for large companies in developing countries such as Iran. There is also a great contribution toward the debate regarding the need to consider the context and the type of firm in enterprise development studies. Originality/value: This is the first empirical study conducted in Iran that explores three key elements of entrepreneurship intention interactively in Iran through qualitative research analysis. The research study fills a literature gap on the determinants of manufacturing SMEsâ€™ functions. This manuscript explores the contextual factors that influence on entrepreneurial behavior in a conflict country context, using a thematic analysis for in-depth results. A new approach to evaluating entrepreneurial opportunities was used. The advantage of this empirical strategy is that it takes into account in more detail the content observations and experiences with the industry-specific insights. It also gives more description about the contingent nature of practice. Moreover, this qualitative research acknowledged the areas of conflict and contradiction around entrepreneurship phenomena among SMEs."

"Discussion forums: A misnomer? Examining lurkers, engagement and academic achievement Distance Education; Social Presence; Online Discussion Discussion forums are often touted as maximising student participation and learning but concerns around engagement counter any perceived benefits. Often participation is the measure of engagement, and students who do not post are deemed unengaged. To further examine engagement and forums as learning communities, we used analytic data from 270 students enrolled in two online psychology subjects using social network analysis and interviewed 22 students. Both subjectsâ€™ forums had greater egalitarian triads, indicative of reciprocal relationships. Furthermore, both active posters and lurkers had a mix of grade bands indicating that some lurkers still achieved academically. Lurking was a key qualitative theme along with checking for assessment information and intimidation. For both subjects, students were engaged with the forums, and differences in connectivity were consistent with the different subject content. However, forum activity indicated that these forums were more like subscription services than communities of practice. We propose that forums can be transformed into dynamic teaching spaces through understanding the multidimensionality of engagement, setting the expectation and tone of the forum as a safe place, and enhancing the platforms so visible indicators show that posts have been read or consumed. We further propose that students who engage but do not post be called quiet participants. Implications for practice or policy: â€¢ Educators and researchers can improve the understanding of engagement with discussion forums by acknowledging the distinction between participation and engagement. â€¢ Online providers can assist in transforming these online platforms into dynamic teaching tools through enhancements that indicate a post has been read. â€¢ Educators can increase engagement by setting the tone and expectations for the forum. â€¢ Replacing the negative term lurker with quiet participants better reflects the activity of these students."
"A conceptual framework for the adoption of e-government in Indonesia Open Government; Transparency; E-Governance The rapid development of e-government across the world has opened the discussion on how governments can improve citizensâ€™ adoption of their online public services. As a result, the adoption of e-government has become a fundamental issue that needs to be adequately addressed. This paper presents a conceptual framework for examining the adoption of e-government from the perspective of citizens. Through semi-structured interviews conducted in Indonesia, the conceptual framework was validated using thematic analysis, which indicates that performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence are interrelated critical factors for the adoption of e-government. In terms of academic contribution, this research provides a better understanding of the critical factors for the adoption of e-government from the perspective of citizens. With regards to practical implications, this research provides the Indonesian government and public organisations with relevant suggestions on how the adoption of e-government can be improved."
"Temporary and Tactical Urbanism in Australia: Perspectives from Practice Graffiti; Street Art; Banksy â€œTemporaryâ€ and â€œtacticalâ€ (T/T) urbanism is argued to herald a more agile future for urban design and planning, enhancing urban intensity, community engagement, innovation, resilience and local identity. Drawing on interviews with expert practitioners, this paper explores the distinctive character of Australian â€œT/Tâ€ urbanism approaches. It examines their diverse, dynamic assemblages of actors and interests, and their links to neoliberal deregulation, austerity, gentrification, and to long-term state planning and investment. While Australian T/T urbanism follows overseas precedents, it is seen less as aâ€œDIYâ€ or â€œguerrillaâ€ response to neoliberal regimes, and more focussed on enhancing citizen engagement and collaboration within planning."
"An investigation of shippers’ satisfaction and behaviour towards corporate social responsibility in maritime transport Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy Anchoring on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), the current paper investigates the moderating influences of shippersâ€™ corporate social responsibility (CSR) beliefs on their satisfaction and behaviour towards shipping firmsâ€™ involvement in CSR. It also analyses organisational and environmental factors that shape shippersâ€™ CSR beliefs. Survey data were obtained from 276 shippers with business offices located in Singapore, and analysed using multi-sampling approach and linear regression modelling. The results show that shippers with strong CSR beliefs derive greater satisfaction, and exhibit stronger behavioural intentions towards shipping firmsâ€™ involvement in CSR. In addition, shippersâ€™ CSR beliefs are influenced by shippersâ€™ organisational characteristics such as (1) firm's age, (2) firm's size, (3) degree of internationalisation, (4) types of products shipped, and environmental factors such as (5) perceived environmental and social threats, (6) perceived level of competition, and (7) level of CSR practices in headquarters. The results contribute to TPB research application in both B2C and B2B contexts, and motivate changes to the current marketing and communication practices of shipping firms."
"Tour recommendation and trip planning using location-based social media: a survey Human Mobility; Taxis; Points Of Interest Tourism is both an important industry and popular leisure activity undertaken by millions around the world. One important task for tourists is to plan and schedule tour itineraries that comprise multiple captivating Points-of-Interests based on the unique interest preferences of the tourist. The complex task of tour itinerary recommendation is further complicated by the need to incorporate various real-life constraints such as limited time for touring, uncertain traffic conditions, inclement weather, group travel, queuing times and crowdedness. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of studies on tour itinerary recommendation and present a general taxonomy for touring-related research. We discuss the entire process of tour itinerary recommendation research including: (i) data collection and types of datasets; (ii) problem formulations and proposed algorithms/systems for individual travellers, groups of tourists and various real-life considerations; (iii) evaluation methodologies for comparing tour itinerary recommendation algorithms; and (iv) future directions and open problems in tour itinerary recommendation research."
"Does daily commuting behavior matter to employee productivity? Commute; Bicycling; Travel This study is the first of its kind to explore the relationship between commuting behavior and employee productivity by drawing theories from multiple disciplines and providing empirical evidence from Australian cities. Relying on survey data collected from three major cities in Australia, this study finds that commuting distance is positively associated with absenteeism. This study also finds a positive association between active commuting (i.e., travel to work by walking or bicycling) and job performance in the middle-aged employees. The structural equation model further explored possible causal pathways from commuting to employee productivity, and the results reveal that commuting mode choices and commuting distance influence absenteeism and job performance through affecting commuting satisfaction and personal health, though commuting distance retains a direct impact on absenteeism after controlling for the indirect effects. In particular, the results suggest that the happy commuters are more productive, and the short-distance and active travel commuters are more likely to be the happy commuters. Overall, these findings support that commuting behaviors of employees influence their productivity at the workplace. Encourage active commuting not only improves the physical health of employees, but may also enhance their job performance, contributing to the economic benefits to employers and society."
"Prediction of the driver's head acceleration and vibration isolation performance of the seating suspension system using the time and frequency domain modeling Active Suspension Systems; Automobile; Magnetorheological Damper Long-time exposure to low-frequency vibration will negatively impact human health. A rapid biodynamic system modeling method has been proposed to study the human body's response to the low-frequency vibration excitation in the whole vehicle environment. The sensitivity of design parameters of the seating suspension system to the vibration isolation performance will be studied. The dynamic model consists of a lumped parameter mass-spring-dashpot model of seven degrees of freedom (7DOF) and used for the prediction of the head acceleration in the time domain and peak transmissibility ratio in the frequency domain under a sinusoidal wave excitation and random road profile excitations of different road classes and vehicle speeds. A calculation formula has been established to predict the seat effective amplitude transmissibility (SEAT) from the transmissibility ratios and frequency weighting function of the ISO 8606, while the transmissibility ratios can be calculated from the frequency response analysis of the seven degrees of freedom system dynamic equations. The simulation results in the frequency domain have been verified by those in the time domain for the linear system assumption. The change trends of the driver's head acceleration, SEAT value, and peak transmissibility ratio from the driver's head to the seat base with respect to the stiffness and damping coefficients of the seat and cushion have been compared with and verified by one another. It is proved that in the vehicle system, individually, reducing the individual stiffness and damping coefficients of the seat structure, reducing the individual seat cushion stiffness, and increasing the individual seat cushion damping coefficient one by one will be able to reduce the driver's head acceleration, peak transmissibility ratio, and SEAT value from the head to seat base, and improve the ride comfort. Simultaneously reducing the stiffness and damping coefficients of the seat and cushion will be able to reduce the driver's head acceleration, peak transmissibility ratio, and SEAT value from the head to seat base and improve the ride comfort. The reduction effect of the driver's head acceleration is more substantial under the Class E road profile of a large profile roughness than that under the other road classes."

The potential for reducing environmental impacts while creating sustainable agriculture and food production from the perspective of technological applications by SMEs is discussed with broader environmental impact considerations."
"Confined Synthesis: From Layered Titanate to Highly Efficient and Durable Mesoporous Cu/TiO2Hydrogen Evolution Photocatalysts Hydrogen Production; Photocatalysts; Titanium Dioxide Highly efficient, durable, and earth-Abundant photocatalysts are of great interest toward practical photocatalytic conversion reactions, such as hydrogen generation and CO2 reduction. In this work, the intercalation and confinement of ""copper ions""within layered titanate nanosheets enabled preparation of copper-modified TiO2 mesoporous spheres (Cu/TiO2), which contain well-dispersed small copper nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 3-5 nm over the TiO2 mesoporous spheres. Without a cocatalyst (e.g., Pt), the obtained samples exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity (13.45 mmol/g/h) and excellent durability during a cyclic HER testing for 120 h, compared against 2.41 mmol/g/h of Cu-modified P25 TiO2. Computational simulations suggest that the Fermi level of small copper nanoparticles is located between the conduction band of TiO2 and the H+/H2 reduction potential, and if extrapolated to nanoparticles, then this holds for particles up to approximately 9 nm. This would efficiently facilitate electron trapping and then transfer from TiO2 to copper followed by the reduction reaction, leading to excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction."
"Decolorization and detoxification of textile dyes using a versatile Streptomyces laccase-natural mediator system Laccase; Coloring Agent; Trametes Versicolor Currently, there is increasing interest in assessing the potential of bacterial laccases for industrial and environmental applications especially in harsh conditions. The environmental impact of the textile industry requires novel and effective technologies to mitigate the presence of dyes in wastewaters before discharging into the environment. Dyes usually remain stable in the presence of a variety of chemicals, light and are recalcitrant to microbial degradation. Among available technologies the biological treatments offer environmentally friendly strategies for decolorizing and detoxifying these compounds. The recent discovery of versatile laccases in streptomycetes opens up new opportunities for their commercial application. The aim of this study is to assess the potential of a novel bacterial laccase SilA produced by Streptomyces ipomoeae CECT 3341 active over wide temperature and pH ranges for use as an eco-friendly, biological treatment for the degradation of textile dyes. Insights into the enhancement of the oxidative action of this enzyme through the use of natural redox mediators are presented together with an assessment of the potential toxicity of the degradation products. Our results confirm that the combination of the laccase and natural mediators such as acetosyringone and methyl syringate enhanced the decolorization and detoxification of a variety of textile dyes up to sixfold and 20-fold, respectively. Mediator concentration was found to have a significant effect (p < 0.05) on dye decolorization at 60 Â°C; thus, the decolorization of Acid Orange 63 increased from 6 to 70-fold when the mediator concentration was increased from 0.1 to 0.5 mM. Further, the toxicity of tartrazine decreased 36-fold when the SilA-MeS system was used to decolorize the dye. The thermal properties of the SilA coupled with the stability of SilA at high pH suggest a potential commercial application for use in the decolorization of textile wastewaters which generally are performed at high temperature (>55 Â°C) and salinity and neutral pH, conditions which are unfavourable for conventional fungal laccases."
"Additive manufacturing in radiation oncology: A review of clinical practice, emerging trends and research opportunities Applicators; Film Dosimetry; Radiotherapy The additive manufacturing (AM) process plays an important role in enabling cross-disciplinary research in engineering and personalised medicine. Commercially available clinical tools currently utilised in radiotherapy are typically based on traditional manufacturing processes, often leading to non-conformal geometries, time-consuming manufacturing process and high costs. An emerging application explores the design and development of patient-specific clinical tools using AM to optimise treatment outcomes among cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. In this review, we: â€¢ highlight the key advantages of AM in radiotherapy where rapid prototyping allows for patient-specific manufacture â€¢ explore common clinical workflows involving radiotherapy tools such as bolus, compensators, anthropomorphic phantoms, immobilisers, and brachytherapy moulds; and â€¢ investigate how current AM processes are exploited by researchers to achieve patient tissue-like imaging and dose attenuations. Finally, significant AM research opportunities in this space are highlighted for their future advancements in radiotherapy for diagnostic and clinical research applications."

We apply this framework to synthetic and real problems and demonstrate its reliability and broad applicability. The algorithms and data are available in the R package eventstream, and other code in the supplementary material."
"Wild infrastructure Degrowth; Environmental Conflict; Aciclovir At the heart of the quest for more sustainable development is the need for better recognition of the trajectory and ongoing legacy of unsustainable development. This includes the need to repoliticise the role of critical urban infrastructure and the extractive development processes which have imposed an extreme cost on communities locally and globally. Drawing on conceptualisations of wild policy and planning, and examples from within the Australian context, this article highlights insights from new paradigms of social and ecological commons for building infrastructural futures that are ecologically balanced, community-orientated and culturally sensitive. Better understanding the contested role of â€˜wildâ€™ infrastructure in societal transformations is not just recognition of vulnerability and interconnectedness, but the need for more regenerative practices that involves working with communities from the ground up."
"Fabrication of a Reusable Carbon Dot/Gold Nanoparticle/Metal-Organic Framework Film for Fluorescence Detection of Lead Ions in Water Myeloperoxidase; Colorimetric; Chromogenic Compounds Solid-state sensing platforms are desirable for the development of reusable sensors to promote public health measures such as testing for drinking water contamination. A bioinspired metal-organic framework (MOF)-based material has been developed by imitating metal-protein interactions in biological systems to attain high sensitivity and selectivity to Pb2+ through fluorescence sensing. A zirconium terephthalate-type framework (also known as NH2-UiO-66) was modified with both gold nanoparticles and thiol-functionalized carbon dots to give HS-C/Au(x)/UiO-66 composites with different Au content (x) and were subsequently adapted into films that show extraordinary sensitivity to Pb2+. The HS-C/Au(1.4)/UiO-66 film that consists of 1.4 wt % Au shows a quenching response with the limit of detection of 80 parts per trillion and sustained performance for five cycles. Moreover, the fluorescence response of the HS-C/Au(x)/UiO-66 film to Pb2+ can be reversed from emission quenching to enrichment of fluorescence by increasing the Au content. The performance of the HS-C/Au(x)/UiO-66 film as a solid-state sensor demonstrates its potential for application in reusable sensing devices to ensure public safety from Pb2+ contamination in drinking water."
"Orthogonal Charge Transfer by Precise Positioning of Silver Single Atoms and Clusters on Carbon Nitride for Efficient Piezocatalytic Pure Water Splitting Cyanogen; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Photocatalysts Developing efficient piezocatalytic systems for two-electron water splitting (TEWS) with producing H2 and H2O2 shows great promise to meet the industrial demand. Herein, Ag single atoms (SAs) and clusters are co-anchored on carbon nitride (AgSA+Câˆ’CN) to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient TEWS. The Ag SAs enhance the in-plane piezoelectric polarization of CN that is intimately modulated by the atomic coordination induced charge redistribution, and Ag clusters afford strong interfacial electric field to remarkably promote the out-of-plane migration of piezoelectrons from CN. Moreover, AgSA+Câˆ’CN yields a larger piezoresistive effect that elevates carrier mobility under strain. Consequently, a superior H2 and H2O2 evolution rate of 7.90 mmol gâˆ’1 hâˆ’1 and 5.84 mmol gâˆ’1 hâˆ’1 is delivered by AgSA+Câˆ’CN, respectively, far exceeding that of the previously reported piezocatalysts. This work not only presents the SAs decoration as an available polarization enhancement strategy, but also sheds light on the superiority of multi-sites engineering in piezocatalysis."
"Three-Dimensional Micropatterning Deters Early Bacterial Adherence and Can Eliminate Colonization Bacterial Adhesion; Patterning; Escherichia Coli Developing strategies to prevent bacterial infections that do not rely on the use of drugs is regarded globally as an important means to stem the tide of antimicrobial resistance, as argued by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Mendelson, M.; Matsoso, M. P. The World Health Organization Global Action Plan for Antimicrobial Resistance. S. Afr. Med. J. 2015, 105 (5), 325-325. DOI: 10.7196/SAMJ.9644). Given that many antimicrobial-resistant infections are caused by the bacterial colonization of indwelling medical devices such as catheters and ventilators, the use of microengineered surfaces to prevent the initial attachment of microbes to these devices is a promising solution. In this work, it is demonstrated that 3D engineered surfaces can inhibit the initial phases of surface colonization for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, representing the three most common catheter-associated urinary tract bacterial infections, identified by the WHO as urgent threats. A variety of designs including 11 different topographies and configurations that exhibited random distributions, sharp protrusions, and/or curvilinear shapes with dimensions ranging between 500 nm and 2 Î¼m were tested to better understand the initial stages of surface colonization and how to optimize the design of fabricated surfaces for improved inhibition. These topographies were fabricated in two configurations to obtain either a standard 2D cross section or a 3D engineered topography using a novel UV lithography process enabling cost-efficient high-throughput manufacturing. Evaluating both the number of adhered bacteria and microcolonies formed by all three bacterial pathogens on the different surfaces provides insight into the initial colonization phase of bacterial growth on the various surfaces. The results demonstrate that both initial attachment and subsequent colonization can be significantly reduced on concrete 3D engineered patterns when compared to flat substrates and standard 2D micropatterns. Thus, this technology has great potential to reduce the colonization of bacteria on surfaces in clinical settings without the need for chemical treatments that might enhance antimicrobial resistance."
"Delineating multiple salinization processes in a coastal plain aquifer, northern China: Hydrochemical and isotopic evidence Coastal Aquifer; Saltwater Intrusion; Groundwater Groundwater is an important water resource for agricultural irrigation and urban and industrial utilization in the coastal regions of northern China. In the past 5 decades, coastal groundwater salinization in the Yang-Dai river plain has become increasingly serious under the influence of anthropogenic activities and climatic change. It is pivotal for the scientific management of coastal water resources to accurately understand groundwater salinization processes and their causative factors. Hydrochemical (major ion and trace element) and stable isotopic (Î´;18O and Î´2H) analysis of different water bodies (surface water, groundwater, geothermal water and seawater) were conducted to improve understanding of groundwater salinization processes in the plain's Quaternary aquifer. Saltwater intrusion due to intensive groundwater pumping is a major process, either by vertical infiltration along riverbeds which convey saline surface water inland, and/or direct subsurface lateral inflow. Trends in salinity with depth indicate that the former may be more important than previously assumed. The proportion of seawater in groundwater is estimated to have reached up to 13 % in shallow groundwater of a local well field. End-member mixing calculations also indicate that the geothermal water with high total dissolved solids (up to 10.6 g L-1) with depleted stable isotope compositions and elevated strontium concentrations (10 mg L-1) also mixes locally with water in the overlying Quaternary aquifers. This is particularly evident in samples with elevated Sr â€¢ Cl ratios (0.005 mass ratio). Deterioration of groundwater quality by salinization is also clearly exacerbated by anthropogenic pollution. Nitrate contamination via intrusion of heavily polluted marine water is evident locally (e.g., in the Zaoyuan well field); however, more widespread nitrate contamination due to other local sources such as fertilizers and/or domestic wastewater is evident on the basis of NO3 â€¢ Cl ratios. This study provides an example of how multiple geochemical indicators can delineate different salinization processes and guide future water management practices in a densely populated water-stressed coastal region."
"Recent Progress on the Development of Carbon Nitride Based All-Solid Z-Scheme Photocatalyst for Solar Energy Conversion Applications Cyanogen; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Photocatalysts The visible-light responsive semiconductor carbon nitride (C3N4) exhibits suitable electronic band structure, rich sources of precursors, and high stability, which is exploited to satisfy energy demands. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of C3N4 is limited because of its low surface area and low separation and transfer efficiency of charge carriers. As Z-scheme strategy can effectively help C3N4 overcome its instinct shortage, this review will outline the recent significant progress on the development of C3N4-based all-solid Z-scheme photocatalysts for energy-conversion applications including water splitting and CO2 reduction. In the beginning, the fundamental principles of Z-scheme will be introduced, especially for all-solid-state system. Then, the comprehensive account of the development of C3N4-based Z-scheme photocatalysts are discussed. Finally, perspectives on the challenges and future directions at the forefront of Z-scheme photocatalysts are provided."
"Universities as legal entities and community dispute resolution: An Australian case study Governance; Communicative Rationality; Urban Policy This article considers the exercise of statutory power by an Australian university, in the state of Victoria, when undertaking commercial activities that impact negatively on a local community. A single case study design is used to report on the process engaged in by the community and university to resolve this dispute. This includes consideration of the universityâ€™s characterisation of the activities it engaged in, the university bypassing local planning processes and the universityâ€™s identification of the community with which to conduct its consultation processes. All publicly available documents regarding the proposed development were scrutinised as well as records of public forums related to the dispute. The study findings advance public understanding of the complexity of the vexed question of the extent to which university legislation can be used for commercial purposes and key issues for consideration when undertaking universityâ€“community engagement that have wider application for universities globally. John Deweyâ€™s philosophy of democracy and education provides valuable insights for developing democratic processes that facilitate deep understandings and good will that ultimately have the potential to enrich communities and prevent conflict."

"Counting the Costs of Public Housing Estate Redevelopment in Melbourne: A comparison of delivery options Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Since 2001, social housing levels, traditionally a safety net for low-income households, have stagnated in Victoria. To increase social housing levels, the Victorian state government announced a programme to redevelop ageing public housing estates through publicâ€“private partnerships. This study compares private sector, community housing sector, and government-led redevelopment models, to determine which provides the best value for money method of redevelopment. Importantly, considering the Victorian governmentâ€™s plans to increase social housing levels post-COVID19, the study found that the government is best placed to deliver social housing, due, in part, to lower borrowing costs and no requirement for making profit."
"A knowledge graph based approach for mobile application recommendation Collaborative Filtering; Recommender Systems; Factorization With the rapid prevalence of mobile devices and the dramatic proliferation of mobile applications (apps), app recommendation becomes an emergent task that would benefit both app users and stockholders. How to effectively organize and make full use of rich side information of users and apps is a key challenge to address the sparsity issue for traditional approaches. To meet this challenge, we proposed a novel end-to-end Knowledge Graph Convolutional Embedding Propagation Model (KGEP) for app recommendation. Specifically, we first designed a knowledge graph construction method to model the user and app side information, then adopted KG embedding techniques to capture the factual triplet-focused semantics of the side information related to the first-order structure of the KG, and finally proposed a relation-weighted convolutional embedding propagation model to capture the recommendation-focused semantics related to high-order structure of the KG. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art recommendation approaches."
"Active and passive electro-optical sensors for health assessment in food crops Stripe Rust; Plant Leaves; Puccinia Striiformis In agriculture, early detection of plant stresses is advantageous in preventing crop yield losses. Remote sensors are increasingly being utilized for crop health monitoring, offering non-de-structive, spatialized detection and the quantification of plant diseases at various levels of measure-ment. Advances in sensor technologies have promoted the development of novel techniques for precision agriculture. As in situ techniques are surpassed by multispectral imaging, refinement of hyperspectral imaging and the promising emergence of light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote sensing will define the future of biotic and abiotic plant stress detection, crop yield estimation and product quality. The added value of LIDAR-based systems stems from their greater flexibility in capturing data, high rate of data delivery and suitability for a high level of automation while overcoming the shortcomings of passive systems limited by atmospheric conditions, changes in light, viewing angle and canopy structure. In particular, a multi-sensor systems approach and associated data fusion techniques (i.e., blending LIDAR with existing electro-optical sensors) offer increased accuracy in plant disease detection by focusing on traditional optimal estimation and the adoption of artificial intelligence techniques for spatially and temporally distributed big data. When applied across different platforms (handheld, ground-based, airborne, ground/aerial robotic vehicles or satellites), these electro-optical sensors offer new avenues to predict and react to plant stress and disease. This review examines the key sensor characteristics, platform integration options and data analysis techniques recently proposed in the field of precision agriculture and highlights the key challenges and benefits of each concept towards informing future research in this very important and rapidly growing field."
"Contamination of groundwater with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from legacy landfills in an urban re-development precinct Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane The extent of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in groundwater surrounding legacy landfills is currently poorly constrained. Seventeen PFAS were analysed in groundwater surrounding legacy landfills in a major Australian urban re-development precinct. Sampling locations (n = 13) included sites installed directly in waste material and down-gradient from landfills, some of which exhibited evidence of leachate contamination including elevated concentrations of ammonia-N (â‰¤106 mg/L), bicarbonate (â‰¤1,740 mg/L) and dissolved methane (â‰¤10.4 mg/L). Between one and fourteen PFAS were detected at all sites and PFOS, PFHxS, PFOA and PFBS were detected in all samples. The sum of detected PFAS (âˆ‘14PFAS) varied from 26 ng/L at an ambient background site to 5,200 ng/L near a potential industrial point-source. PFHxS had the highest median concentration (34 ng/L; range: 2.6â€“280 ng/L) followed by PFOS (26 ng/L; range: 1.3â€“4,800 ng/L), PFHxA (19 ng/L; range: <LOQ â€“ 46 ng/L) and PFOA (12 ng/L; range: 1.7â€“74 ng/L). Positive correlations between âˆ‘14PFAS, PFOA and other perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) (e.g. PFHxA) with typical leachate indicators including ammonia-N and bicarbonate were observed. In contrast, no such correlations were found with perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) (e.g., PFOS and PFHxS). In addition, a strong positive linear correlation (R2 = 0.69) was found between the proportion of PFOA in the sum of detected perfluorinated alkylated acids (PFOA/âˆ‘PFAA) and ammonia-N concentrations in groundwater. This is consistent with previous research showing relatively high PFOA/âˆ‘PFAA in municipal landfill leachates, and more conservative behaviour (e.g. less sorption and reactivity) of PFCAs during subsurface transport compared to PFSAs. PFOA/âˆ‘PFAA in groundwater may therefore be a useful indicator of municipal landfill-derived PFAA. One site with significantly elevated PFOS and PFHxS concentrations (4,800 and 280 ng/L, respectively) appears to be affected by point-source industrial contamination, as landfill leachate indicators were absent. PFAS have been analysed in groundwater surrounding legacy landfills in a major urban re-development precinct in Australia, to better understand their sources, fate and transport."
"Urban Heat Island and Mitigation in Tropical India Heat Islands; Land Surface Temperature; Land Cover Urban heat island (UHI) studies using ground-based observations are limited in the tropical cities of India. This chapter reviews the UHI studies in the tropical cities located in the southern and central states of the subcontinent, namely Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra. In tropical cities that experience high latent heat fluxes, the thermal environments are also affected by the heterogenous nature of urban settings. Majority of the UHI studies were conducted for a short period using either non-standard stations or mobile surveys, or a combination of these, with the reported UHI intensities ranging from 1.76 to 4.6 Â°C. Comparison between studies are difficult due to the variation in the methodology and the way results are presented. Ground-based measurements deployed in both micro and macro scales informed by high resolution remote sensing outputs will help to address the gap in the current knowledge. Dense network of stations installed using crowd sourcing approach are proven to be beneficial if uncertainties are carefully addressed. This chapter also discusses the application of UHI mitigation strategies established in similar climatic conditions and land use patterns. Mitigation actions including tree planting, use of appropriate materials as well as enhancing ventilation should be carefully chosen according to the geometry and orientation of the streets."
"Pathobiological mechanisms underlying metabolic syndrome (MetS)in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): clinical significance and therapeutic strategies Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; Lung Function; Respiratory Function Tests Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)is a major incurable global health burden and is currently the 4th largest cause of death in the world. Importantly, much of the disease burden and health care utilisation in COPD is associated with the management of its comorbidities (e.g. skeletal muscle wasting, ischemic heart disease, cognitive dysfunction)and infective viral and bacterial acute exacerbations (AECOPD). Current pharmacological treatments for COPD are relatively ineffective and the development of effective therapies has been severely hampered by the lack of understanding of the mechanisms and mediators underlying COPD. Since comorbidities have a tremendous impact on the prognosis and severity of COPD, the 2015 American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS)Research Statement on COPD urgently called for studies to elucidate the pathobiological mechanisms linking COPD to its comorbidities. It is now emerging that up to 50% of COPD patients have metabolic syndrome (MetS)as a comorbidity. It is currently not clear whether metabolic syndrome is an independent co-existing condition or a direct consequence of the progressive lung pathology in COPD patients. As MetS has important clinical implications on COPD outcomes, identification of disease mechanisms linking COPD to MetS is the key to effective therapy. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the potential mechanisms linking MetS to COPD and hence plausible therapeutic strategies to treat this debilitating comorbidity of COPD."
"Ozonolysis as an Effective Pretreatment Strategy for Bioethanol Production from Marine Algae Poly(Beta-D-Mannuronate) Lyase; Alginate; Ethanol Production Marine algae are promising third-generation feedstocks for bioethanol production as they are fast growing, require minimal inputs, and do not compete for land. However, marine algae have complex cell walls which necessitate pretreatment prior to fermentation, and this represents a major component of the cost of bioethanol production. Standard pretreatment processes using acids are costly and generate hazardous waste streams. This study aims to develop an economic and environmentally friendly pretreatment process using ozonolysis for the marine algae Kappaphycus alvarezii and Gelidium amansii. Acid and ozone pretreatments were compared across the pretreatment, enzyme hydrolysis, and fermentation stages of bioethanol production. Acid pretreatment outperformed ozonolysis over the pretreatment and enzyme hydrolysis stages. However, it also generated as by-products the compounds 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF) and levulinic acid (LA), which inhibited ethanol fermentation and reduced the efficiency of the process overall. Ozone pretreatment did not produce these inhibitory compounds, and as such outperformed acid pretreatment across the process as a whole. These results indicate the potential of ozonolysis as an economic and environmentally friendly pretreatment for the production of bioethanol from marine algae."
"Unsustainability at the crossroads of climate change and air pollution sciences: implications for sustainable development and the scholarship of sustainability Indonesia; Swamp Forest; Biomass Burning Release of carbonaceous aerosols â€“ comprising black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) â€“ from biomass burning into the atmosphere is dependent on the burning conditions as to the resultant relative abundances of the emitted BC and OC. This provides a way of managing biomass burning in terms of manipulating the types of emitted aerosol. The carbonaceous aerosols are concerned in different ways in different scientific fields. The BC and OC exert complex implications for (a) radiative forcing in climate change science but (b) public health concern in air pollution science. Referring to these complex implications, a case of sustainability is constructed, which is being unsustainably dealt with at the crossroads of the sciences. This reveals an inadequacy of the reductionist mode of enquiry, necessitating a new mode with unique epistemological orientation for the scholarship of sustainability. The necessity of integration of perspectives that are currently segregated for this sustainability issue and the implications for sustainable development are elucidated.

"Remelt processing and microstructure of selective laser melted Ti25Ta Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) In this study, elemental powder mixtures of Ti25Ta, an alloy with promise for orthopaedic applications, were processed using Selective Laser Melting (SLM), an emerging manufacturing method for bespoke implants. Material density and homogeneity was investigated as a function of laser scan speed and scanning strategy. Dense (>99.99%), pore free material was obtained at optimised processing parameters and a â€˜remeltâ€™ scan strategy improved melting of the Ta powders, avoiding keyhole formation. Tensile and ultrasonic modulus testing of the SLM Ti25Ta revealed that the processed material had a similar yield strength to SLM commercially pure Ti, namely 426 Â± 15 MPa, with a significant reduction of elastic modulus to 65 Â± 5 GPa. The remelt scan strategy increased the yield strength to 545 Â± 9 MPa, without altering the elastic modulus, however reduced the elongation from 25 Â± 1 to 11 Â± 4%. TEM analysis revealed the microstructure consisted of predominantly hexagonal Î±â€² martensite with a limited amount of orthorhombic Î±â€²â€² martensite formed in the Ta-rich regions near partially melted Ta particles, specifically facilitated by enhanced diffusion occurring during the remelt scan. The composition range for the Î±â€²â€² phase was observed to be approximately 40â€“50 wt% Ta. Electron back-scattered imaging (BSI) and back scattered diffraction (EBSD) revealed the formation of the prior Î² grains with close to equiaxed morphology and a slight texture in the Î±â€² martensite. The application of the remelt scan disrupted the prior Î² grain structure and resulted in randomly oriented Î±â€² laths."
"Active and passive drug release by self-assembled lubricin (PRG4) anti-fouling coatings Lubricin; Articular Cartilage; Hydrogel Electroactive polymers (EAPs) have been investigated as materials for use in a range of biomedical applications, ranging from cell culture, electrical stimulation of cultured cells as well as controlled delivery of growth factors and drugs. Despite their excellent drug delivery ability, EAPs are susceptible to biofouling thus they often require surface functionalisation with antifouling coatings to limit unwanted non-specific protein adsorption. Here we demonstrate the surface modification of para toluene sulfonate (pTS) doped polypyrrole with the glycoprotein lubricin (LUB) to produce a self-assembled coating that both prevents surface biofouling while also serving as a high-capacity reservoir for cationic drugs which can then be released passively via diffusion or actively via an applied electrical potential. We carried out our investigation in two parts where we initially assessed the antifouling and cationic drug delivery ability of LUB tethered on a gold surface using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM) to monitor molecular interactions occurring on a gold sensor surface. After confirming the ability of tethered LUB nano brush layers on a gold surface, we introduced an electrochemically grown EAP layer to act as the immobilisation surface for LUB before subsequently introducing the cationic drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX). The release of cationic drug was then investigated under passive and electrochemically stimulated conditions. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was then carried out to quantify the amount of DOX released. It was shown that the amount of DOX released from nano brush layers of LUB tethered on gold and EAP surfaces could be increased by up to 30% per minute by applying a positive electrochemically stimulating pulse at 0.8 V for one minute. Using bovine serum albumin (BSA), we show that DOX loaded LUB tethered on para toluene sulfonic acid (pTS) doped polypyrrole retained antifouling ability of up to 75% when compared to unloaded tethered LUB. This work demonstrates the unique, novel ability of tethered LUB to actively participate in the delivery of cationic therapeutics on different substrate surfaces. This study could lead to the development of versatile multifunctional biomaterials for use in wide range of biomedical applications, such as dual drug delivery and lubricating coatings, dual drug delivery and antifouling coatings, cellular recording and stimulation."
"Intact HIV Proviruses Persist in the Brain Despite Viral Suppression with ART Proviruses; Antiretroviral Therapy; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Objective: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persistence in blood and tissue reservoirs, including the brain, is a major barrier to HIV cure and possible cause of comorbid disease. However, the size and replication competent nature of the central nervous system (CNS) reservoir is unclear. Here, we used the intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) to provide the first quantitative assessment of the intact and defective HIV reservoir in the brain of people with HIV (PWH). Methods: Total, intact, and defective HIV proviruses were measured in autopsy frontal lobe tissue from viremic (n = 18) or virologically suppressed (n = 12) PWH. Total or intact/defective proviruses were measured by detection of HIV pol or the IPDA, respectively, through use of droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). HIV-seronegative individuals were included as controls (n = 6). Results: Total HIV DNA was present at similar levels in brain tissues from untreated viremic and antiretroviral (ART)-suppressed individuals (median = 22.3 vs 26.2 HIV pol copies/106 cells), reflecting a stable CNS reservoir of HIV that persists despite therapy. Furthermore, 8 of 10 viremic and 6 of 9 virally suppressed PWH also harbored intact proviruses in the CNS (4.63 vs 12.7 intact copies/106 cells). Viral reservoirs in CNS and matched lymphoid tissue were similar in the composition of intact and/or defective proviruses, albeit at lower levels in the brain. Importantly, CNS resident CD68+ myeloid cells in virally suppressed individuals harbored HIV DNA, directly showing the presence of a CNS resident HIV reservoir. Interpretation: Our results demonstrate the first evidence for an intact, potentially replication competent HIV reservoir in the CNS of virally suppressed PWH. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:532â€“544."
"Job Quality and Construction Workers' Mental Health: Life Course Perspective Effort-Reward Imbalance; Personnel; Occupational Stress Psychosocial job quality has been proven to be linked to workers' mental health. Drawing on a life course perspective, this study sought to identify, compare, and contrast the psychosocial characteristics of job quality that are related to mental health in three age groups of manual/nonmanagerial construction workers, i.e., young workers, middle-aged workers, and older workers. Data were extracted from the national and longitudinal Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey data set. The study used 15 waves of data from the HILDA survey with 6,352 responses from 1,768 participants. Longitudinal random-intercept regression models were used to examine the association between each of five aspects of job quality (i.e., job demands and complexity, job control, perceived job security, effort-reward fairness, and job intensity) and mental health. Overall, the research results showed that construction workers' mental health declined when experiencing adverse job conditions and the magnitude of decline increased as the number of job adversities increased. Specifically, workers of the midage group experienced more accelerated decline in mental health compared with the other two groups when experiencing two adverse job conditions. Age-related differences were also identified in the way that individual job quality aspects are related to mental health. Although low job security and perceived unfairness of effort and reward were significant predictors of mental ill-health in all age groups, job demand and complexity and high job intensity were predictors of mental ill-health in midage and older construction workers but were not significant contributors to mental ill-health among younger workers. The findings highlight the need to develop targeted approaches to protecting and promoting the mental health of construction workers in different age groups."
"Quantitative Risk Assessment of Seafarers’ Nonfatal Injuries Due to Occupational Accidents Based on Bayesian Network Modeling Seafarers; Fishermen; Occupational Safety Reducing the incidence of seafarersâ€™ workplace injuries is of great importance to shipping and ship management companies. The objective of this study is to identify the important influencing factors and to build a quantitative model for the injury risk analysis aboard ships, so as to provide a decision support framework for effective injury prevention and management. Most of the previous research on seafarersâ€™ occupational accidents either adopts a qualitative approach or applies simple descriptive statistics for analyses. In this study, the advanced method of a Bayesian network (BN) is used for the predictive modeling of seafarer injuries for its interpretative power as well as predictive capacity. The modeling is data driven and based on an extensive empirical survey to collect data on seafarersâ€™ working practice and their injury records during the latest tour of duty, which could overcome the limitation of historical injury databases that mostly contain only data about the injured group instead of the entire population. Using the survey data, a BN model was developed consisting of nine major variables, including â€œPPE availability,â€ â€œAge,â€ and â€œExperienceâ€ of the seafarers, which were identified to be the most influential risk factors. The model was validated further with several tests through sensitivity analyses and logical axiom test. Finally, implementation of the result toward decision support for safety management in the global shipping industry was discussed."
"A conceptual analysis of social housing as infrastructure Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Safe, adequate, affordable and appropriate housing is critical to health, wellbeing, and social and economic security. However, many Australians cannot find housing in the private market, and the social housing system is under-resourced and manifestly unable to meet demand. In response to this, there is emerging interest in whether reconceptualising social housing as a form of essential infrastructure might help to attract additional investment, especially from private sector sources. The case for social housing as infrastructure rests on the following findings. Social housing can more strongly position itself as a form of infrastructure by making better use of infrastructure policy conventions, including cost-benefit analysis and business cases. Government intervention in response to significant housing needs, challenges and failures in the Australian housing market is both reasonable and warranted, but the true extent of the problem needs to be accurately recognised as extending beyond the margins of the market. Government budget prioritiesâ€”in particular the lack of priority given to social housingâ€”are the principal reasons for the lack of investment in the Australian social housing system. There is a strong historical precedent for the Australian social housing system as a contributor to economic growth and productivity, and as providing the basis for a decent and equitable society. Although the case can be made that social housing is infrastructure, this is not sufficient for making the case for social housing. Policy makers need to make better use of cost-benefit analysis techniques and other methods for making the business case for social housing, while ensuring that those aspects of social housing that are not easily quantified or monetised are not overlooked or excluded. Policy makers, together with academics, providers, advocates and tenant groups, need to advance stronger arguments in favour of direct government involvement in the provision and financing of social and affordable housing that focus on the achievement of a broader set of social and economic purposes."
"Potential fluoride exposure from selected food crops grown in high fluoride soils in the Makueni County, south-eastern Kenya Fluorides; Pollution; Euphausia Superba Makueni County, located in south-eastern Kenya, faces challenges such as limited potable water and restricted food supplies as the result of semi-aridity. High fluoride (F) concentrations have been reported in drinking water with resultant dental fluorosis affecting the local population. To determine the potential F exposure through the consumption of food crops grown in the area, F concentration was assessed in the main five locally grown and consumed crops. Additionally, the water-soluble F fraction was determined from 30 soil samples with mineralogical determination of 20 samples. Mean F concentration in the food crops was in the order; 700, 288, 71.2, 36.6, and 29 mg/kg in kale, cowpeas leaves, green grams, cowpeas (legume portion), and maize, respectively. The F concentration in farm soils ranged from 0 to 3.47 mg/kg (mean of 0.87 mg/kg) and showed a significant strong positive correlation (p = 0.03, r = 0.89) with F values in the crops. Apatite, muscovite, and biotite were identified as the F-rich minerals present. While considering two hypothetical F absorption fractions (75 and 100%), the estimated average daily dose (EADD) of F from consuming the crops ranged between 0.004 and 65.17 mg/kg/day where the highest values were from the vegetables. Most of these values were higher than the F reference dose (RfD) of 0.06 mg/kg. The estimated EADD values of several hypothetical meals prepared from the analyzed crops revealed that steamed kale and maize porridge pose the highest health risk of F associated diseases to the local population, whereas boiled cowpeas pose no health risk. Children, due to their higher daily energy requirement and low body weight, were the most vulnerable group at risk of high daily F intake relative to the RfD. These results suggest that consumption of the analyzed food crops in Makueni County may significantly contribute to F related diseases in the local population. This creates a food security issue for the area because of the potential health risks associated with these crops which are highly relied upon in the semi-arid area with a limited selection of food crops available and viable to grow."
"Exploring the food value chain using open innovation: a bibliometric review of the literature Alliance Portfolios; Firm; Open Innovation Purpose: This paper reviews the literature, foundational works and current trends related to the adoption of open innovation (OI) practices in the food industry, with a particular focus on the food value chain, using a bibliometric and content analysis approach. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on 84 published documents in the field of food OI obtained using the Scopus database. First, a bibliometric analysis was conducted using a bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis approach to understand the common themes and key clusters of food OI research. It further highlighted authors, countries, journals, years of publication and subject areas to comprehend the scope of the established literature. Second, a content analysis was undertaken to examine the titles and abstracts of the documents to explore the intersection of OI and the food value chain. Findings: This study provides an integrated framework of the intersection of OI and the food value chain, including information about under-researched and emerging areas in the field of food innovation. It also highlights the critical challenges associated with OI food research and practices. Practical implications: Practitioners can use the findings to uncover areas with limited open innovation adoption in the food value chain. They can identify extended research areas to explore the food value chain using an open innovation perspective, in different contexts within the food and beverage (F&B) industry. The framework can also be used for conducting comparative studies of current food innovation trends across different contexts within the F&B industry. Originality/value: By adopting a multi-step approach involving a computer-assisted bibliometric examination complemented by a manual review undertaken through the lens of the food value chain, this literature review provides fresh and unique insights into past and present research on OI in the food industry and paves the way for future studies by laying out specific research avenues."
"Improvement of log reduction values design equations for helminth egg management in recycled water Ascaris; Pathogens; Helminths Understanding and managing the risk posed by helminth eggs (HE) is a key concern for wastewater engineers and public health regulators. The treatment processes that produce recycled water from sewage at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) rely on achieving a defined log10 reduction value (LRV) in HE concentration during the production of recycled water from sewage to achieve the guideline concentration of â‰¤1.0 HE/L. The total concentration of HE in sewage reaches thousands of HE/L in developing countries and therefore, an LRV of 4.0 is generally accepted to achieve a safe concentration in recycled water, as this will meet the guideline value. However, in many developed countries with good sanitation and public health standards, the HE concentration in sewage is generally <10 HE/L. Therefore, validation of the sewage treatment process relied on to achieve an LRV of 4.0 can be difficult. Because of these limitations, design equations to predict LRVs from hydraulic retention times (HRT), which are geographically non-specific, are commonly relied on to ensure the production of safe quality recycled water with respect to HE. However, these design equations could be further refined by defining the design and management of the treatment process in greater detail and thus be used more effectively for determining the LRV required. This paper discusses the limitations and possible improvements that could be applied to LRV design equations for predicting HE removal at WWTPs and identifies the data requirements to support these improvements. Several options for LRV design equations are proposed that could be validated experimentally or via the ongoing operation of WWTPs. These improvements have the potential to assist the rationalization of the HE removal requirements for specific treatment options, exposure scenarios and use of recycled water in agriculture."
"Understanding the mechanisms driving the spread of subtype C HIV-1 Phylogeny; HIV-1; RNA Directed DNA Polymerase Inhibitor Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C (C-HIV) is the most prevalent form of HIV-1 globally, accounting for approximately 50% of infections worldwide. C-HIV is the predominant and near-exclusive subtype in the low resource regions of India and Southern Africa. Given the vast diversity of HIV-1 subtypes, it is curious as to why C-HIV constitutes such a large proportion of global infections. This enriched prevalence may be due to phenotypic differences between C-HIV isolates and other viral strains that permit enhanced transmission efficiency or, pathogenicity, or might due to the socio-demographics of the regions where C-HIV is endemic. Here, we compare the mechanisms of C-HIV pathogenesis to less prominent HIV-1 subtypes, including viral genetic and phenotypic characteristics, and host genetic variability, to understand whether evolutionary factors drove C-HIV to predominance."
"Tourism Xenophilia: Examining Attraction to Foreignness Travel Motivation; Music Festival; Destination Individuals have demonstrated an attraction toward foreignness, which, arguably, constitutes a central reason to travel. Drawing on research from social and evolutionary psychology, the authors provide the first investigation of tourism xenophilia (TXI), which we define as individualsâ€™ attraction toward the perceived foreignness of destinations. Across three studies, the authors conceptualize, develop, and apply a reliable, valid, and parsimonious TXI scale. The results show that TXI explains several important tourist and resident behaviors, such as willingness to engage with locals, willingness to stay at a bed-and-breakfast, intention to try local food, resident hospitality, support for immigration policies, and travel to foreign destinations. The authors also empirically investigate three key antecedents of TXI: promotion focus, boredom proneness, and mind-wandering. Finally, implications for academics and practitioners are discussed."
"Functional analysis of pristine estuarine marine sediments Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus Traditional environmental monitoring techniques are well suited to resolving acute exposure effects but lack resolution in determining subtle shifts in ecosystem functions resulting from chronic exposure(s). Surveillance with sensitive omics-based technologies could bridge this gap but, to date, most omics-based environmental studies have focused on previously degraded environments, identifying key metabolic differences resulting from anthropogenic perturbations. Here, we apply omics-based approaches to pristine environments to establish blueprints of microbial functionality within healthy estuarine sediment communities. We collected surface sediments (n = 50) from four pristine estuaries along the Western Cape York Peninsula of Far North Queensland, Australia. Sediment microbiomes were analyzed for 16S rRNA amplicon sequences, central carbon metabolism metabolites and associated secondary metabolites via targeted and untargeted metabolic profiling methods. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated heterogeneity among all the sampled estuaries, however, taxa-function relationships could be established that predicted community metabolism potential. Twenty-four correlated gene-metabolite pathways were identified and used to establish sediment microbial blueprints of essential carbon metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis that were positively correlated with community metabolic function outputs (2-oxisocapraote, tryptophan, histidine citrulline and succinic acid). In addition, an increase in the 125 KEGG genes related to metal homeostasis and metal resistance was observed, although, none of the detected metabolites related to these specific genes upon integration. However, there was a correlation between metal abundance and functional genes related to Fe and Zn metabolism. Our results establish a baseline microbial blueprint for the pristine sediment microbiome, one that drives important ecosystem services and to which future ecosurveillance monitoring can be compared."
"Characterization for Cleaner and Sustainable Production of Glycerol from Tallow Under Aqueous Media at High Pressure and Temperature Transesterification; Catalyst; Rubber Seed Oil Tallow fat is used in pharmaceuticals and also as raw material for the synthesis of glycerine which is used in oleo-chemical industries. In this study, steam-hydrolysis of animal tallow has been carried out to obtain glycerol by high pressure, temperature hydrolysis method without catalyst. The effect of process parameters such as feed ratio and temperature on the production of glycerol by hydrolysis has been studied. The beef tallow has been characterized by TGA for thermal stability where it shows slight decomposition in three stages: 59 Â°C, 187 Â°C, and 293 Â°C leaving 80.96% residue. H1 NMR profile shows doublet-of-doublets arising from two methylene groups and a multiplet for the CH-proton. 13C-NMR of the product demonstrated signals at 62.58 and 72.11 ppm, indicating the presence of the aliphatic carbon in the 1Â°- and 2Â°-alcohol of the final product glycerol. The 1:4 blend of (water to tallow) under 256 Â°C and 60 bar pressure has been recorded as an optimal operating condition (non-catalytic) to yield a degree of hydrolysis of 98.4%. The degree FTIR analysis shows a peak at 3300 cmâˆ’1 due to the presence of water and glycerol which in turn indicates the presence of glycerol."
"Towards Sustainable Environmental Quality: Priority Research Questions for the Australasian Region of Oceania Ethinylestradiol; Endocrine Disruptors; Wastewater Treatment Environmental challenges persist across the world, including the Australasian region of Oceania, where biodiversity hotspots and unique ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef are common. These systems are routinely affected by multiple stressors from anthropogenic activities, and increasingly influenced by global megatrends (e.g., the foodâ€“energyâ€“water nexus, demographic transitions to cities) and climate change. Here we report priority research questions from the Global Horizon Scanning Project, which aimed to identify, prioritize, and advance environmental quality research needs from an Australasian perspective, within a global context. We employed a transparent and inclusive process of soliciting key questions from Australasian members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. Following submission of 78 questions, 20 priority research questions were identified during an expert workshop in Nelson, New Zealand. These research questions covered a range of issues of global relevance, including research needed to more closely integrate ecotoxicology and ecology for the protection of ecosystems, increase flexibility for prioritizing chemical substances currently in commerce, understand the impacts of complex mixtures and multiple stressors, and define environmental quality and ecosystem integrity of temporary waters. Some questions have specific relevance to Australasia, particularly the uncertainties associated with using toxicity data from exotic species to protect unique indigenous species. Several related priority questions deal with the theme of how widely international ecotoxicological data and databases can be applied to regional ecosystems. Other timely questions, which focus on improving predictive chemistry and toxicology tools and techniques, will be important to answer several of the priority questions identified here. Another important question raised was how to protect local cultural and social values and maintain indigenous engagement during problem formulation and identification of ecosystem protection goals. Addressing these questions will be challenging, but doing so promises to advance environmental sustainability in Oceania and globally."
"Catalytic degradation of methylene blue using iron and nitrogen-containing carbon dots as Fenton-like catalysts Fluorescence; Nanodots; Carbon Nanoparticles Wastewater pollution is an existing and serious environmental issue. One of the main wastewater pollution sources is from the dyestuff industries and its discharge poses a serious threat to the ecosystem due to its adverse effects on human and environmental health. Conventional wastewater treatments are limited in terms of effectively treating such non-biodegradable contaminants; thus, this work aimed to investigate the degradation of the commercial dye methylene blue (MB)viaadvanced oxidation processes (AOPs) using carbon dots as Fenton-like catalysts. Iron and nitrogen-containing carbon dots (Fe, N-CDs) were synthesised through a hydrothermal reaction and utilised as catalysts in the degradation of MB. Multiple characterisation techniques were employed to describe the dot properties including FTIR, XPS, TEM,Î¶-potential, PL and UV-Vis analyses. Characterisation revealed the synthesis of 7 nm diameter, spherical negatively charged dots rich in iron and nitrogen surface functionalities. Methylene blue was degraded under mild conditions using an innovative green remediation technology which removed nearly 100% of the dye (20 mg Lâˆ’1) under optimised conditions (at 50 Â°C, pH 8, H2O2147 mM, and a catalyst concentration of 0.5 mg mLâˆ’1) in only 60 minutes. The active mechanism of the Fe, N-CDs was deduced suggesting the participation of free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygens and holes. Importantly, the effluent toxicity assessed using MicrotoxÂ® confirmed the generation of a non-toxic effluent. This investigation showed that using Fe, N-CDs is an effective way to degrade wastewater pollution whilst significantly minimising its toxicity."
"Building capacity for a user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought in the Northern Murray-Darling Basin Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China Drought frequently impacts both the agricultural productivity and the well-being of farming communities in drought-prone areas of Australia, including the largest agricultural region in the countryâ€”the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). Improving drought preparedness of farming communities in the MDB could be achieved by building capacity for a user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought. In this study, a prospective I-EWS was investigated. Farming individuals were interviewed to inductively guide the selection of drought-related indices most appropriate for the study area. Based on interview results and desktop research, five drought-related indices directly relevant to the MDB were selected as inputs to the trigger levels for an I-EWS: the Standardised Precipitation Index, the Vegetation Health Index, Soil Moisture (percent of normal), the likelihood of exceeding median rainfall in a coming month, and the chance of El NiÃ±o. Based on these inputs, decision rules were formulated for a staged â€œWATCH,â€ â€œALERTâ€ and â€œDECLARATIONâ€ drought early warnings. These decision rules were tested for the intense dry period from 2017 to 2019 for five key agricultural Local Government Areas in the Northern MDB. It was found that all three stages of the drought I-EWS were adequately triggered, indicating that a warning lead time of 3â€“8 months could have been possible in the dry period. Data for the selected inputs are readily obtained from space-based products as well as national meteorological services and would be applicable to regions with limited observing networks or forecast capability. Thus, while the methodologies developed in this study and the resultant outcomes are tailored to the Northern MDB, this research ultimately serves as both a successful proof of concept for the drought EWS as well as a foundational base for the design of an operational user-centred I-EWS in susceptible to drought regions of Australia and other countries."
"On the need for a nuanced understanding of “community” in heritage policy and practice Residence Characteristics; Narrative; Nations The alleged benefits of community participation in cultural resource management has been an article of faith in the international heritage community since the early 1990s, yet the ambiguous and multi-layered concept of community is commonly deployed uncritically. This chapter argues that â€œcommunityâ€ should be seen as an open-ended, never complete process rather than end-product. It suggests that heritage practitioners inevitably contribute to the creation of a sense of community at scales ranging from the local to the national. The projection of community identities can enhance or undermine social cohesion at and across geographic scales and the chapter argues that heritage practitioners need to work with a nuanced understanding of their role in the creation of community identities. The link between heritage values and community formation remains powerful but the power needs to be unleashed with due diligence."
"Communication about sexual orientation and gender between clinicians, LGBT+ people facing serious illness and their significant others: A qualitative interview study of experiences, preferences and recommendations Transgender Persons; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Sexual Behavior Background Healthcare organisations have legal and ethical duties to reduce inequalities in access to healthcare services and related outcomes. However, lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender (LGBT+) people continue to experience and anticipate discrimination in health and social care. Skilled communication is vital for quality person-centred care, but there is inconsistent provision of evidence-based clinician education on health needs and experiences of LGBT+ people to support this. This study aimed to identify key stakeholders' experiences, preferences and best practices for communication regarding sexual orientation, gender identity and gender history in order to reduce inequalities in healthcare. Methods Semistructured qualitative interviews with LGBT+ patients with serious illness, significant others and clinicians, recruited via UK-wide LGBT+ groups, two hospitals and one hospice in England. We analysed the interview data using reflexive thematic analysis. Results 74 stakeholders participated: 34 LGBT+ patients with serious illness, 13 significant others and 27 multiprofessional clinicians. Participants described key communication strategies to promote inclusive practice across three domains: (1) â‚¬ Creating positive first impressions and building rapport' were central to relationship building and enacted through routine use of inclusive language, avoiding potentially negative non-verbal signals and echoing terminology used by patients and caregivers; (2) â‚¬ Enhancing care by actively exploring and explaining the relevance of sexual orientation and gender identity', participants described the benefits of clinicians initiating these discussions, pursuing topics guided by the patient's response or expressed preferences for disclosure. Active involvement of significant others was encouraged to demonstrate recognition of the relationship; these individual level actions are underpinned by a foundation of (3) â‚¬ visible and consistent LGBT+ inclusiveness in care systems'. Although participants expressed hesitance talking about LGBT+ identities with individuals from some sociocultural and religious backgrounds, there was widespread support for institutions to adopt a standardised, LGBT+ inclusive, visibly supportive approach. Conclusions Person-centred care can be enhanced by incorporating discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity into routine clinical practice. Inclusive language and sensitive exploration of relationships and identities are core activities. Institutions need to support clinicians through provision of adequate training, resources, inclusive monitoring systems, policies and structures. Ten inclusive communication recommendations are made based on the data."
"Metabolite changes in an estuarine annelid following sublethal exposure to a mixture of zinc and boscalid Homarine; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Daphnia Magna Environmental pollutants such as heavy metals and fungicides pose a serious threat to waterways worldwide. Toxicological assessment of such contaminants is usually conducted using single compound exposures, as it is challenging to understand the effect of mixtures on biota using standard ecotoxicological methods; whereas complex chemical mixtures are more probable in ecosystems. This study exposed Simplisetia aequisetis (an estuarine annelid) to sublethal concentrations of a metal (zinc) and a fungicide (boscalid), both singly and as a mixture, for two weeks. Metabolomic analysis via gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure the stress response(s) of the organism following exposure. A total of 75 metabolites, including compounds contributing to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the urea cycle, and a number of other pathways, were identified and quantified. The multiplatform approach identified distinct metabolomic responses to each compound that differed depending on whether the substance was presented singly or as a mixture, indicating a possible antagonistic effect. The study demonstrates that metabolomics is able to elucidate the effects and mode of action of contaminants and can identify possible outcomes faster than standard ecotoxicological endpoints, such as growth and reproduction. Metabolomics therefore has a possible future role in biomonitoring and ecosystem health assessments."
"Long-Term Wind Power Forecasting Using Tree-Based Learning Algorithms Wind Speed; Neural Networks; Prediction Interval The intermittent and uncertain nature of wind places a premium on accurate wind power forecasting for the reliable and efficient operation of power grids with large-scale wind power penetration. Herein, six-month-ahead wind power forecasting models were developed using tree-based learning algorithms. Three models were developed to investigate the impact of input data on forecasting accuracy. The first model was trained with the average and standard deviation of wind speed values measured at a height of 40 m with a 10-min sampling time. To evaluate the impact of sampling time on model performance, a second model was trained with wind speed values measured at a height of 40 m with 1-h, 12-h, and 24-h sampling times. To assess the effect of measuring height on model accuracy, the third model was trained with wind speed values measured at 40 m extrapolated from values measured at heights of 30 m and 10 m. Experiments revealed that using longer time intervals and height extrapolation leads to considerable accuracy degradation in forecasted models. Finally, to study the generalization ability of the forecasted models, they were tested against wind data measured at heights and locations different from what the models had been trained with. Simulation results substantiated that tree-based learning algorithms can be successfully adopted not only for long-term wind power forecasting, but for potential wind power forecasting at different heights and geographical locations."
"Awareness of intellectual capital among bank executives in India: a survey Intellectual Capital; Value-Added Intellectual Coefficient; Intangible Assets Purpose: This paper aims to explore the awareness of terminology related to intellectual capital (IC) among executives of Indian banks and the sources in which they mostly find IC-related terminology. The paper also explores relative and specific contributions of each selected source of information in creating IC awareness among bank executives in India and determines difference among the executives from the public and private sector. Design/methodology/approach: This research paper follows a survey-based approach to capture the perceptions of Indian bank managers working middle and top management across different banks. Regression analysis and ANOVA were applied to data from 166 responses. Findings: The study finds that IC awareness among Indian banking executives is reasonably high and is equally spread across the three sub-categories of capital (external capital, human capital and internal capital), though the relative awareness of external capital is on the higher side. However, the sources of awareness of IC terminology differ among executives from the public- and private-sector banks. Research limitations/implications: The sample was limited to middle and top managers in the Indian banking industry and suffers from the usual limitations of survey-based research such as the design of the survey instrument and the personal biases of the respondents. Some limitations may also have arisen because of the definitions of IC elements adopted by this study. Originality/value: This research adds a new dimension to the IC research by exploring the practical application and awareness of IC that deviates from traditional annual report-based disclosure and valuation studies. No existing literature has examined the survey-based awareness study, particularly on the banking industry. This paper provides a foundation for future studies that examine the operational awareness and application of IC in the service industries."
"Ethical considerations for conservation messaging research and practice Social Media; Organization-public Relationships; Strategic Communication Conservation professionals are familiar with value-driven research and practice. However, recent efforts to use strategic communication, specifically conservation messaging, to affect targeted behaviour change or influence values and attitudes towards conservation introduce new ethical dilemmas that conservation professionals may not have considered or are ill-equipped to deal with. Drawing from strategic communication theory and professional guidelines, including from public relations, social marketing, advocacy, and the social sciences more broadly, we provide a framework and discuss important ethical considerations for conservation messaging. The considerations discussed include those that apply across all stages of conservation messaging (be reflexive, engage responsibly, and consider power), as well as those that apply when defining the problem (ensure fairness in audience targeting), designing the solution (use equitable messages and calls to action and use truthful messaging and authentic messengers), and considering outcomes (consider intended and unintended consequences). We present these considerations not as a fail-safe checklist to prevent unethical conduct in conservation messaging, but rather as points of reflection to consider in the design of ethical conservation messages and campaigns. We present a series of prompting questions to guide this process. We believe taking the time to reflect in this way paves the way for more effective and ethical strategies for conservation messaging, leading to more open, trusting, and sustainable relationships with our audiences.

"Proposing a Real-Time Ticket Monitoring System for Public Transport in NSW, Australia Global System For Mobile Communications; Theft; Internet Of Things The public transport system of New South Wales (NSW), Australia is impotent to receive 100% of the fare from light rail and buses due to the unavailability of a continuous real-time monitoring system. This scheme thereby seeks to help update the NSW public transport ticket collection system, with the aid of a counter that will be integrated into the public transportation within the Ticket Tapping Machine, to provide passenger count against the number of touches occurring at each stop; and thus, increasing the revenue. The product comprises of hardware and software components-the hardware system is located within the public transport while the software system incorporating a web portal is positioned for the authorities to have access to the real-time passenger data. At the hardware end, the ultrasonic sensors and the raspberry pi would detect the number of passengers on the transport and the LCD screen would display the number of passengers who had not tapped their smart card ticket. Additionally, the raspberry pi module used in the hardware component can denote the transportation location with the help of an in-built Wi-Fi component. With this designed technology, the authorities would be able to monitor and record the movements of the passenger in real-time system addressing the existing challenges faced by the NSW public transport authority, especially in the case of light rail and buses being used for free by certain passengers."
"Dataset of Vietnamese teachers’ habits and motivation behind continuous professional development programs participation Psychological Practice; School Improvement; Professional Learning In every educational system, teacher development has a vital role in its sector and the health of the social, cultural, and economic sectors. For this redeeming feature, all stakeholders such as education policymakers, school superintendents, and school faculties make a big room for teachers' improvement throughout continuous professional development (CPD) provisions. However, to embark on a new educational adventure is a challenging target to meet, especially when the teacher frames their teaching and learning concept years after years. We decided to survey Vietnamese teachers' habits and motivation to trace their origin back to teachers' partaking reason in these programs. This dataset acquisition occurred from 24 Sep 2019 to 26 Mar 2020 and approached public and private schools (using traditional, bi-lingual, or international curriculum). Overall, the dataset includes 464 observations (263 Vietnamese teachers and 202 expatriate teachers) from 48 K-12 schools across Vietnam. The researchers divided this dataset into three main sections, including (i) The demographic information; (ii) Teacher's CPD habits; and (iii) Teacher's perceptions concerning Project-based and Problem-based Learning (PBL)."
"Managing obesity through natural polyphenols: A review Quercetin; Flavanols; Flavonoid Obesity is a pervasive global health problem needing urgent research and regulatory attention. Although synthetic anti-obesity drugs are available, they come with considerable risk of adverse effects and variable outcomes. Thus, there is a growing trend globally in using natural compounds for management of obesity. There is a considerable body of knowledge, supported by rigorous experimental data, that natural polyphenols can be effective and safer alternative for managing obesity through food and food fortification. This review documents the status of research on anti-obesity mechanisms and critically evaluates the effectiveness of natural polyphenolic compounds that are currently used for management of obesity. It summarizes different mechanisms of anti-obesity action associated with the enzymes, energy expenditure, appetite suppression, adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism and gut microbiota by various natural polyphenols. It also critically evaluates the in vitro, animal and clinical experimental data that support the anti-obesity potential of natural polyphenols. Most of the published data indicate that natural phenolic compounds can be effectively utilized as food or fortified foods, to manage obesity. However, there is still a need for systematic and targeted clinical studies before these natural compounds can be used as the mainstream therapy for managing obesity."
"Governance and planning in a ‘perfect storm’: Securitising climate change, migration and Covid-19 in Sweden Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience The article describes and reflects upon how multi-level governance and planning in Sweden have been affected by and reacted upon three pending major challenges confronting humanity, namely climate change, migration and the Covid-19 pandemic. These â€˜crisesâ€™ are broadly considered â€˜existential threatsâ€™ in need of â€˜securitisationâ€™. Causes and adequate reactions are contested, and there are no given solutions how to securitise the perceived threats, neither one by one, no less together. Government securitisation strategies are challenged by counter-securitisation demands, and plaguing vulnerable groups in society by in-securitising predicaments. Taking Sweden as an example the article applies an analytical approach drawing upon strands of securitisation, governance and planning theory. Targeting policy responses to the three perceived crises the intricate relations between government levels, responsibilities, capacities, and actions are scrutinized, including a focus upon the role of planning. Overriding research questions are: How has the governance and planning system â€“ central, regional and local governments - in Sweden responded to the challenges of climate change, migration and Covid-19? What threats were identified? What solutions were proposed? What consequences could be traced? What prospects wait around the corner? Comparing crucial aspects of the crisesâ€™ anatomies the article adds to the understanding of the way multilevel, cross-sectional, hybrid governance and planning respond to concurrent crises, thereby also offering clues for action in other geopolitical contexts. The article mainly draws upon recent and ongoing research on manifestations of three cases in the Swedish context. Applying a pragmatic, methodological approach combining elements of securitisation, governance and planning theories with Carol Lee Bacchi's â€˜What is the problem represented to beâ€™ and a touch of interpretive/narrative theory, the study reveals distinct differences between the anatomies of the three crises and their handling. Urgency, extension, state of knowledge/epistemology, governance and planning make different imprints on crises management. Sweden's long-term climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies imply slow, micro-steps forward based on a combination of social-liberal, â€˜circularâ€™ and a touch of â€˜green growthâ€™ economies. Migration policy displays a Janus face, on the one hand largely respecting the UN refugee quota system on the other hand applying a detailed regulatory framework causing severe insecurity especially for minor refugees wanting to stay and make their living in Sweden. The Covid-19 outbreak revealed a lack of foresight and eroded/fragmented responsibility causing huge stress upon personnel in elderly and health care and appalling death rates among elderly patients, although governance and planning slowly adapted through securitising policies, leading to potential de-securitisation of the issue. The three crises have caused a security wake-up among governments at all levels and the public in general, and the article concludes by discussing whether this â€˜perfect stormâ€™ of crises will result in a farewell to neoliberalism â€“ towards a neo-regulatory state facing further challenges and crises for governance, planning and the role of planners. The tentative prospect rather indicates a mixture of context-dependent â€˜hybrid governanceâ€™, thus also underlining the crucial role of plannersâ€™ role as â€˜chameleonsâ€™ in complicated governance processes of politics, policy and planning."
"Social marketing and social movements: creating inclusive social change coalitions Social Marketing; Wicked Problems; Marketers Purpose: This paper contributes to emerging discourse about social movements in social marketing by examining how tensions, issues and challenges may arise in areas of social change that have attracted social movements and the ways actors can come together to drive inclusive social change agendas. Design/methodology/approach: Through the lens of new social movement theory, a case study of the interactions and dynamics between fat activists and obesity prevention public health actors is examined. This is undertaken through a multi-method qualitative analysis of interview and archival blog data of fat activists located in Australia, which was compared with the campaign materials and formative and evaluative research related to two high profile Australian Government funded anti-obesity campaigns. Findings: The case analysis highlights the disconnect between public health actors and the marginalized voices of those they are meant to be representing. Whilst public health actors characterise obesity as a social issue of individual responsibility, disease and rational-decision making; fat activists frame a competing collective identity of well-being, support and self-acceptance that characterise their social change efforts. Research limitations/implications: This research highlights how complexities arise but can potentially be overcome in creating inclusive social change coalitions that incorporate the voices of citizen groups whom have mobilised into social movements. Specifically, we highlight the importance of generating a common language around obesity, the significance of collaborative and supportive relations and the need to create common unity through emotional investment and returns - a departure from the highly rational approaches taken by most social change programs. Practical implications: Obesity is a complex social issue marked by conflict and contestation between those who are obese and the very actors working to support them. Our research contends that creating an inclusive social change coalition between these stakeholders will require a shift towards language anchored in well-being as opposed to disease, relations defined by support as opposed to an emphasis on individual responsibility and emotional investments that work to bolster self-acceptance in place of rational appeals as to the â€œcorrectâ€ behaviours one should chose to engage in. Such steps will ensure social change program design is collaborative and incorporates the lived experiences of the very citizens such initiatives are targeted towards. Originality/value: We contribute to wider discussions in social marketing about the development of holistic and progressive, multi-stakeholder, multi-level programs by advocating that inclusive social change coalitions united through the collective identity elements of cognitions and language, relational ties and emotional investment offer an important step forward in tackling the wicked problems that social marketers work to address."
"Effective thermal conductivity of an intact heterogeneous limestone Rock; Shales; Gas Permeability The Cobourg limestone is a very low porosity rock consisting of lighter nodular regions that are predominantly calcite and darker regions consisting of calcite, quartz, dolomite, and an appreciable clay fraction. This paper presents the application of the theory of multi-phasic composites to estimate the possible maximum effective thermal conductivity of the heterogeneous rocks. The thermal conductivity estimates are expected to be representative of the intact rock, without fractures or fissures that can influence the heat conduction process. The estimates are therefore indicative of the thermal properties of the rock in undisturbed regions unaffected by the influences of stress relief and excavation damage during construction of deep ground repositories for the disposal of heat-emitting nuclear waste."
"Designing an integrated urban growth prediction model: a scenario-based approach for preserving scenic landscapes Sleuths; Cellular Automaton Model; Urbanization This study demonstrates the integration of landscape aesthetic quality and probable urban growth patterns in urban landscape modelling. This was performed using SLEUTH as a scenario-based urban growth model in Gorgan City of Iran. Future urbanization was predicted under developing three different scenarios including historical, managed and aesthetically sound urban growth up to the year 2030. Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network model was conducted for mapping the aesthetic suitability of the study area. The aesthetic suitability layer was used in the third scenario of SLEUTH model as the excluded layer to protect the scenic patches in future. The results showed that by correct implementation of urban growth policies, 323 ha in the second scenario and 650 ha in the third scenario would be saved. This integrated model would help the planners for a better management of urban landscapes as a Spatial Decision Support System."
"Study protocol for the Healthier Wealthier Families (HWF) pilot randomised controlled trial: Testing the feasibility of delivering financial counselling to families with young children who are identified as experiencing financial hardship by community-based nurses Mental Health Care; Primary Care; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Introduction Poverty and deprivation can harm children's future health, learning, economic productivity and societal participation. The Australian Healthier Wealthier Families project seeks to reduce the childhood inequities caused by poverty and deprivation by creating a systematic referral pathway between two free, community-based services: Universal, well-child nursing services, which provide health and development support to families with children from birth to school entry, and financial counselling. By adapting the successful Scottish 'Healthier Wealthier Children' model, the objectives of this Australian pilot are to test the (1) feasibility of systematising the referral pathway, and (2) short-term impacts on household finances, caregiver health, parenting efficacy and financial service use. Methods and analysis This pilot randomised controlled trial will run in three sites across two Australian states (Victoria and New South Wales), recruiting a total of 180 participants. Nurses identify eligible caregivers with a 6-item, study-designed screening survey for financial hardship. Caregivers who report one or more risk factors and consent are randomised. The intervention is financial counselling. The comparator is usual care plus information from a government money advice website. Feasibility will be evaluated using the number/proportion of caregivers who complete screening, consent and research measures, and access financial counselling. Though powered to assess feasibility, impacts will be measured 6 months post-enrolment with qualitative interviews and questionnaires about caregiver-reported income, loans and costs (adapted from national surveys, for example, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey); health (General Health Questionnaire 1, EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale short-form); efficacy (from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children); and financial service use (study-designed) compared between arms. Ethics and dissemination Ethics committees of the Royal Children's Hospital (HREC/57372/RCHM-2019) and South West Sydney Local Health District (2019/ETH13455) have approved the study. Participants and stakeholders will receive results through regular communication channels comprising meetings, presentations and publications."
"Comparing sustainable public procurement in the education and health sectors Innovation; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Tendering Insights into organisational knowledge sharing of the sustainable procurement phenomenon are limited, especially across developing countries. A comparative research approach addresses such a limitation, as it makes available the experiences and practices of multiple entities simultaneously. Comparative research highlights important attributes such as similarities and differences, as well as strengths and weaknesses, thereby facilitating knowledge and experience sharing for enhanced organisational practices. In this study, the public procurement practices of Ghana's education and health sectors are selected for comparison on the basis of their strategic salience for sustainability outcomes, the substantial purchasing power entailed in their activities, and their significant importance in Ghana's public sector and economy. Employing comparative research as the core approach, a survey was conducted across 153 organisations, and useable data from 76 of these organisations were obtained; representing a 49.67% response rate. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and a two-tailed independent samples t-test technique. The results indicate the following three key findings: i) sustainable procurement practices in Ghana's health sector are stronger than related practices in the education sector; ii) practices in the two sectors are similar in terms of human rights and safety, but different in terms of environment, philanthropy, and diversity dimensions; and iii) the general state of sustainable procurement practice in the two sectors is moderate. This study contributes fresh insights by comparing sustainable procurement practices of two public sectors of critical importance in Ghana's economy, as well as a perspective on relevant practices in an African domain; a context about which little is known in the extant literature. These new insights have implications for relevant knowledge and experience sharing, capacity building, and enhanced practices."
"Dynamic effect of operational regulation on the mesophilic biomethanation of grape marc Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production Wine production annually generates an estimated 11 million metric tonnes of grape marc (GM) worldwide. The diversion of this organic waste away from landfill and towards its use in the generation of renewable energy has been investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of operational parameters relating to the treatment regime and inoculum source in the extraction of methane from GM under unmixed anaerobic conditions at 35â—¦C. The study entailed the recirculation of a previously acclimated sludge (120 days) as downstream inoculum, an increased loading volume (1.3 kg) and a low substrate-to-inoculum ratio (10:3 SIR). The results showed that an incorporation of accessible operational controls can effectively enhance cumulative methane yield (0.145 m3 CH4 kgâˆ’1 VS), corresponding to higher amounts of digestible organics converted. The calculated average volumetric methane productivity equalled 0.8802 L CH4 LWorkâˆ’1 dâˆ’1 over 33.6 days whilst moderate pollutant removal (43.50% COD removal efficiency) was achieved. Molecular analyses identified Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla as core organisms for hydrolytic and fermentative stages in trophic relationships with terminal electron acceptors from the methaneproducing Methanosarcina genus. Economic projections established that the cost-effective operational enhancements were sustainable for valorisation from grape marc by existing wineries and distilleries."
"Environmental management accounting in the Middle East and North Africa region: Significance of resource slack and coercive isomorphism Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is suffering from serious environmental issues, which are caused mainly by industrial and non-financial business activities. Implementing environmental management accounting (EMA) will help businesses manage environmental issues better and improve how they treat the environment. The key motivation for undertaking this study is that earlier research reported a poor level of environmental accounting practices by firms in the MENA region. These studies documented the necessity to develop a better understanding of EMA practices and the factors that influence their employment. Based on the new institutional sociology (NIS) perspective of institutional theory and resource slack theory, this study examines the influence of technological capabilities, environment-focused human resources management (EFHRM) and institutional isomorphism, specifically on the extent to which EMA practices are implemented in non-financial listed firms from eight MENA countries. These countries are Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan and Egypt. A web-based survey approach was utilised; and the data was analysed through structural equation modelling (SEM). The findings indicated an overall poor widespread of the use of EMA practices in the selected firms as perceived by the participants. Also, the findings suggest that technological capabilities, EFHRM and coercive isomorphism positively and significantly influence how EMA practices are implemented. Coercive pressures, technological and human resources are affecting the extent of EMA use in this study's sample, but not to a great extent. Hence, coercive pressures should be maximised by regulatory bodies in the selected MENA countries in order for EMA practices to be widely accepted. Furthermore, governments should facilitate the outsourcing of experts who can help with implementing EMA practices. It means collaborating with non-government partners, such as accounting associations, industry associations, research & consulting firms and educational institutions. These kinds of collaborations can lead to better support for environmental management and EMA, thus instituting the required educational programs and training to enhance employeesâ€™ awareness of EMA practices that include the role of technology."
"The Role of Biochar in Sustainable Agriculture, and Climate Change Mitigation for Sustainable Cities Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Sustainable development is facing a transformation. One solution finding its place as a key strategy in a number of sustainable development goal areas is biochar. Biochar is a geo-engineered bi-product that is similar in appearance to charcoal which differs from charcoal in that the organic biomass waste from which it is created is heated in an enclosed chamber to low temperatures and deprived of oxygen. This paper investigates the latest studies in crop productivity, commercial viabilities, and the socio-economic options of biochar production at a local and international level in the pursuit of sustainability and climate change mitigation. In terms of sustainability the uptake of biochar as a model for sustainable agriculture is steadily gaining momentum due to its agronomic potential for crop yields, organic soil carbon, carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The economic viability of biochar production varies markedly around the world. The most promising opportunities for soil carbon sequestration have derived from voluntary carbon markets and government initiatives such as Australiaâ€™s Emissions Reduction Fund. The scheme promoted the integration of biochar in land use management practices at a farm scale. If biochar is to have a more profound impact on a global scale, then countries need to adopt a sustainable biochar strategy which is universal along with standardised sustainability protocols."
"Marriage Equality: Two Generations of Gender and Sexually Diverse Australians Sexuality; Queering; Gay Tourism Marriage equality is routinely located as evidencing a domestic, non-radical or neoliberal approach to sexual diversity. This article questions such assumptions by highlighting the reflexive approach to the utility of marriage and the significant diversity of opinion and attitudes towards marriage equality among gender- and sexually-diverse Australians. It does so by drawing on a major study of two social generations of gender- and sexually-diverse Australiansâ€™ conducted in the lead-up to a controversial postal survey on same-sex marriage in 2017. In the survey many participants discussed their views on marriage equality, its benefits, and how they saw its relationship or relevance to their own lives. This article identifies four themes present in participantsâ€™ responses: (1) the personal and domestic importance of marriage equality to some participants; (2) the social and political affordances of marriage equality for LGBTQ+ persons in Australia more generally; (3) the apparently unremarkable status of marriage equality for some participants; and (4) continuing deep ambivalence about marriage equality for others."
"Electrospun Composite Nanofiltration Membranes for Arsenic Removal Polyethersulfone; Membrane; Ultrafiltration In recent years, significant attention has been paid towards the study and application of mixed matrix nanofibrous membranes for water treatment. The focus of this study is to de-velop and characterize functional polysulfone (PSf)-based composite nanofiltration (NF) membranes comprising two different oxides, such as graphene oxide (GO) and zinc oxide (ZnO) for arsenic removal from water. PSf/GO-and PSf/ZnO-mixed matrix NF membranes were fabricated using the electrospinning technique, and subsequently examined for their physicochemical properties and evaluated for their performance for arseniteâ€“As(III) and arsenateâ€“As(V) rejection. The effect of GO and ZnO on the morphology, hierarchical structure, and hydrophilicity of fabricated membranes was studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), small and ultra-small angle neutron scattering (USANS and SANS), contact angle, zeta potential, and BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) surface area analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to study the elemental compositions and polymer-oxide interaction in the membranes. The incorporation of GO and ZnO in PSf matrix reduced the fiber diameter but increased the porosity, hydrophilicity, and surface negative charge of the membranes. Among five membrane systems, PSf with 1% ZnO has the highest water permeability of 13, 13 and 11 L hâˆ’1 mâˆ’2 barâˆ’1 for pure water, As(III), and As(V)-contaminated water, respectively. The composite NF membranes of PSf and ZnO exhibited enhanced (more than twice) arsenite removal (at 5 bar pressure) of 71% as compared to pristine PSf membranes, at 43%, whereas both membranes showed only a 27% removal for arsenate."
"ORGANISATIONAL JUSTICE and MANAGING WORKPLACE INNOVATION: HOW IMPORTANT ARE FORMAL PROCEDURES? Personnel; Civic Virtue; Transformational Leadership Few studies examine organisational justice and innovation simultaneously within workplace settings. Thus, the purpose of our study was to investigate the impact of organisational justice on workplace innovation. We tested the three dimensions of organisational justice (distributive, procedural and interactional) and the four dimensions of workplace innovation (individual, team, organisational and overall climate for innovation) across multiple industry contexts. The sample comprised 282 individuals employed in a variety of industries based in the United States. The Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis identified a significant finding where organisational justice formal procedures promoted all four dimensions of workplace innovation and thus was important in managing workplace innovation. Distributive justice only had an impact on organisational innovation, while interactional procedures justice only had an impact on innovation climate and thus were less important. The study results provide new contributions to the innovation literature."
"Adverse shocks, household expenditure and child marriage: evidence from India and Vietnam Early Marriage; Legal Age; Africa South Of The Sahara Child marriage is associated with negative outcomes in regard to education, health and economic empowerment in later life. While the consequences of child marriage have been studied extensively, there has been limited discussion on the drivers of child marriage. This paper examines the impact of adverse shocks on child marriage. We use a sample of 886 girls between 12 and 18 years of age from India and Vietnam involved in the Young Lives project. The potential endogeneity problem is addressed by using rainfall deviation as the instrument. We find that in Vietnam, where bride price payment is a common practice in the event of expenditure reduction resulting from adverse shocks, a household may consider marrying off their daughter as a possible coping strategy. In contrast, in India where dowry payments are common, shocks may reduce the probability of child marriage, possibly, because a girlâ€™s family is unable to meet the dowry requirements. These findings are robust to alternative ways of measuring child marriage, expenditure and rainfall deviation. We recommend that policies designed to reduce child marriage are considered in the context of cultural and social norms."
"Natural organic matter removal and fouling resistance properties of a boron nitride nanosheet-functionalized thin film nanocomposite membrane and its impact on permeate chlorine demand Membrane; Ultrafiltration; Chemical Cleaning Nanofiltration (NF) is an attractive surface water treatment option for the enhanced removal of natural organic matter (NOM) to comply with the regulations of potentially toxic disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation. However, organic fouling has remained an unresolved issue which makes the process less cost-effective. To address this problem, the current study reports on the fabrication of a new thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membrane incorporated with and decorated by amine-functionalized boron nitride BN(NH2) nanosheets. Physicochemical investigations revealed 60 and 40 % enhancement in hydrophilicity and negative charge density of the modified membranes, respectively, which translated into 69 % improvement in flux as well as boosted NOM removal and fouling resistance compared with control counterparts. Additionally, the modified membranes exhibited a better filtration performance under detrimental solution chemistry conditions of low pH and high Ca2+ concentration. Liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) profiles and fluorescence excitation emission matrices (FEEM) demonstrated the capability of the modified membranes in removing humics and lower molecular-sized compounds from water as opposed to moderate removals achieved in a conventional water treatment plant. Finally, AQUASIM simulations showed the lower chlorine demand of the NF-treated water which can reflect on its decreased DBPs formation potential."
"Creating mixed communities through housing policies: Global perspectives Neighborhood Effects; Public Housing; Poverty This introductory review essay examines some of the key concepts and approaches framing the ongoing debate around mixed communities and housing regeneration policies around the world. This review summarizes past positive and negative side effects of social mix reported in the extant international literature. It then describes social mix housing policies in the Global East and the Global South, including China, Japan, South Korea, sub-Saharan Africa, and Singapore. In moving forward, the review essay adopts Galster and Friedrichsâ€™s challenge to think about the progressive reformation of a â€œsocial mix version 2.0â€â€”what it might look like, and what the policy implications of such an improved version of social mix might be. Three policy implications are discussed: intentionality of social mix; mixed-income housing transit-oriented design; and learning from the Global East and Global South."
"Sustainable food waste management model for Bangladesh Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste Excessive food waste (nearly 1.3 billion tons per annum) has exacerbated the world hunger crisis. This comprehensive review focuses on the food waste scenario, adverse effects, food waste management, existing waste management policies, and regulations in Bangladesh. Municipalities and urban centers generate 3.78 million tons of waste each year (15.96% of total food waste). This study utilized the national database to analyze food waste generation and projected growth by the year 2050. Yearly an estimated 17215.2 thousand acres of land and a significant amount of natural resources (water, energy) are being used to produce 23691.15 thousand tons of wasted food (45% of total food production). This study critically analyzed the waste management policy gap of Bangladesh and clearly identified each stage of the food loss production supply chain. The study assessed that yearly 481.6 MW energy could be generated from food waste. Focusing on effective policy and sustainability, a national food waste management model has been proposed for Bangladesh in compliance with sustainable development goals 12.3.1 global food loss. Food accumulates 16.7% to 20% of the world economy; therefore, any measures taken to reduce the food waste will be economically beneficial and environmentally sustainable."
"The association of mandatory tax disclosures with the readability and tone of voluntary tax reports Financial Markets; Stock Market; Sentiment Analysis This article examines companies with low comparative tax payable (public exposure â€“ scrutinised), compared to companies with higher comparative tax payable (public exposure â€“ low scrutiny) according to mandatory tax reports (MTRs), for differences in readability and tone in their respective voluntary tax reports (VTRs). In doing so, the authors posit three key opportunities for companies to control the tax narrative through tone and readability: (1) lack of available tax information; (2) lack of alignment between the accounting and taxation systems; and (3) latitude available in voluntary disclosures. The analysis reveals overall that a high (low) effective tax rate is associated with a more (less) readable VTR and a VTR with a more positive (negative) tone. When the companies are segregated, it is noted that public exposure â€“ scrutinised companies are found to resort to the tone in tax reporting, whereas those with lower scrutiny rely on the readability of reports."
"The social practices of hosting P2P social dining events: insights for sustainable tourism Platforms; Collaborative Consumption; Peer to Peer In many ways, the expansion of commercial for-profit, P2P social dining platforms has mirrored those within mobility and accommodation sectors. However its dynamics and impacts have received less consideration to date, with a notable paucity of attention to the hosts of social dining events. The aim of this paper is to address this research lacuna. Through its exploration of the social dining platforms VizEat in Athens and Eatwith in Barcelona, this paper identifies, analyses and compares the social practices of hosts around their social dining events in two key tourist destinations in Europe. Data is gathered through multiple methods from participating in and observing social dining events in each city to interviews with key stakeholders in the P2P social dining process (such as hosts, platform employees and ambassadors). The research reveals how dynamic rules, tools, skills and understandings shape and reshape the performance of hosting social dining events. It exposes tensions and ongoing negotiations between hosts and guests regarding matters of authenticity and privacy, an uneven risk burden between hosts and platforms with regards liability and scant regard for matters of sustainability. As a result there is little alignment between P2P social dining and the goals of sustainable tourism."
"Political connections and post-disaster assistance in rural Vietnam Vietnam; Wildcat Strike; Urbanization Political connections have been shown to lead to corruption, favouritism and the pursuit of self-interests. They can therefore serve as an impediment to development and poverty reduction. This study examines whether having political connections is associated with post-disaster support from government authorities in the case of Vietnam. Using commune level data for the period 2012 to 2014 and a number of alternative econometric specifications, it finds that communes with higher levels of connections at the district level have a higher probability of receiving support in a post-shock period. The type of political connections is found to be important. We find a strong impact of political connections when household members are officials themselves or when households have relatives as officials. Having friends as officials does not appear to impact the likelihood of receiving assistance. The impacts are also greater when households have siblings, offspring or cousins working in government, but no evidence is found when officials are parents. Finally, having connections with district leaders is more important than connections with district officials."
"Review of the interactions between vehicular emitted potentially toxic elements, roadside soils, and associated biota Risk Assessment; Source Apportionment; Soil Parent Materials Given the large size of the world road network, the land area affected by vehicular emissions is extensive. This review provides the first global picture of the relationships between vehicular emitted potentially toxic elements, roadside soils, and risks to associated biota. The following potentially toxic elements that accumulate in roadside soils have been examined in this review: As, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt, Rh, Se, Sb, Sn, Sr, Ti and Zn. The meta-analysis undertaken demonstrated an increase in concentrations of Cd, Pb, Zn, Pt, Pd and Rh in roadside soils compared to the mean global crustal concentrations. Positive correlations between potentially toxic element concentrations in roadside soil, plants, microbes, and animals were observed. Roadside studies have found increased potentially toxic element concentrations in plants and animals with increasing proximity to roads. The mean concentrations of Pb in roadside plants and vertebrates were at values above the World Health Organisation guidelines. Research has shown a range of impacts of potentially toxic elements in roadside soils on microbial activity including decreased litter decomposition, nitrogen fixation, nutrient cycling and enzyme synthesis. However, aside from the impact on microbial communities, there has been little research investigating the impacts of roadside soil elements on the associated biota. Thus, there is a need for research that investigates the toxicity of elements in roadside soils to plants and animals and to investigate the transfer of roadside elements through the food chain, and thus, risks posed to human health and the environment."
"Legitimacy theory: Despite its enduring popularity and contribution, time is right for a necessary makeover Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to reflect upon the contributions made to the social and environmental accounting literature by papers that comprised a 2002 Special Issue of Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal (AAAJ) entitled social and environmental reporting and its role in maintaining or creating organisational legitimacy. This paper will also provide insights into the origins of legitimacy theory as used in the social and environmental accounting literature as well as providing reflections about the strengths, and shortcomings, of the theory. Suggestions are made with respect to the ongoing application, and development, of legitimacy theory. Design/methodology/approach: As a commentary, this paper utilises a review of the social and environmental accounting and institutional literature across a number of decades to reveal insights about the development and use of legitimacy theory as a basis to explain social and environmental reporting practices. Citation data are also used to indicate the potential impact that the papers in the 2002 Special Issue had upon subsequent research. Findings: This commentary shows that the 2002 Special Issue is the most highly cited issue in the history of AAAJ. It also shows that individually, some of the papers in the Special Issue represent some of the most highly cited papers in the social and environmental accounting literature. The commentary provides arguments to suggest that the development of legitimacy theory is in need of further refinement, and suggests a way in which this refinement might take place. Research limitations/implications: This paper is largely based on the opinions of one researcher, and the evidence presented in the paper is selected on the basis that it is deemed sufficient to support the opinions being projected. The paper also relies on citation data as an indicator of â€œimpactâ€. The implication of the research is that it identifies a â€œway forwardâ€ for the development of theory applicable to the understanding of organisational social and environmental reporting practices. Originality/value: The study provides evidence to show that the 2002 Special Issue was significant within the context of AAAJ, and also within the context of the evolution of the social and environmental accounting literature. The description of the history of the development of legitimacy theory, and of the theoryâ€™s subsequent application, provides a solid impetus for future refinements to the theory."
"Naming Rights? Analysing Child Surname Disputes in Australian Courts Through a Gendered Lens Naming; English Names; Naming Practices Despite major advances in gender equality, patrilineal namingâ€”children being granted their fatherâ€™s surnameâ€”persists as a largely unquestioned norm in those Western countries with predominantly Anglo traditions, even in families where mothers retain their birth names. In Australia, when parents cannot agree on the childâ€™s surname, the issue will go to a court or tribunal, to be decided by a judicial decision-maker. Apart from Jonathan Herringâ€™s (2009) work in the UK, such cases have been little examined by scholars. This paper explores the question of whether child surnames chosen by Australian courtsâ€”a supposedly neutral and objective third partyâ€”uphold patriarchal logic or provide more equitable outcomes. Using a feminist critical discourse framework, we examine five recent court judgments about child surname disputes, and six news articles about these types of cases. While these cases are not a representative sample, we find that, despite the existence of specific legal principles relating to childrenâ€™s surnames, decision-makersâ€™ judgments were inconsistent and subjective. Furthermore, mothersâ€™ names tended to be granted to children when fathers were deemed to be â€˜bad dads.â€™"
"Individual Smad2 linker region phosphorylation sites determine the expression of proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesizing genes Low Density Lipoprotein; Proteoglycan; Atherogenesis Growth factors such as thrombin and transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î² facilitate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain hyperelongation on proteoglycans, a phenomenon that increases lipoprotein binding in the vessel wall and the development of atherosclerosis. TGF-Î² signals via canonical carboxy terminal phosphorylation of R-Smads and also non-canonical linker region phosphorylation of R-Smads. The G protein coupled receptor agonist, thrombin, can transactivate the TGF-Î² receptor leading to both canonical and non-canonical Smad signalling. Linker region phosphorylation drives the expression of genes for the synthesis of the proteoglycan, biglycan. Proteoglycan synthesis involves core protein synthesis, the initiation of GAG chains and the subsequent elongation of GAG chains. We have explored the relationship between the thrombin stimulated phosphorylation of individual serine and threonine sites in the linker region of Smad2 and the expression of GAG initiation xylosyltransferase-1 (XT-1) and GAG elongation chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase-1 (C4ST-1) and chondroitin synthase-1 (CHSY-1) genes. Thrombin stimulated the phosphorylation of all four target residues (Thr220, Ser245, Ser250 and Ser255 residues) with a similar temporal pattern â€“ phosphorylation was maximal at 15 min (the earliest time point studied) and the level of the phospho-proteins declined thereafter over the following 4 h. Jnk, p38 and PI3K, selectively mediated the phosphorylation of the Thr220 residue whereas the serine residues were variously phosphorylated by multiple kinases. Thrombin stimulated the expression of all three genes â€“ XT-1, C4ST-1 and CHSY-1. The three pathways mediating Thr220 phosphorylation were also involved in the expression of XT-1. The target pathways (excluding Jnk) were involved in the expression of the GAG elongation genes (C4ST-1 and CHSY-1). These findings support the contention that individual Smad linker region phosphorylation sites are linked to the expression of genes for the initiation and elongation of GAG chains on proteoglycans. The context of this work is that a specific inhibitor of GAG elongation represents a potential therapeutic agent for preventing GAG elongation and lipid binding and the results indicate that the specificity of the pathways is such that it might be therapeutically feasible to specifically target GAG elongation without interfering with other physiological processes with which proteoglycans are involved."
"Literature review on the impact of welfare policy design on children and youth Child Care; Early Childhood Education and Care; School Readiness We review the empirical literature on the causal effects of welfare-to-work policies on the employment of low-income parents and the intergenerational impacts on their children. We focus on welfare policies that change benefit levels, activity requirements, time limits, and in-work benefits. These policies may affect children through several mechanisms, including changes in family income, time spent with parents, and attitudes towards work or welfare. To unpack these mechanisms and understand the net effects of these policies, we assess how the impact on children varies across outcomes, home environments and institutional settings. Overall, the literature shows that income tax credits are an attractive policy, simultaneously increasing employment and improving child development outcomes. In contrast, other policies that boost employment either have no or negative impacts on child development."
"Anti-tumor effects of vitamin B2, B6 and B9 in promonocytic lymphoma cells Folic Acid; Methionine Synthase Reductase; Meta-Analysis Chronic inflammation can lead to tumour initiation and progression. Vitamin B complex has the ability to regulate the immune response and, therefore, inflammation but many of the mechanistic and molecular processes involved in this regulation are still not fully understood. This study sought to determine some of these processes by studying the effects of vitamin B2 (riboflavin) B6 (pyridoxine) and B9 (folic acid) on un-differentiated pro-monocytic lymphoma cells in regard to their ability to alter the proliferation, migration, apoptosis, cytokines and expression levels of programmed death ligand 1. We show that vitamin B2, B6 and B9, on pro-monocytic lymphoma cells exerted an anti-tumorigenic effect. This data could form the basis for future studies in using vitamin B supplementation to reduce cancer cell growth in vivo."
"Advances in transcriptomics of plants Argonaute Proteins; Gene; Nicotiana Benthamiana The current global population of 7.3 billion is estimated to reach 9.7 billion in the year 2050. Rapid population growth is driving up global food demand. Additionally, global climate change, environmental degradation, drought, emerging diseases, and salty soils are the current threats to global food security. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of these diverse agricultural productivity constraints and enhance crop yield and stress-tolerance in plants, we need to go beyond traditional and molecular plant breeding. The powerful new tools for genome editing, Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) and Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas systems (CRISPR-Cas9), have been hailed as a quantum leap forward in the development of stress-resistant plants. Plant breeding techniques, however, have several drawbacks. Hence, identification of transcriptional regulatory elements and deciphering mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation are crucial to avoiding unintended consequences in modified crop plants, which could ultimately have negative impacts on human health. RNA splicing as an essential regulated post-transcriptional process, alternative polyadenylation as an RNA-processing mechanism, along with non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, small interfering RNAs and long non-coding RNAs) have been identified as major players in gene regulation. In this chapter, we highlight new findings on the essential roles of alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation in plant development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. We also discuss biogenesis and the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants and recent advances in our knowledge of the roles of miRNAs and siRNAs in plant stress response."
"The rise of ‘smart’ solutions in Africa: a review of the socio-environmental cost of the transportation and employment benefits of ride-hailing technology in Ghana Ghana; Urban Planning; Resource Curse Governments in Africa are licensing major global ride-hailing firms to launch operations in the continent. This is often presented as a refreshing development for the continent to leverage technology to address its twin problems of inefficient urban transport and rising youth unemployment. Interviews with ride-hailing adopters (drivers, riders, and car owners) and researchers in Ghana suggest, however, that whereas the technology is driving up the standards of road transport experience, the benefits are accessible to a select few (largely, the younger, highly educated and relatively high income-earning class). The lopsided power relations underlying the ride-hailing industry have also meant that the economic opportunities it avails disproportionately benefit a few powerful players (e.g. ride-hailing firms and car owners) while stimulating â€˜turf warsâ€™ among online and traditional taxi drivers; deepening existing gender inequalities in access to income-earning opportunities in the commercial passenger transport sector; encouraging unhealthy driving practices, shifts from shared public transport, and inundation of the roads with more private cars. While it will be imprecise to say that the private gains of ride-hailing outstrip the public costs and, therefore, the technology is detrimental to Ghanaâ€™s development, the considered evidence raises the need for sustained scrutiny of the hailing of technological interventions as though they are the magic bullets for socio-economic transformation in Africa. Overall, the paper argues that dismantling the power structures underlying Africaâ€™s urban challenges will require more than splashing â€˜smartâ€™ apps and other tech wizardries around. Indeed, the lessons from Ghanaâ€™s ride-hailing industry suggest that such exclusively technical solutions could easily take root and pattern after existing strictures of unjust power structures in ways that could exacerbate the social and environmental problems they are supposed to address."
"Intranasal and epicutaneous administration of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonists provides protection against influenza A virus-induced morbidity in mice Influenza A Virus; Orthomyxoviridae; Human Influenza Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes viral RNA following endocytosis of the virus and initiates a powerful immune response characterized by Type I IFN production and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Despite this immune response, the virus causes very significant pathology, which may be inflammation-dependent. In the present study, we examined the effect of intranasal delivery of the TLR7 agonist, imiquimod or its topical formulation Aldara, on the inflammation and pathogenesis caused by IAV infection. In mice, daily intranasal delivery of imiquimod prevented peak viral replication, bodyweight loss, airway and pulmonary inflammation, and lung neutrophils. Imiquimod treatment also resulted in a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory neutrophil chemotactic cytokines and prevented the increase in viral-induced lung dysfunction. Various antibody isotypes (IgG1, IgG2a, total IgG, IgE and IgM), which were increased in the BALF following influenza A virus infection, were further increased with imiquimod. While epicutaneous application of Aldara had a significant effect on body weight, it did not reduce neutrophil and eosinophil airway infiltration; indicating less effective drug delivery for this formulation. We concluded that intranasal imiquimod facilitates a more effective immune response, which can limit the pathology associated with influenza A virus infection."
"Criminal record checking and employment: The importance of policy and proximity Criminal Record; Hiring Decisions; Applicant Employment is essential to the rehabilitation of offenders, yet employers routinely check criminal records and rely on them to deny offenders employment. To manage these practices many jurisdictions use spent conviction and anti-discrimination schemes; there have also been recent campaigns aimed at â€˜banning the boxâ€™, requiring that questions about criminal record are deferred to a later point when the person could address them in interview. This article draws on findings from surveys and interviews with human resources personnel about their criminal record checking practices to identify some key concerns of employers and highlight areas for challenging employer practices. The study highlights the influence on employment decisions of external factors â€“ legislation, government policy and industry regulation â€“ and of internal considerations about proximity of the decision maker to the applicant and potential proximity to other staff. The willingness of some employers to engage with applicants opens up the possibilities for people with a criminal record to demonstrate their readiness to desist from offending and to counter stereotypes about offenders. Where there is no scope for, or willingness to attempt, such discretionary engagement, however, it is likely that employers will prioritize a risk-averse approach to employment, pre-emptively excluding potentially productive employees, and putting such ex-offenders at risk of deeper exclusion."
"Global, regional, and national age-sex-specific mortality and life expectancy, 1950-2017: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 National Burden; Territories; Disease Background: Assessments of age-specifc mortality and life expectancy have been done by the UN Population Division, Department of Economics and Social Afairs (UNPOP), the United States Census Bureau, WHO, and as part of previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD). Previous iterations of the GBD used population estimates from UNPOP, which were not derived in a way that was internally consistent with the estimates of the numbers of deaths in the GBD. The present iteration of the GBD, GBD 2017, improves on previous assessments and provides timely estimates of the mortality experience of populations globally. Methods: The GBD uses all available data to produce estimates of mortality rates between 1950 and 2017 for 23 age groups, both sexes, and 918 locations, including 195 countries and territories and subnational locations for 16 countries. Data used include vital registration systems, sample registration systems, household surveys (complete birth histories, summary birth histories, sibling histories), censuses (summary birth histories, household deaths), and Demographic Surveillance Sites. In total, this analysis used 8259 data sources. Estimates of the probability of death between birth and the age of 5 years and between ages 15 and 60 years are generated and then input into a model life table system to produce complete life tables for all locations and years. Fatal discontinuities and mortality due to HIV/AIDS are analysed separately and then incorporated into the estimation. We analyse the relationship between age-specifc mortality and development status using the Socio-demographic Index, a composite measure based on fertility under the age of 25 years, education, and income. There are four main methodological improvements in GBD 2017 compared with GBD 2016: 622 additional data sources have been incorporated; new estimates of population, generated by the GBD study, are used; statistical methods used in diferent components of the analysis have been further standardised and improved; and the analysis has been extended backwards in time by two decades to start in 1950. Findings: Globally, 18Â·7% (95% uncertainty interval 18Â·4-19Â·0) of deaths were registered in 1950 and that proportion has been steadily increasing since, with 58Â·8% (58Â·2-59Â·3) of all deaths being registered in 2015. At the global level, between 1950 and 2017, life expectancy increased from 48Â·1 years (46Â·5-49Â·6) to 70Â·5 years (70Â·1-70Â·8) for men and from 52Â·9 years (51Â·7-54Â·0) to 75Â·6 years (75Â·3-75Â·9) for women. Despite this overall progress, there remains substantial variation in life expectancy at birth in 2017, which ranges from 49Â·1 years (46Â·5-51Â·7) for men in the Central African Republic to 87Â·6 years (86Â·9-88Â·1) among women in Singapore. The greatest progress across age groups was for children younger than 5 years; under-5 mortality dropped from 216Â·0 deaths (196Â·3-238Â·1) per 1000 livebirths in 1950 to 38Â·9 deaths (35Â·6-42Â·83) per 1000 livebirths in 2017, with huge reductions across countries. Nevertheless, there were still 5Â·4 million (5Â·2-5Â·6) deaths among children younger than 5 years in the world in 2017. Progress has been less pronounced and more variable for adults, especially for adult males, who had stagnant or increasing mortality rates in several countries. The gap between male and female life expectancy between 1950 and 2017, while relatively stable at the global level, shows distinctive patterns across super-regions and has consistently been the largest in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, and smallest in south Asia. Performance was also variable across countries and time in observed mortality rates compared with those expected on the basis of development. Interpretation: This analysis of age-sex-specifc mortality shows that there are remarkably complex patterns in population mortality across countries. The fndings of this study highlight global successes, such as the large decline in under-5 mortality, which refects signifcant local, national, and global commitment and investment over several decades. However, they also bring attention to mortality patterns that are a cause for concern, particularly among adult men and, to a lesser extent, women, whose mortality rates have stagnated in many countries over the time period of this study, and in some cases are increasing."
"Nanobody-displaying porous silicon nanoparticles for the co-delivery of siRNA and doxorubicin Drug Delivery Systems; Theranostic Nanomedicine; Hydrosilylation Targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics to cancer cells has the potential to yield high drug concentrations in cancer cells while minimizing any unwanted side effects. However, the development of multidrug resistance in cancer cells may impede the accumulation of chemotherapy drugs within these, decreasing its therapeutic efficacy. Downregulation of multidrug resistance-related proteins such as MRP1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a promising approach in the reversal of drug resistance. The co-delivery of doxorubicin (Dox) and siRNA against MRP1 (siMRP1) by using nanoparticles comprised of biocompatible porous silicon (pSi) presents itself as a novel opportunity to utilize the biomaterial's high loading capacity and large accessible surface area. Additionally, to increase the selectivity and retention of the delivery vehicle at the tumor site, nanobodies were incorporated onto the nanoparticle surface via a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker directed towards either the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). The nanobody-displaying pSi nanoparticles (pSiNPs) demonstrated effective gene silencing, inhibiting MRP1 expression by 74 Â± 6% and 74 Â± 4% when incubated with EGFR-pSiNPs and PSMA-pSiNPs, respectively, in prostate cancer cells. The downregulation of MRP1 led to a further increase in cytotoxicity when both siRNA and Dox were delivered in conjunction in both cancer cell monocultures and spheroids when compared to free Dox or Dox and a scrambled sequence of siRNA. Altogether, nanobody-displaying pSiNPs are an effective carrier for the dual delivery of both siRNA and Dox for cancer treatment."
"Active transport research priorities for Australia Bicycling; Bike; Cyclist Background: To advance active transport, robust policy-relevant evidence is needed to understand how to change behaviour and to support decision-making by policy makers and practitioners. Currently, however, priority research questions that are most critical for advancing active transport have not been identified. To this end, we aimed to inform an active transport research priority agenda for Australia to guide research, funding, policy making and practice to enhance active transport. Methods: We designed and conducted a novel priority setting exercise to identify and set research priorities for the advancement of active transport in Australia. The process consisted of three phases: 1) generation and collection of research questions from a diverse reference group consisting of experts and key members representing academia, government, private and not-for-profit organisations (n = 259 respondents); 2) thematic analysis and consolidation of research questions to a final list of 50 questions; and 3) prioritisation of research questions by the reference group (n = 140 respondents). Results: The top ranked questions included the evidence to support policy changes to increase active transport, identifying and overcoming community resistance to active transport infrastructure, road space re-allocation and lower urban speed limits, evidence on the needs of children, enhanced governance and funding, and improving how the benefits of active transport are best measured and communicated. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first priority setting exercise in active transport globally. The identified research priorities can be used to identify new policy-relevant areas of research, contribute to the active transport research agenda in Australia and guide research funding. Focusing on these research priorities will address stakeholder and academic priorities and provide the evidence required to support the advancement of active transport in Australia. Future research could use the same approach to identify research priorities in other countries."
"Associations between public transport accessibility around homes and schools and walking and cycling among adolescents Report Cards; Mode Choice; Built Environment Good public transport accessibility is associated with active travel, but this is under-researched among adolescents. We tested associations between public transport accessibility and active travel among school-going adolescents (12â€“18 years; n = 1329) from Melbourne, Australia analysing Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity data. Outcomes included main mode of transport to school and accumulating â‰¥20 min of active travel over the day. Low and high compared to no public transport accessibility around homes were associated with higher odds of public transport use (low (odds ratio (OR): 1.94 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28, 2.94) high (OR: 2.86 95% CI: 1.80, 4.53)). Low and high public transport accessibility around homes were also associated with higher prevalence of achieving â‰¥20 min of active travel (low (prevalence ratio (PR): 1.14 95% CI: 0.97, 1.34) high (PR: 1.31 95% CI: 1.11, 1.54)) compared to none. Public transport accessibility around schools was associated with public transport use (low (OR: 2.13 95% CI: 1.40, 3.24) high (OR: 5.07 95% CI: 3.35, 7.67)) and achieving â‰¥20 min of active travel (low (PR: 1.18 95% CI: 1.00, 1.38) high (PR: 1.64 95% CI: 1.41, 1.90)). Positive associations were confirmed between public transport accessibility and both outcomes of active travel."
"Insights into business strategies for reducing food waste in the Australian food industry Business Model Innovation; Innovation; Digital Transformation A significant amount of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted worldwide. To prevent and reduce food waste, the food industry needs a productive and profitable approach. Such approaches often entail businesses making decisions that utilise and integrate sustainability tools. Integrating tools into businesses can inform their sustainability strategies and activities. This sustainability-driven opportunity indicates a need to gain insights into business strategies for reducing food waste and the tools used to do so. The current study reviews these strategies and tools by examining publicly available Australian food industry documents. Based on an analysis of secondary sources, this review identified 40 food businesses and revealed their various strategies for reducing food waste. The review found that several businesses use various strategies to reduce food waste, including sustainable farming, diverting waste from landfills and donating unsold food. However, preventative strategies for surplus food creation have received less attention in addressing the causes of food waste. Interestingly, little published information on the tools contributing to more sustainable food production. The review's findings can provide practical implications and guidelines through a more nuanced understanding of food waste strategies. The conclusion also explains the study's limitations and suggests further research areas."
"Impact of additive manufacturing on the Vietnamese transportation industry: An exploratory study 3D Printers; Spare Parts; Supply Chain International firmsâ€™ activities and structures have become highly complex as a result of managing a vast network of entities located around the world. Complex technology such as Additive Manufacturing or generally accepted as 3D printing has received universal interest. Economic growth in Vietnam generates unique infrastructure, logistics services and transportation challenges and opportunities. Logistics are a critically important priority in international trade, foremost in ongoing regional economic expansion. The main objective of this paper is to examine the impact and benefits of advanced technology, affecting logistics services and transportation in Vietnam. This research applied a descriptive survey methodology to gather primary empirical data on the awareness and the willingness to adapt to the technology of organizations focusing on opportunities for the Vietnam market. The results indicated that organizations have a positive attitude towards 3DP impact. The stronger influence was discovered on customization, new customer value proposition, the competitive advantage, and transportation and storage cost reduction. Vietnam is currently one of the most attractive emerging markets in the world. The findings from this research provide timely and valuable new insights into this phenomenon, as a potential mechanism for assisting the revolution of the transportation industry towards improving traffic congestion and pollution."
"Online activism and redress for institutional child abuse: function and rhetoric in survivor advocacy group tweets Social Media; Organization-public Relationships; Strategic Communication In Australia, survivor advocacy groups have been closely engaged with the emergence and development of policy and redress responses to institutional child abuse. Their activities and influence in this respect have been under-researched. This study focuses on the use of Twitter, a tool increasingly employed by activist groups in their lobbying repertoires. Using content and thematic analysis, tweets of 15 non-survivor led advocacy groups, and one survivor-led organisationâ€”Care Leavers Australasia Network (CLAN)â€”referring to â€˜redressâ€™ were analysed for rhetorical content (via Aristotleâ€™s traditional framework of ethos, pathos, and logos) and communication purposes using three broad functional areas defined by Lovejoy and Saxton (2012). In keeping with Lovejoy and Saxtonâ€™s (2012) framework, the results found that for both non-survivor led advocacy groups and CLAN the primary function of their use of Twitter was to convey information to audiences. However, the integrated use of the rhetoric framework with the function framework revealed markedly different lobbying styles between the non-survivor led advocacy groups and CLAN with the latter pursuing a more confrontational and direct style of lobbying in communications. CLAN also overwhelmingly pursued emotion-focussed rhetoric in lobbying communications."
"Biodiversity and ecosystem services in strategic environmental assessment: An evaluation of six Australian cases Decision Making; Social Impact Assessment; Environmental Impact Statements Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) aims to provide a sound theoretical basis on which to plan for biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES). With the multi-purpose and increasing use of SEA worldwide, it is timely to evaluate the effectiveness of SEA practice in integrating biodiversity and ES considerations. Here, we derive criteria from the International Best Practice Principles on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in Impact Assessment to evaluate six Australian SEAs conducted for urban development plans. We use qualitative and quantitative content analysis to examine the endorsed SEA reports. We identify and analyse text references related to the evaluation criteria and use word counting of keywords to supplement and cross-check the validity of our findings. Four significant results emerge from our analysis. First, while goals to achieve no net loss (NNL) or net gain outcomes for biodiversity are mentioned in all case studies, their poor specification may limit their effectiveness. Second, there is limited integration of ES considerations into the SEA reports, limiting the potential advantages that such an approach could provide. Third, offsetting is the most documented type of mitigation measure, potentially signalling a lack of evidence in implementing early steps of the mitigation hierarchy, including avoidance. This could be explained by the low level of integration of biodiversity and ES considerations from the early stages in the planning process, where there is more flexibility to apply such steps. Fourth, biodiversity management systems and follow-up activities lack detailed information to judge whether they will be useful to demonstrate NNL outcomes. Based on these findings, we present recommendations for enhancing the integration of biodiversity and ES considerations in SEAs. Our approach provides a general framework that can be applied to evaluate SEAs elsewhere in the world from a biodiversity and ES conservation perspective."
"Australian universities in a pandemic world: transforming a broken business model? Accounting History; Double-Entry Bookkeeping; Social Responsibility Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to critique the accounting and financial orientation of Australian universitiesâ€™ business model to identify the future university financial management and accounting role in universitiesâ€™ strategic trajectory responding to COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: Informed by Habermasian perspectives on change, it uses published research into university commercialisation and media commentaries on COVID-19 impacts. Findings: Australian universities have aggressively pursued an accounting-based private sector business model. Their revenue generating reliance on international student revenues has been undermined by the COVIS-19 crisis. Nonetheless, university management clings to their commercialised university identity and role colonised by the accounting structures. Fundamental change requires a reversal of this relationship. Research limitations/implications: Future research must observe and evaluate university strategic crisis reactions and their impacts on national and societal well-being with a view to identifying alternative futures. Practical implications: Universities face decisions concerning their ongoing role in society and their future approach to balancing operational strategies and the accounting influence. Social implications: This study raises the issue of whether universities should continue being seen as an export industry supporting the national economy or as knowledge, educational and social resource for their national and regional communities. Originality/value: This paper integrates research into universities over several decades into a strategic critique of their current reaction to an unprecedented global pandemic."
"Re-examining technology's destruction of blue-collar work Wage Inequality; Wages; Skill Premium Despite research suggesting certain death of blue-collar work due to technological advancements, blue-collar jobs continue to be in demand. Through a study of the blue-collar dominant Transport and Logistics sector in Australia, we apply a Critical Realist framework to consider the tendencies contributing to, and limiting, technological uptake and worker displacement. Our analysis of interviews with sector managers demonstrate how technological uptake decisions to enact labour saving technologies are often constrained by other causal mechanisms and associated (counter) tendencies. Causal mechanisms related to geographical artifacts, industry structure and established business models, along with class structure, mitigate against â€˜big bangâ€™ technological transformation and the demise of blue-collar work. We conclude that tracking the future of work is important, but it cannot be done solely on the basis of technological capacities to displace labour or without consideration of the complex interplay of causal mechanisms and tendencies shaping employer decisions about technology."
"Relationality and Economic Empowerment: The Role of Men in Supporting and Undermining Women’s Pathways Papua New Guinea; Tok Pisin; Initiation Rituals Within development projects, empowerment is often construed in narrow terms, and increasingly in relation to economic empowerment. Feminist scholars have recently argued the need to bring back a more encompassing view of empowerment, which pays greater attention to relationality and changes in consciousness. In this article, we focus on one aspect of relationalityâ€“womenâ€™s relationships with men. Drawing on three case studies of womenâ€™s business success in Papua New Guinea, we argue men are pivotal in supporting and undermining womenâ€™s economic opportunities. Offering support to recent work on womenâ€™s empowerment which emphasizes both womenâ€™s relationships with men, and the specificity of contexts into account, our article contributes to current debates in gender and development."
"Building a sustainable society: Construction, public procurement policy and ‘best practice’ in the european union Anthropocene; Unequal Exchange; Posthumanism Sustainability and sustainable development are political and essentially contested social phenomena. Despite this ambiguity, they continue to hold a central position as apolitical concepts in much of social science and policy making. In Europe, public procurement is increasingly used as a tool to reach sustainability, a fact that actualizes an inherent tension between politically charged objectives on the one hand, and technological processes and market logics on the other. Therefore, in this article, we investigate this tension by studying policies relating to sustainable public procurement of the built environment in the EU. We argue that governing any policy domain entails the construction and representation of particular policy problems. Hence, we focus on how the â€˜problemsâ€™ of sustainable public procurement are represented in EU policy guidance and best practice documents. Our analysis shows that these central policy documents are dominated by a problem representation where unsustainability is constructed as technical design flaws and market failure. This has the primary effect that it renders sustainable development as, primarily, a technical issue, and beyond politics. Therefore, we conclude that current policy reproduces â€˜weakâ€™ forms of sustainable development, where the practice is depoliticized and premised upon continued growth and innovation."
"Exploring the Sequence Diversity of Cyclotides from Vietnamese Viola Species Cyclotides; Kalata B1; Cyclic Peptide Viola is the largest genus in the Violaceae plant family and is known for its ubiquitous natural production of cyclotides. Many Viola species are used as medicinal herbs across Asia and are often consumed by humans in teas for the treatment of diseases, including ulcers and asthma. Previous studies reported the isolation of cyclotides from Viola species in many countries in the hope of discovering novel compounds with anti-cancer activities; however, Viola species from Vietnam have not been investigated to date. Here, the discovery of cyclotides from three Viola species (V. arcuata, V. tonkinensis, and V. austrosinensis) collected in the northern mountainous region of Vietnam is reported. Ten cyclotides were isolated from these three Viola species: four are novel and six were previously reported to be expressed in other plants. The structures of three of the new bracelet cyclotides are similar to that of cycloviolacin O2. Because cycloviolacin O2 has previously been shown to have potent activity against a wide range of cancer cell lines including HeLa (human cervical cancer cells) and PC-3 (human prostate cancer cells), the cancer cytotoxicity of the cyclotides isolated from V. arcuata was assessed. All tested cyclotides were cytotoxic against cancer cells, albeit to varying degrees. The sequences discovered in this study significantly expand the understanding of cyclotide diversity, especially in comparison with other cyclotides found in plants from the Asian region."
"Distribution, nature and threats to soils of the Australian Alps: A review Tasmania; World Heritage; Wetlands The Australian Alps contain an assemblage of soil types that is unique on the Australian continent. The above-ground ecosystems of the Australian Alps have received considerable scientific attention but research relating to the nature of its soils has been much more limited. A fuller understanding of the role of soils in these ecosystems is required to inform effective management strategies. This review was undertaken to assess existing research on soils in the Australian Alps. We aimed to summarise our current knowledge of their nature, distribution and characteristics, to examine the services they provide and to assess their vulnerability to the range of threats that exist to the soil resource both local and external. Soils of higher elevations, namely Transitional Alpine Humus Soils, Alpine Humus Soils and upland Peat Soils are particularly important to the ecology, hydrology and potential carbon storage of the region, yet our understanding of the nature, formation and functioning of these soil types remains weak. A series of knowledge gaps and research priorities are identified, relating to basic knowledge needs on the formation, distribution and function of these soils, particularly their microbial populations and the impacts of specific threats (i.e. climate change, grazing, fire, visitors, infrastructure, feral animals and pollution)."
"Parking Availability Prediction with Long Short Term Memory Model Parking; Internet Of Things; Cruising Traffic congestion causes heavily energy consumption, carbon dioxide emission and air pollution in cities, which is usually created by cars searching on-street parking spaces. Drivers are likely to move slowly and waste time on the road for an available on-street parking space if parking slot availability information is not revealed in advanced. Therefore, it is necessary for city councils to provide a car parking availability prediction service which could inform car drivers vacant parking slots before they start the journey. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on recurrent network and use the long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict parking multi-steps ahead. The core idea of this framework is that both the occupancy rate of on-street parking in a specific region and car leaving probability are exploited as prediction performance metric. A large real parking dataset is used to evaluate the proposed approach with extensive comparative experiments. Experimental results shows the proposed model outperform the state-of-art model."
"Phytochemistry, ethnopharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of Cnidium monnieri (L.) cusson Osthole; Cnidium; Coumarin Derivative Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson (CMC) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that has been widely grown and used in Asia. It is also known as â€œShe chuang ziâ€ in China (Chinese:, â€œJashoshiâ€ in Japan, â€œSasangiaâ€ in Korea, and â€œXa sang tuâ€ in Vietnam. This study aimed to provide an up-to-date review of its phytochemistry, ethnopharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology. All available information on CMC was collected from the Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicines, PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and China Network Knowledge Infrastructure. The updated chemical structures of the compounds are those ones without chemical ID numbers or references from the previous review. A total of 429 chemical constituents have been elucidated and 56 chemical structures have been firstly identified in CMC with traceable evidence. They can be categorized as coumarins, volatile constituents, liposoluble compounds, chromones, monoterpenoid glucosides, terpenoids, glycosides, glucides, and other compounds. CMC has demonstrated impressive potential for the management of various diseases in extensive preclinical research. Since most of the studies are overly concentrated on osthole, more research is needed to investigate other chemical constituents."
"An assessment of airport sustainability: Part 3-water management at Copenhagen Airport Greywater; Laundries; Waste Water Sustainable water management is critical for airports as they consume substantial volumes of water to maintain their infrastructure and operations. Airports also generate large volumes of surface and waste waters. The aim of this study was to examine Copenhagen Airport's sustainable water management strategies and systems from 2006 to 2016. The study used a longitudinal qualitative research design. The annual water consumption at Copenhagen Airport has risen from 2006 to 2016 in line with the increased passenger volumes and aircraft movements. Drinking water is sourced from the Taarnby and DragÃ¸r municipal water works. Non-potable water is used wherever possible and is sourced from a local remedial drilling. Copenhagen Airport uses two separate sewer systems for handling surface and wastewater. These waters are not discharged to same system due to their different nature. To mitigate environmental risks and impacts on soil, water, and local communities; the quality of drinking, ground, and surface water are regularly monitored. The airport has implemented various water saving initiatives, such as, an aquifer thermal energy system, to reduce water consumption. The strategies, systems, and the water-saving initiatives have successfully underpinned Copenhagen Airport's sustainable water management."
"Digital criminology: Crime and justice in digital society Social Media; Election Campaigns; Political Communication The infusion of digital technology into contemporary society has had significant effects for everyday life and for everyday crimes. Digital Criminology: Crime and Justice in Digital Society is the first interdisciplinary scholarly investigation extending beyond traditional topics of cybercrime, policing and the law to consider the implications of digital society for public engagement with crime and justice movements. This book seeks to connect the disparate fields of criminology, sociology, legal studies, politics, media and cultural studies in the study of crime and justice. Drawing together intersecting conceptual frameworks, Digital Criminology examines conceptual, legal, political and cultural framings of crime, formal justice responses and informal citizen-led justice movements in our increasingly connected global and digital society. Building on case study examples from across Australia, Canada, Europe, China, the UK and the United States, Digital Criminology explores key questions including: What are the implications of an increasingly digital society for crime and justice? What effects will emergent technologies have for how we respond to crime and participate in crime debates? What will be the foundational shifts in criminological research and frameworks for understanding crime and justice in this technologically mediated context? What does it mean to be a â€˜justâ€™ digital citizen? How will digital communications and social networks enable new forms of justice and justice movements? Ultimately, the book advances the case for an emerging digital criminology: extending the practical and conceptual analyses of â€˜cyberâ€™ or â€˜eâ€™ crime beyond a focus foremost on the novelty, pathology and illegality of technology-enabled crimes, to understandings of online crime as inherently social."
"Event-Based Perceptual Quality Assessment for HTTP-Based Video Streaming with Playback Interruption Videorecording; Video Streaming; Adaptive Dynamics The popularity of HTTP-based video streaming services has been increasing in recent years. The quality of HTTP-based video streaming services is measured by the user's quality of experience (QoE). Perceptual quality (PQ), a strong indicator of the QoE, has been widely studied in the literature. Specifically, previous studies primarily focused on modeling the overall perceptual quality at the end of the viewing process. The specific influence of each event during the viewing process was neglected. Since the PQ is a function of time, which models the human perception of audiovisual services, this contribution focuses on investigating the time-varying feature of human perception. In this paper, the viewing timeline of subjects is divided into rebuffering and playback. An event-based perceptual quality assessment (EPQ) framework is introduced, which can assess the PQ of interrupted HTTP-based video streaming at any point in time. To understand the human perception of video streams with playback interruptions, a subjective quality assessment experiment was designed to obtain the PQ at a series of points in time. A between-subjects design was adopted in which each subject can view video content without repetition. Based on the experimental results, a PQ assessment model was proposed to predict the change in PQ (i.e., \Delta PQ) after each rebuffering and playback. The overall PQ at any point in time is calculated as the summation of the \DeltaPQs of all the previous events. The experimental results demonstrated that the EPQ-based model outperforms the rebuffering components contained in the ITU-T Rec. P.1201.1, P.1201 Amd. 2 and P.1203.3 in our database."
"Design of an energy efficient car by biomimicry of a boxfish Baseball; Ball; Tennis A boxfish has certain aero/hydrodynamic features in its body shape which makes it more efficient in traveling through the water using less energy. Because of the streamline features of the boxfish, it produces less drag for its movement. So, there is a lot of possibility to design a passenger car by implementing the aerodynamic features on the car shape for improving the energy efficiency. This paper investigates the aerodynamic behavior of a boxfish using both experimental and computational methods. A scaled-up model boxfish was manufactured, and passenger car model was also developed by applied certain aerodynamic features on the car shape and a prototype was manufactured. The models were tested in a wind tunnel condition. The results indicate that the drag coefficient of a boxfish is around 0.24 which is significantly lower than current drag coefficient of a passenger car. The car design inspired by boxfish also energy efficient than a commercially manufactured passenger car. Hence, a boxfish shape can be adapted for achieving low drag and energy efficient motor vehicle design."
"Industry-oriented project-based learning of software engineering Software; Software Process; Project-Based Learning Teaching of Software Engineering is challenging, especially when dealing with large cohorts of students, as well as cohorts with the diversity in the students' backgrounds, workloads and availabilities for face-to-face study. Especially challenging it becomes when we aim not only to provide necessary theoretical knowledge, but also to improve students' employability by making the projects really industry-oriented. This paper presents our experience on the redesign of Software Engineering project course to meet the above challenges, the lessons learned and the feedback from the students. The course is provided for both Bachelor and Master students at their final year of study, so our goal is to make students work-ready and to provide opportunities for networking with local and global companies, as well as other university disciplines."
"Sustainable development and environmental restoration in Lake Erhai, China China; Dewatering; Confined Aquifer Eutrophication of lakes is an environmental issue that has attracted increasing attention all over the world. This study analyses the monitoring data of the Lake Erhai, Yunnan Province in China with Carlson's TSI, Improving Carlson's TSI (TSIM) and TLI. The results reveal that the eutrophication index for this lake is in the Mesotrophic status. The mechanism of the eutrophication in Lake Erhai is also investigated. The mechanism shows that rate of nutrient transformation is the core issue and the process of eutrophic evolution involves natural, social, and economic factors. The restrictions on sustainable development in Lake Erhai are discussed. To maintain sustainable development, green watershed construction (GWC) and its corresponding effective measures are proposed. Moreover, lessons learned from Lake Erhai watershed management are presented, to provide valuable experiences for alleviating water pollution caused by insufficient environmental management during rapid economic development. Perspective future research works are proposed, including establishment of the early warning system with remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) as well as the artificial intelligence (AI) technology."
"Teaching Battery Basics in Laboratories: Hands-On Versus Simulated Experiments Virtual Laboratory; Education; Labview Contribution: Prior studies comparing the effectiveness of different laboratory learning modes do not allow one to draw a universally valid conclusion, as other influences are mixed with the learning modes. In order to contribute to the existing body of work and to add another piece to the puzzle, this article demonstrates an improved methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of computer-simulated laboratories in comparison to hands-on exercises using a battery basics practical course as a case study. Background: Computer-simulated experiments are becoming increasingly popular for conducting laboratory exercises in higher education and vocational training institutions. To ensure the consistent quality of laboratory learning, an accurate comparison between the results of simulated experiments and practical hands-on experiments is required. Intended Outcomes: In this article, the achievement of the following learning objectives were compared between the two laboratory modes: 1) comprehension of the most important parameters of battery cells and 2) knowledge on how these parameters can be determined using adequate experimental procedures. Application Design: To avoid interference of factors other than laboratory mode on the learning, laboratory instructions and experimental interfaces ensured identical execution of the experiments in the compared modes. Using a counterbalanced methodology, the two laboratory modes alternated by the session, while the experimental procedures remained constant regardless of the respective modes. Findings: Tests taken by the participants after conducting the laboratory experiments revealed that hands-on laboratories resulted in statistically significantly better student performance than simulated laboratories. This difference was even more pronounced for the participants that finished a vocational education and training program before the university studies."
"Techno-economics and Sensitivity Analysis of Microalgae as Commercial Feedstock for Bioethanol Production Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water The foremost purpose of this techno-economic analysis (TEA) modeling was to predict a harmonized figure of comprehensive cost analysis for commercial bioethanol generation from microalgae species in Brunei Darussalam based on the conventional market scenario. This model was simulated to set out economic feasibility and probabilistic assumption for large-scale implementations of a tropical microalgae species, Chlorella vulgaris, for a bioethanol plant located in the coastal area of Brunei Darussalam. Two types of cultivation systems such as closed system (photobioreactorâ€”PBR) and open pond approaches were anticipated for a total approximate biomass of 220 t yearâˆ’1 on 6 ha coastal areas. The biomass productivity was 56 t haâˆ’1 for PBR and 28 t haâˆ’1 for pond annually. The plant output was 58.90 m3 haâˆ’1 for PBR and 24.9 m3 haâˆ’1 for pond annually. The total bioethanol output of the plant was 57,087.58 gal yearâˆ’1 along with the value added by-products (crude bio-liquid and slurry cake). The total production cost of this project was US$2.22 million for bioethanol from microalgae and total bioethanol selling price was US$2.87 million along with the by-product sale price of US$1.6 million. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to forecast the uncertainty of this conclusive modeling. Different data sets through sensitivity analysis also presented positive impacts of economical and environmental views. This TEA model is expected to be initialized to determine an alternative energy and also minimize environmental pollution. With this current modeling, microalgal-bioethanol utilization mandated with gasoline as well as microalgae cultivation, biofuel production integrated with existing complementary industries, are strongly recommended for future applications.

"A review of methods for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms Bacteroidales; Seashore; Fecal Bacterium The testing and rapid detection of pathogenic organisms is a crucial protocol in the prevention and identification of crises related to health, safety and wellbeing. Pathogen detection has become one of the most challenging aspects in the food and water industries, because of the rapid spread of waterborne and foodborne diseases in the community and at significant costs. With the prospect of inevitable population growth, and an influx of tourism to certain water bodies testing will become a requirement to control and prevent possible outbreaks of potentially fatal illnesses. The legislation is already particularly rigorous in the food industry, where failure to detect pathogenic materials represents a catastrophic event, particularly for the elderly, very young or immune-compromised population types. In spite of the need and requirement for rapid analytical testing, conventional and standard bacterial detection assays may take up to seven days to yield a result. Given the advent of new technologies, biosensors, chemical knowledge and miniaturisation of instrumentation this timescale is not acceptable. This review presents an opportunity to fill a knowledge gap for an extremely important research area; discussing the main techniques, biology, chemistry, miniaturisation, sensing and the emerging state-of-the-art research and developments for detection of pathogens in food, water, blood and faecal samples."
"Flood Hazard Assessment and Mapping: A Case Study from Australia’s Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment Radar Altimetry; Flood Hazards; Remote Sensing Floods are among the costliest natural hazards, in Australia and globally. In this study, we used an indicator-based method to assess flood hazard risk in Australiaâ€™s Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment (HNC). Australian flood risk assessments are typically spatially constrained through the common use of resource-intensive flood modelling. The large spatial scale of this study area is the primary element of novelty in this research. The indicators of maximum 3-day precipitation (M3DP), distance to riverâ€”elevation weighted (DREW), and soil moisture (SM) were used to create the final Flood Hazard Index (FHI). The 17â€“26 March 2021 flood event in the HNC was used as a case study. It was found that almost 85% of the HNC was classified by the FHI at â€˜severeâ€™ or â€˜extremeâ€™ level, illustrating the extremity of the studied event. The urbanised floodplain area in the central-east of the HNC had the highest FHI values. Conversely, regions along the western border of the catchment had the lowest flood hazard risk. The DREW indicator strongly correlated with the FHI. The M3DP indicator displayed strong trends of extreme rainfall totals increasing towards the eastern catchment border. The SM indicator was highly variable, but featured extreme values in conservation areas of the HNC. This study introduces a method of large-scale proxy flood hazard assessment that is novel in an Australian context. A proof-of-concept methodology of flood hazard assessment developed for the HNC is replicable and could be applied to other flood-prone areas elsewhere."
"Durable Antibacterial and Antifungal Hierarchical Silver-Embedded Poly(vinylidene fluoride- co-hexafluoropropylene) Fabricated Using Electrospinning Chitosan; Electrospinning; Nanofibers The aim of this study was to demonstrate the use of electrospinning to produce hierarchical fibrous structures for antibacterial and antifungal applications. Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are produced in situ within an electrospinning solution with the help of a solvent acting as a reducing agent. Ag NP-filled poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) fibers were produced by electrospinning this solution. The collected fibers were placed on top of a porous anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) template, and the setup was heated above the glass-transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer. Heating above Tg enabled the polymer to flow into the porous channels of the AAO template and led to the fabrication of hierarchical PVDF-HFP fibers filled with Ag NPs. The microstructure of the samples revealed that the nanostructures were formed uniformly on the surface of the fibers. The wettability of the samples was measured by determining the contact angle, and it was revealed that the wettability of hierarchical fibrous structures was higher than the wettability of PVDF-HFP-filled Ag NPs. Lastly, the antimicrobial activity results revealed that both PVDF-HFP fibers filled with Ag NPs and the hierarchical PVDF-HFP fibers filled with Ag NPs exhibited inhibition against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. The antibacterial and antifungal performance for the samples was determined, and it was found that the hierarchical fibrous structures showed the highest antibacterial and antifungal performance against MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans in comparison to the neat PVDF-HFP fibers and PVDF-HFP fibers filled with Ag NPs. We also demonstrated that these fibers can be strongly antibacterial and antifungal after a number of usages. This may be attributed to the slow and long-lasting release of silver ions from the electrospun fibers. Hierarchical PVDF-HFP filled with Ag NPs showed the lowest relative bacterial viability (less than 5%) against MRSA in all three cycles. The relative bacterial and fungal viability against P. aeruginosa and C. albicans was determined to be less than 15%. These findings demonstrate that the fabricated antibacterial and antifungal fibers show tremendous promise for applications such as air filtration, water treatment, protective clothing, and so forth."
"Distributed participatory design in crowdsourced information systems development Scrum; Agile Software Development; Project Management Distributed participatory design (DPD) is an approach to information systems development (ISD) where different stakeholders participate in the development and design of information systems in distributed design teams which are mostly online on Internet, web-based, and social media platforms. User participation in online DPD projects is primarily voluntary and the participants are typically unaffiliated with the development organisation. Going beyond individual methods, techniques, and practices and to extend research on participatory approaches to ISD beyond conventional settings, roles and types of participants, we are interested in how DPD projects in crowdsourced ISD are managed and performed in their entirety. To answer this research question we studied a case of DPD in crowdsourced ISD in the context of a DPD project which engaged Pacific Youth in the development of a digital game. As contemporary ISD is generally acknowledged as a complex activity we apply complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory to better understand and make recommendations for ISD practice."
"Trends in HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality in Eastern Mediterranean countries, 1990–2015: findings from the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study Global Burden of Disease; Disability-Adjusted Life Year; Disability Weights Objectives: We used the results of the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study to estimate trends of HIV/AIDS burden in Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries between 1990 and 2015. Methods: Tailored estimation methods were used to produce final estimates of mortality. Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated by multiplying the mortality rate by population by age-specific life expectancy. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were computed as the prevalence of a sequela multiplied by its disability weight. Results: In 2015, the rate of HIV/AIDS deaths in the EMR was 1.8 (1.4â€“2.5) per 100,000 population, a 43% increase from 1990 (0.3; 0.2â€“0.8). Consequently, the rate of YLLs due to HIV/AIDS increased from 15.3 (7.6â€“36.2) per 100,000 in 1990 to 81.9 (65.3â€“114.4) in 2015. The rate of YLDs increased from 1.3 (0.6â€“3.1) in 1990 to 4.4 (2.7â€“6.6) in 2015. Conclusions: HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality increased in the EMR since 1990. To reverse this trend and achieve epidemic control, EMR countries should strengthen HIV surveillance, and scale up HIV antiretroviral therapy and comprehensive prevention services."
"Dynamic Graph Attention Network For Traveling Officer Problem Parking; Internet Of Things; Cruising The proliferation of illegal parking has a major impact on traffic safety and efficiency. The problem of studying how to capture as many parking infringements as possible in a limited time is called Traveling Officer Problem (TOP), which is a variant of Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Compared with TSP, the state of the nodes in the path of TOP changes (0 or 1) over time and the time is limited. The purpose of TOP is to capture as many points with the state of 1 as possible in a limited time. According to the parking information provided by the traffic management system, we propose a Dynamic Graph Attention Network (DGAT) to address this problem. The results on real datasets from Melbourne, Australia show that our model has clear advantages over other optimization algorithms in many metrics, especially the capture rate."
"Identifying influential nodes of global terrorism network: A comparison for skeleton network extraction Betweenness; Spreaders; Complex Network The inherent structure and substantial information on global terrorism network are often understood by identifying influential nodes. Recently, novel node identification methods are developed from different perspectives. Each of them has trade-offs and strengths. However, the algorithms for exploring the key influential nodes have been adopted unevenly in light of network extraction research. A set of nodes that is more favorable to define the core network structure is unclear. In this paper, we, therefore, present a comparative study of node identification methods over the global terrorism network. The new insight each method contributes to identifying key influential nodes and core network structure is investigated. Six comparative methods are verified by the SIR model and monotonicity index. We further elaborate on experimental analysis by applying the critical nodes from each method to extract the skeleton network. All extracted skeletons are eventually compared with the original network in terms of node correlation and network structural-equivalence. Thus, the comparison and results not only used to reflect the potential of different methods to a particular network structure but also guide us to select a method that works best for extracting the skeleton network of real-world global terrorism."
"Stroke Severity, and Not Cerebral Infarct Location, Increases the Risk of Infection Brain Ischemia; Inflammation; Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction Infection is a leading cause of death in patients with stroke; however, the impact of cerebral infarct size or location on infectious outcome is unclear. To examine the effect of infarct size on post-stroke infection, we utilised the intraluminal middle-cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model of ischemic stroke and adjusted the duration of arterial occlusion. At 1 day following stroke onset, the proportion of mice with infection was significantly greater in mice that had larger infarct sizes. Additionally, the presence of lung infection in these mice with severe strokes extended past 2 days, suggestive of long-term immune impairment. At the acute phase, our data demonstrated an inverse relationship between infarct volume and the number of circulating leukocytes, indicating the elevated risk of infection in more severe stroke is associated with reduced cellularity in peripheral blood, owing predominately to markedly decreased lymphocyte numbers. In addition, the stroke-induced reduction of lymphocyte-to-neutrophil ratio was also evident in the lung of all post-stroke animals. To investigate the effect of infarct location on post-stroke infection, we additionally performed a photothrombotic (PT) model of stroke and using an innovative systematic approach of analysis, we found the location of cerebral infarct does not impact on the susceptibility of post-stroke infection, confirming the greater role of infarct volume over infarct location in the susceptibility to infection. Our experimental findings were validated in a clinical setting and reinforced that stroke severity, and not infarct location, influences the risk of infection after stroke."
"State of the Art on Sustainability Assessment of Positive Energy Districts: Methodologies, Indicators and Future Perspectives Smart Cities; Big Data; Internet of Things The concept of Positive Energy District is one of the main areas of research and extensive applications of the principles of the clean energy transition within the building sector. In the past years, the most widely accepted definitions have focused specifically on carbon neutrality, while several other aspects regarding all sustainability approaches (including environmental, social and economic perspective) were included qualitatively or to a lesser degree. This paper proposes a discussion on the state of the art of the sustainability assessment of Positive Energy Districts, by investigating environmental, social and economic sustainability applications. The three sustainability dimensions are investigated individually first, while discussing methodological insights, key performance indicators used and quantitative results, as well as in an integrated perspective. Finally, the paper describes research gaps and areas for further development on the topic."
"Review of resilience assessment of coastal bridges to extreme wave-induced loads Wave Force; Coast; Tsunamis Coastal bridges are susceptible to severe damage due to wave-induced forces during extreme events such as coastal flooding, hurricanes, storm surges and tsunamis. As a direct impact of climate change, the frequency and intensity of these events are also expected to increase in the future. This paper presents a comprehensive review of a four-phase resilience assessment of coastal bridge structures, namely, (i) characterization of external wave-induced forces, (ii) structural response of bridges, (iii) vulnerability assessment of damaged components, and (iv) post-disaster recovery. The four comprehensive modules are adopted from the classic framework of PEER PBEE and constitute the integrated knowledge needed for the prediction of the resilience of infrastructure under extreme wave-induced loads. The study also presents new expressions for resilience restoration that simultaneously account for the time, resources (cost) and environmental impacts of different recovery options with variable importance levels to different stakeholders."
"“Dropping out and working”: The vocational narratives of creative graduates Cultural Economy; Freelancer; Art This chapter focuses on the vocational narratives of creative graduates. Using qualitative interviews from Australia and the UK, it reflects on how vocational identities are produced by creatives and how they understand the relationship between creative skills and employment more broadly. Using the concept of â€œnarratives of employabilityâ€ and reflecting on the inability of creative graduates to use their educational credentials, we highlight how the â€œlived and narrated experienceâ€ that is not only reported but continuously performed and embodied, becomes a key object of analysis. The findings highlight that such narratives balance a set of common oppositions, such as commitment/flexibility, autonomy/instrumentalism, and personal effort/constraints of social context. We observe that vocational narratives are used in relation to managing (financial) risk and â€œembeddedâ€ forms of creative work, allowing graduates to fine-tune their vocational identity within creative work in and outside of the creative industries."
"A review on process and practices in operation and design modification of ejectors Ejectors; Cold Chain; Heat Pump Systems This work reviews the current operational condition and activities on design modification for different applications of ejectors. Ejectors being a simple mechanical system capable of perform-ing multiple fluid related functions (vacuum generation, pumping, mixing, condensing and heat exchanging), have been an essential part of several industrial processes. Two areas have been em-phasized; internal flow and application-based modifications in components of ejectors. The geometry and inlet flow conditions were found to be the prime influencing factor of its performance. The objective and application-based modifications were performed on the primary nozzle, secondary nozzle, mixing chamber, throat and diffuser. The resultant performance was found to be dependent on operational condition and fluid type. This emphasizes the requirement of application-based design selection of the technology. In addition, the flow dynamics of condensing, non-condensing, particle and slurry flow has been studied based on available literatures. The one-point final objective is to identify the usability of primary water jet ejectors for active vapor transport and condensation, to replace vacuum pump and condenser in compact domestic water desalination system."
"Shape Grammar Approach to 3D Modeling of Indoor Environments Using Point Clouds Point Cloud; Floor Plan; Indoor Environment As-is three-dimensional (3D) models of indoor environments are of paramount importance for a variety of applications such as navigation assistance and emergency response. Whereas manual reconstruction of 3D indoor models is a time-consuming task, methods for automatic or semiautomatic reconstruction can achieve a significant reduction of the time and labor required for indoor modeling. This paper proposes a new shape grammar approach for efficient generation of 3D models of indoor environments from point clouds. The shape grammar derives 3D models of complex environments by using a simple primitive and iterative application of grammar rules governed by a production procedure. The method can reconstruct both building elements and navigable spaces along with their topological relations. It produces 3D parametric models with high geometric accuracy and rich semantic content compliant with building information modeling (BIM) standards. Experiments on synthetic and real data sets show the ability of the method to generate highly accurate indoor models with computation times ranging from seconds to a few minutes. The usefulness of the output models in supporting indoor path planning at varying granularities is also demonstrated."
"Concentrating solar power tower technology: Present status and outlook Parabolic; Solar Power Plants; Solar Thermal Energy The paper examines design and operating data of current concentrated solar power (CSP) solar tower (ST) plants. The study includes CSP with or without boost by combustion of natural gas (NG), and with or without thermal energy storage (TES). Latest, actual specific costs per installed capacity are high, 6,085 $/kW for Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System (ISEGS) with no TES, and 9,227 $/kW for Crescent Dunes with TES. Actual production of electricity is low and less than the expected. Actual capacity factors are 22% for ISEGS, despite combustion of a significant amount of NG exceeding the planned values, and 13% for Crescent Dunes. The design values were 33% and 52%. The study then reviews the proposed technology updates to improve ratio of solar field power to electric power, capacity factor, matching of production and demand, plant's cost, reliability and life span of plant's components. Key areas of progress are found in materials and manufacturing processes, design of solar field and receiver, receiver and power block fluids, power cycle parameters, optimal management of daily and seasonal operation of the plant, new TES concepts, integration of solar plant with thermal desalination or combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) installations and specialization of project."
"Phragmites australis associates with belowground fungal communities characterized by high diversity and pathogen abundance Soil Biota; Solidago Canadensis; Soil Microbial symbionts are gaining attention as crucial drivers of invasive species spread and dominance. To date, much research has quantified the net effects of plant-microbe interactions on the relative success of native and invasive species. However, little is known about how the structure (composition and diversity) of microbial symbionts can differ among native and invasive species, or vary across the invasive landscape. Here, we explore the structure of endosphere and soil fungal communities associated with a monoculture-forming widespread invader, Phragmites australis, and co-occurring native species. Using field survey data from marshes in coastal Louisiana, we tested three hypotheses: (1) Phragmites australis root and soil fungal communities differ from that of co-occurring natives, (2) Phragmites australis monocultures harbor distinct fungal communities at the expanding edge compared to the monodominant center, and (3) proximity to the P. australis invading front alters native root endosphere and soil fungal community structure. We found that P. australis cultivates root and soil fungal communities with higher richness, diversity, and pathogen abundances compared to native species. While P. australis was found to have higher endosphere pathogen abundances at its expanding edge compared to the monodominant center, we found no evidence of compositional changes or pathogen spillover in native species in close proximity to the invasion front. This work suggests that field measurements of fungal endosphere communities in native and invasive plants are useful to help understand (or rule out) mechanisms of invasion."
"Integrating teaching and learning with inter-disciplinary action research in support of climate resilient urban development Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience The capital cities of the South Pacific are experiencing rapid urbanisation pressures as increasing numbers of people migrate to the primary cities either in search of employment and greater access to healthcare and education, or as a consequence of environmental 'push' factors. However, the limited capacity of municipal Governments to respond to the scale and pace of change is leading to a growth of informal settlements in peri-urban locations. Factors of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity combine to make these informal settlements the most vulnerable areas to natural hazards. In response to this critical urban resilience agenda, this paper looks at how participatory action research is providing inter-disciplinary scientific support for the implementation of urban resilience and climate actions in Honiara, Solomon Islands. Adaptation measures involve a combination of hard and soft actions; as well as activities designed to strengthen local capacity to respond to contemporary resilience challenges. Addressing the adaptive capacity component, this paper also highlights the opportunities for Australian universities to integrate teaching and learning with action research to achieve a substantive real-world impact in the Pacific region, as well as illustrating the capacity strengthening benefits that can be achieved through sustained engagement and collaborative partnerships with local organisations."
"Pandemic responses at the subnational level: Exploring politics, administration, and politicization in Swedish municipalities Network Governance; Sector; Disaster Response The Swedish response to the pandemic at the national level has attracted considerable international attention, but little focus has been placed on the way municipalities dealt with the crisis. Using Hay's dimensions of politicization, namely the capacity for human agency, deliberation in the public domain, and social context, we analyze the politicization of the municipal response to the pandemic in Sweden. We do this based on the analysis of the decision making process to activate (or not) an extraordinary crisis management committee. We find inter alia, that (i) only a quarter of the municipalities activated the committee while a majority of them had an alternate special organization in place; (ii) support to the existing organizational structure was more salient than creating an extraordinary organization, and (iii) a robust municipal structure was deemed to be one able to withstand shocks without resorting to extraordinary governance arrangements. We find a â€˜conditioned politicizationâ€™ of the response, privileging administration over politics."
"Significance of implementing decentralized biogas solutions in india: A viable pathway for biobased economy Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production In recent years, world economy has achieved considerable economic and social development, but this has resulted in the widespread degradation and depletion of our natural environment. Solid-waste generation increases exponentionally due to the rapid urbanization, but inappropriate waste handling causes health hazards and urban environment degradation. The goal of strengthening bio-based economy is potentially related to biogas solutions with respect to solid waste management in several ways. Bio based economy demands new ways of philosophy and co-opera-tion within and across sectors to minimise the environmental footprint and climate change throughout the value chain. The range and significance of biogas technologies has increased rapidly during the last 30 years for the treatment of organic waste. The typical way of perceiving the role of biogas solutions is as a last step in cascading the biomass where renewable energy in the form of biogas is produced along with bio-fertiliser. Among the existing technologies for waste treatment, anaerobic digestion (AD) plays a key role in reducing waste along with the generation of renewable energy as it plays a key role in reducing the adverse effects on environmental and climatic changes of the biosphere such as the reduction of NOx and CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, leading to reduced carbon foot print and reduction in solid waste accumulation. However, AD of organic waste with conventional digesters is not practicable for the processing of large quantities of waste generated in India. The aim of the present work is to present knowledge and technological gaps between slow rate and high rate biogas solutions that emerged in India, used to replace conventional fuels with renewable and green fuel (biogas) through initiatives taken up by the governmental and private organizations."
"Water/watery/watering: Concepts for Theorising in Environmental Education Water Rights; Political Ecology; Peru The assemblage of water/watery/watering is a lively cartography of how water may be accounted for when theorising with and through environmental education research. Challenging the universalising claims of Western technoscience and the colonial logic of extraction, the article develops an alternative theoretical mapping of environmental education through engagements with Ingold's (2007, 2012, 2015) concepts of lines, knots, and knotting. For this article and for the Special Issue in which it is housed, the concepts of such knottings are defined as an assemblage of haecceities, lived events that are looped, tethered and entangled as material and conceptual agencies that inhere within situated encounters. Thus, this article grapples with the need to account for water differently in contemporary posthuman ecologies. To overcome anthropocentric and mastery-oriented approaches, various other ways to account for water in science or environmental education will continue to come to the surface, bubbling and rushing like a waterfall as they have done in this work. Some of these will include thinking with water, which will be central to a theoretical mapping of water that seeks embrace sticky knots. The article explores a (re)turn to artful practices and encounters as spaces in which posthumanist concepts for environmental education might be cultivated."
"Making time for life: A whole-of-industry initiative to reducing work hours and promoting health and gender inclusion in project-based construction work Work-Family Conflict; Work-Life Balance; Personnel A cross section of participants representing a â€˜vertical sliceâ€™ of the construction industry workforce were interviewed to: (i) understand the way that long hours are experienced by project-based workers and the factors contributing to the long hours culture, and (ii) explore the factors motivating a â€˜whole of industryâ€™ cultural reform initiative focused on reducing work hours in the Australian construction industry. Deeply entrenched systems of work within the construction industry, including competitive tendering processes and the imposition of financial penalties for time overruns, contribute to long work hours that are detrimental to workers' health and wellbeing. Moreover, construction companies develop project programs on the basis of assumptions that projects will run smoothly in all respects. Risks associated with program â€˜slippageâ€™ are passed down the supply chain to subcontractors. The problem of long work hours in construction project work means that a single organisation (whether client or constructor) cannot adequately address the issue. This has led to public sector client organizations and private sector construction organizations to engage in a unique collaborative initiative to reduce work hours and, in doing so, enable health, wellbeing and gender diversity in the Australian construction industry."
"Mobile money and women’s decision-making power in India Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion In this chapter, the authors use data from the Financial Inclusion Insights (FII) program to examine the association between mobile money and female decision-making power in India. Drawing on different proxies for female decision-making power, the authors show that awareness of, and the use of, mobile money is not sufficient to change behaviours and cultural norms. The authors argue that programs designed to encourage women to take up mobile money products will not be successful unless women actively utilise these bank accounts. The chapter provides some policy insights on how to promote empowerment using financial technologies in cash-based economies such as India."
"A water-based pressure casting method for transtibial prosthetic socket fit in developing countries Amputation; Lower Extremity; Prosthetic Fitting Many challenges are faced by large numbers of people with lower limb amputation in developing countries. Foremost are cost and access to skilled prosthetic services. Attempts have been made to develop socket fabrication techniques that require little or no prosthetic skill. This study investigated a water pressure casting technique (PCAST) to fabricate and fit transtibial (TT) prosthetic sockets. Ethics approval and informed consent were obtained. Fifty-three adults with unilateral TT amputation were recruited from VIETCOT (Hanoi). VIETCOT staff with ISPO category II qualifications fabricated and fitted the prostheses. Firstly, a cotton sock was placed over the residual limb followed by a plaster wrap. The participant stood with the intact limb on a weight-scale and placed the residual limb into a plastic bag-type diaphragm housed in a cylindrical tank filled with water until they stood normally with half body weight supported. Upon hardening a positive plaster model was made and a socket fabricated with a distal pelite cap. A polypropylene socket was then moulded and attached to ICRC prosthetic components and a rubber foot. The same person fabricated, fitted and aligned the prosthesis. Once a participant indicated satisfaction, the following tasks were completed: timed up-and-go (TUG), six-minute walk (6MWT), walking (GAITRite mat) and satisfaction questionnaire (SATPRO). These tasks were also completed after an extended usage period (146 Â± 28 days). Thirty-one of the participants were successfully fitted: fourteen fits failed, eight failed to return, withdrew or became deceased. SATPRO (n = 31) showed high levels of satisfaction (81%) on both test occasions. 6MWT increased by 28 m (p = 0.01) after the usage period. TUG, SATPRO and gait measures remained unchanged. A sub-analysis (n = 21) compared PCAST performance to original socket and prosthesis. No differences were found. In conclusion, the PCAST may assist people with TT amputation in developing countries."
"The long-term impact of the Vietnam War on agricultural productivity Infant Health; War Exposure; Child Health We present causal evidence of the long-term effects of the Vietnam War on household agricultural productivity. Using bombing intensity data and data on the intensity of Agent Orange and other chemical agents used during the War, we find that spatial differences in the intensity of the War can help explain differences in long-term household agricultural productivity. Our endogeneity-corrected estimates suggest that, in the long-term, a 10% increase in bombing intensity decreases rice productivity by 2.94% and total agricultural productivity by 3.21%. Results from a fuzzy regression discontinuity design suggest that Agent Orange intensity also had a negative effect on rice productivity. We find that economic production is a channel through which the intensity of bombing and Agent Orange have adversely affected long-term agricultural productivity, while social capital is a channel through which Agent Orange is linked to lower long-term agricultural productivity."
"Contingent Effect of Board Gender Diversity on Performance in Emerging Markets: Evidence from the Egyptian Revolution Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence The 2011 Egyptian revolution was associated with significant political and social upheaval, followed by societal changes and attempts by policymakers to reduce the marginalisation of women and promote their inclusion in the economy. Drawing on this background, the authors compare the effect of board gender diversity before and after the revolution. Results indicate that gender diversity in corporate boards is coupled with improvements in firm performance in the immediate post revolution phase. This evidence provides insights into the contextual factors related to diversity and performance relationship and supporting arguments for regulatory changes to further encourage womenâ€™s representation on boards."
"The Distribution of Artistic Human Capital – A Typology Building Approach Agglomeration Economies; Creative Class; China Artists have long been understood to play a vital role in local communities. Our intent is to develop a deeper understanding of the distribution of artistic human capital; specifically, the extent to which particular patterns of co-location exist across Australia. We find little evidence of patterns by type of artistic human capital. Interestingly, however, our analysis does reveal a form of grouping that enables us to prescribe a typology based on the degree to which the number of types of artistic human capital resides. Using this typology we explore differences among states and regions across Australia."
"Mapping informal settlement indicators using object-oriented analysis in the Middle East Remote Sensing; Informal Settlements; Building Density Mapping informal settlements is crucial for resource and utility management and planning. In 2003, the UN-Habitat developed a process for mapping and monitoring urban inequality to support reporting against the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Informal settlement indicators are used as a framework to carry out image analysis, and include vegetation extent, lacunarity of housing structures / vacant land, road segment type and materials, texture measures of built-up areas, roofing extent of built-up areas and dwelling size. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods are recommended to identify informal settlements. This paper documents the application of OBIA to map informal settlements, drawing on the ontology of Kohli et al. (2012) and the indicators of Owen and Wong (2013) for a Middle Eastern city. Three informal settlements with different land use histories were selected to represent old and new informal settlements in the city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Vegetation extent was the most successful indicator detected, with 100% producer accuracy and over 84% user accuracy, followed by the road network, with 84% producer and user accuracies in older informal settlements and 73% producer accuracy and 96% user accuracy across all case studies. Lacunarity of housing structures / vacant land was detected well in informal settlements. The texture measure indicator was detected using GLCMEnt(R) with low producer accuracy across all case studies. The roofing extent of the built-up area is detected with better producer and user accuracies than texture measures. The dwellings size indicator generally failed to distinguish formal from informal settlements. Informal and formal were distinguished with an overall accuracy of 83%. This research concludes that OBIA is a useful method to map informal settlement indicators in Middle Eastern cities. However, a generic ruleset for mapping informal settlements remains elusive, and each indicator requires significant localised â€˜tuningâ€™."
"Decent work for sustainable development in post-crisis Nepal: Social policy challenges and a way forward Welfare Regimes; Public Policy; Nepal Although the Decent Work agenda has received significant attention in the context of sustainable development, the formulation and implementation of appropriate social policies in developing countries remain an underexplored subject. This article responds to this gap and traces country-specific Decent Work related policies and programs in Nepalâ€”which is recovering from two major crises: a decade-long armed conflict that ended in 2006 as well as the 2015 earthquake. Drawing on Critical Policy Analysis framework, this article examines how key tenets of the International Labour Organisation's Decent Work platform, namely creation and provision of employment, social protection, social dialogue and rights at work have manifested in Nepal. The findings indicate that while attempts have been made to embrace the Decent Work agenda into social policies and programs, structural instability of political processes means that there is a lack of strategic directions to address a capacity deficit specific to the informal sector and outbound labour migrants. The article makes broader analytical contributions towards evaluating the implementation of social policies driven by the global priority in the context of developing nations with weak governance settings. In countries like Nepal, where the majority of workers are located within the informal sector and as such the administrative reach and effectiveness of Decent Work related social policies designed for the formal sector are limited."
"Indonesia in the spotlight: Combating corruption through ICT enabled governance Open Government; Transparency; E-Governance This paper puts Indonesia in the spotlight assessing the country's ability to combat corruption through ICT enabled governance. The research firstly tries to define governance through the different lens of intergovernmental organisations. This is followed by a comparative analysis of different situational characteristics of governance in developing and developed countries. The paper then explores the role of governance in Indonesia, highlighting the existing barriers, and potential drivers to the implementation of ICT in Indonesia. It is concluded that ICT enabled good governance needs to be in place to support the eradication of corruption in Indonesia. Corruption in Indonesia is considered systematic as the practice is prevalent across public organisations in the country. This study contributes to the information systems discipline by offering new insights into the issues of implementing ICT enabled open governance in developing countries such as Indonesia."
"“Splitting the bill” for conservation: Perceptions and uptake of financial incentives by landholders managing privately protected areas Easement; Private Lands; Landowners Globally, privately protected area (PPA) programs are increasing in size and number. Participating in a PPA program can be fiscally challenging for landholders (e.g., enrollment costs; potential reduction in land value; opportunity costs; costs of ongoing management). Government and nongovernmental organizations often offer financial incentives to landholders, in addition to nonfinancial incentives, to encourage program enrollment and ongoing biodiversity management. In Australia, where conservation covenanting programs have been ongoing for several decades, a diversity of financial incentives is available to landholders. We surveyed 527 conservation covenantors from three states in southeast Australia to investigate the uptake, use, experience and preference for financial incentives. Less than half of covenantors received a financial incentive to enroll, but most applied for some form of incentive after enrollment, predominantly to help with management costs. Covenantors identified challenges in accessing incentives, such as being unaware of funding opportunities or experiencing confusing application processes. We found land rates rebates to be the preferred financial incentive among covenantors, in part due to the perception that covenantors should not have to pay full rates on covenanted land. Our results suggest that while covenantors do not participate in PPA programs for financial incentives, effectively and efficiently deploying financial incentives can reduce the financial burdens of PPA management, potentially increasing the effectiveness of conservation efforts."
"Has the Evergrande debt crisis rattled Chinese capital markets? A series of event studies and their implications Sovereign Ratings; Credit Rating Agencies; Firm In response to the global concern of the Evergrande debt crisis, we document several findings of the crisis's contagion effect. First, although most real estate companies have strong financial fundamentals, the high default risk among large firms sends an alarming signal. Second, the spillover effect to peer developers is stronger in the credit market than in the stock market. Finally, the systemic financial risk of the banking sector remains low during the crisis. Overall, while there is a low probability of a wide-ranging financial crisis, a debt crisis in the real estate sector might be on the horizon."
"Mandatory integrated reporting disclosure and corporate misreporting Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: This paper aims to enrich our understanding of whether mandatory IR adoption lures firm into misreporting or forces them to reduce it. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical analysis is carried out based on the sample containing all publicly listed firms in South Africa. Many different rigorous econometric techniques are adopted to thoroughly evaluate whether corporate misreporting practices increase or decrease following the mandatory adoption of IR. Findings: The empirical results reveal that mandatory IR disclosure results in a decline in the misreporting practices of firms. The authors further find that as firms increasingly comply with the IR guidelines, especially with the â€œContent Elementsâ€ and â€œGuiding Principles,â€ their misreporting levels decrease. Research limitations/implications: This study has implications for a wide range of stakeholders, especially for regulatory authorities, international policymakers and regulators, as well as users of integrated reports of listed firms on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). Practical implications: Regulatory authorities should be aware of misreporting determinants to set adequate and fitting corporate reporting standards that restrict the opportunistic behaviour of managers and amend IR guidelines to make them more comprehensible for integrated report preparers, therefore improves the implementation of IR. Social implications: This study sheds light on the current state and consequences of IR adoption in South Africa before and after the mandatory IR disclosure requirement, thus, international policymakers and regulators can refer to the critical aspects in our findings when considering whether to support IR mandatory adoption in their markets. Originality/value: This paper sheds light on the emerging debate over the usefulness of IR and the necessity of mandatorily adopting this new reporting framework. In addition, by showing that the mandatory adoption of IR significantly reduces corporate misreporting practices, we also contribute to the literature on corporate misreporting behaviour."
"Unpacking the meaning of resilience: the Tarnagulla community definition comparing to the literature Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience In 2018, the Tarnagulla Alternative Energy Group in regional Victoria took steps to plan futures for their town and its local community that strengthened resilience to the many challenges in the area including those from climate change. Believing that â€˜anticipation strategies work against known problems, while resilient strategies are better against unknown problems' (IFRC 2012, p.5) the group turned to the RMIT Climate Change Transformations group to unpack the meaning of resilience as it related to the town and community. The purpose was to produce a locally-focused Resilience Action Plan. Despite an international consensus and media propagation of resilience as a silver bullet to address future uncertainties, the concept remains contentious and challenging to implement. This paper considers how the various framings of resilienceâ€”the â€˜conceptual' (in literature) and the â€˜operational' (in policy)â€”relate to the Tarnagulla community's lived experience and the implications. The comparison allows to unpack a mixture of the complexities in understanding the nature of values, preferences, expectations, capacities, contested knowledge, as well as, the uncertainties. Study findings show that communities are best placed to frame their resilience, collectively and from a â€˜systems' perspective, and that implementing actions, which may require radical change, hinge on a political voice and sustained support from policy makers."
"Weekend and weekday associations between the residential built environment and physical activity: Findings from the ENABLE London study Report Cards; Mode Choice; Built Environment Background We assessed whether the residential built environment was associated with physical activity (PA) differently on weekdays and weekends, and contributed to socio-economic differences in PA. Methods Measures of PA and walkability, park proximity and public transport accessibility were derived for baseline participants (n = 1,064) of the Examining Neighbourhood Activities in Built Living Environments in London (ENABLE London) Study. Multilevel-linear-regressions examined associations between weekend and weekday steps and Moderate to Vigorous PA (MVPA), residential built environment factors, and housing tenure status as a proxy for socio-economic position. Results A one-unit decrease in walkability was associated with 135 (95% CI [28; 242]) fewer steps and 1.2 (95% CI [0.3; 2.1]) fewer minutes of MVPA on weekend days, compared with little difference in steps and minutes of MVPA observed on weekdays. A 1km-increase in distance to the nearest local park was associated with 597 (95% CI [161; 1032]) more steps and 4.7 (95% CI [1.2; 8.2]) more minutes of MVPA on weekend days; 84 fewer steps (95% CI [-253;420]) and 0.3 fewer minutes of MVPA (95%CI [-2.3, 3.0]) on weekdays. Lower public transport accessibility was associated with increased steps on a weekday (767 steps, 95%CI [â€“13,1546]) compared with fewer steps on weekend days (608 fewer steps, 95% CI [â€“44, 1658]). None of the associations between built environment factors and PA on either weekend or weekdays were modified by socio-economic status. However, socio-economic differences in PA related moderately to socio-economic disparities in PA-promoting features of the residential neighbourhood. Conclusions The residential built environment is associated with PA differently at weekends and on weekdays, and contributes moderately to socio-economic differences in PA."
"Using Smartphone to Enhance Education Multitasking; Smartphone; Distraction With the growth of smartphones and associated technologies has come millions of smartphone programs which are called â€œappsâ€. Most apps are like any tool, if used sensibly they can be of value, but if used unwisely they can distract students to the detriment of their education. Many techniques that use smartphones have been proposed to help improve student learning and for better educational outcomes. This chapter looks at some of these methods that can help nullify the negative effects of smartphones in the classroom or co-opt them into helping the education process."
"Aligning citizen science with best practice: Threatened species conservation in Australia Citizen Scientists; Monitoring; Volunteers Well-designed citizen science projects can improve the capacity of the scientific community to detect and understand declines in threatened species, and with the emer-gence of frameworks to guide good design, there is an opportunity to test whether projects are aligned with best practice. We assessed the current landscape of citizen science projects for threatened species conservation via a content analysis of the online communique of citizen science projects across Australia. Only 2% of projects stated clear research questions, although approximately 86% had implied project objectives aimed at threatened species conservation. Most projects were focused on field-based monitoring activities with half using structured ecological survey methods. Most reviewed projects (65%) shared data with open access biodiversity databases and the vast majority use at least one social media platform to communi-cate with potential and existing participants (up to 81%). Approximately 50% present citizen-sourced data summaries or publications on their websites. Our study shows there is a very strong foundation for public participation in threatened species conservation activities in Australia, yet there is scope to further integrate the principles of citizen science best practice. Improved integration of these principles will likely yield better outcomes for threatened species as well as for the citizen scientists themselves."
"Sustainability in fashion and textiles: A survey from developing country Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing The manufacturing of fashion and textiles involves many processes, which has high detrimental impact on the environment. The production of fashion and textile has been found to be one of the widely environmental polluting sectors. Environmental problems such as water and air pollution, generation of large amount of waste, use of a large amount of toxic chemicals and generation of large amount of wastewater are some of the problems associated with the fashion and textile production. Due to the increased global awareness to save the planet earth, many leading fashion brands have focused to reduce the pollution caused by the production of fashion and textiles. This chapter reviews the concepts of sustainability in fashion and textile production starting from fiber to the garment manufacturing, which can reduce pollution and achieve environmental sustainability. Furthermore, among different approaches taken to achieve environmental sustainability in the most impacting step, fabric chemical processing has been illustrated. The findings of a survey based on Vietnamâ€™s fashion and textile industries are also included in this chapter. We found that the large fashion enterprises are adopting fashion sustainability due to global competition, consumer awareness, and management policy, whereas the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are struggling to survive in the global market due to limited access to funding, lack of skilled people, and lack of consumer awareness."

Finally, mainstreaming of sustainability in housing is discussed showcasing also other tools emphasizing emerging markets."
"Domestic and International Drivers of the Demand for Water Resources in the Context of Water Scarcity: A Cross-Country Study Water Demand; Family Characteristic; End Use Global warming, while increasing human demand for water, is reducing water availability by reducing runoff flows and the effective amount of water between seasons, making water scarcity a growing problem globally. Water management plays an important role in mitigating global warming, improving the water cycle, reducing carbon emissions, and providing clean energy, and pricing water is considered a good approach to water management. Pricing water needs to take into account all sectors and aspects of society, such as domestic water, food and agriculture, energy, transport, industry, urban provision, human health, ecosystems, and the environment, and their interrelationships through water, within the context of the fundamental human rights to water and sanitation. This requires that every stakeholder should contribute to the development of water-related policies at every stage of the water interrelationship. This study investigated the relationship between water demand across different sectors of the economy using indicators for China, Australia, Japan, and the UK. Using panel analyses, this study finds that economic growth and population expansion increases the demand for water in all aspects. These findings have significant policy implications for water management. Because water prices can have an impact on global trade and, more importantly, are a major solution to global warming, water management policies should be considered at the global level, not only at the national level."
"Reuse of a contaminated soil stabilized by a low-carbon binder as roadway subgrade material and mechanical performance evaluation Solidification; Cement; Portland Cement This study evaluates the feasibility of utilizing a hydroxyapatite-based binder (termed as SPC) stabilized contaminated soil in a decommissioned electroplating industry site as roadway subgrade material, where SPC is a mixture of superphosphate (SP) and calcium oxide (CaO) powders in a proportion of 3:1 by dry weight basis. Traditional Portland cement (PC) was used as a control binder for comparison purpose. The leachability of the stabilized soil was evaluated at 28 d. The engineering properties including dry density, soil resistance, and dynamic deflection modulus, were investigated at 1 d, 7 d, 28 d, and 600 d after construction. The results showed that stabilization using SPC is effective for immobilizing target contaminants of nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) in the contaminated soil and improving its mechanical properties including dry density, soil resistance, and dynamic deflection modulus. The SPC binder exhibited superior performance to PC in term of higher immobilization effectiveness of Ni and Zn, shorter curing time, and lower carbon footprint. The SPC-stabilized soil showed inferior strength, stiffness, and water sensitivity to those of the PC-stabilized soil."
"Designing a ‘Fit-for-Purpose’ Approach to Tracking Progress on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience: Learning from Local Governments in Australia Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Local governments are at the forefront of responding to climate change in developing risk assessments and mitigation and adaptation strategies. In the Australian context, local government plans and strategies are emerging, however the extent to which municipalities are planning effectively for climate change and whether they are delivering on outcomes is difficult to assess. While there are a number of frameworks for monitoring, evaluating and reporting climate change adaptation and urban resilience, very few have been implemented at the local scale. This paper will present a case study from a group of councils in metropolitan Melbourne who have collaborated to develop a â€˜fit-for-purposeâ€™ framework to track how well they are adapting to climate change and to improve their resilience. The project process, framework design, indicators and pilot implementation phase will be outlined including an analysis of the challenges and issues that emerged in developing and implementing an approach to monitoring and evaluation. We seek to contribute to the gap in knowledge around â€˜doing adaptationâ€™ in particular how we can monitor and evaluate progress. In the post Paris climate policy context, much more attention is needed on how we can better understand the â€œactual experience of adaptationâ€ which broadly asks â€œare we adaptingâ€? (Ford and King in Mitig Adapt Strat Glob Change 20:505â€“526, 2015) and in the case of the particular Australian case study presented in this paper, the focus is on how can we assess â€˜How Well Are We Adapting?â€™."
"Disposal and recycle economic assessment for aircraft and engine end of life solution evaluation Planning; Disassembly; Design For Assembly The present study proposes an economic indicator to support the evaluation of aircraft End of Life (EoL) strategies in view of the increasing demand with regards to aircraft decommissioning. This indicator can be used to evaluate the economic performance and to facilitate the trade-off studies among different strategies. First, Disposal and Recycle (D&R) scenarios related to stakeholders are investigated to identify the core concepts for the economic evaluation. Next, we extracted the aircraft D&R process from various real-life practices. In order to obtain the economic measure for the engineering process, a method of estimating the D&R cost and values are developed by integrating product, process and cost properties. This analysis is demonstrated on an averaged data set and two EoL aircraft cases. In addition, sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of the D&R cost, residual value, and salvage value. Results show that the disassembly and dismantling of an aircraft engine possesses relatively more economic gains than that for the aircraft. The main factors influencing the proposed D&R economic indicator are the salvage value and D&R cost for economically efficient D&R cases. In addition, delaying the disposal and recycle process for EoL aircraft can lead to economically unfavorable solutions. The economic indicator combined with the evaluation methods is widely applicable for evaluations of engineering products EoL solutions, and implies a significant contribution of this research to decision making for such complex systems in terms sustainable policy."
"Influence of hole mobility on charge separation and recombination dynamics at lead halide perovskite and spiro-ometad interface Perovskite Solar Cells; Solar Cell; Formamidine High efficiency lead halide perovskite solar cells employ spiro-OMeTAD or PTAA as a hole transporting material. This type of hole conductor requires dopants mainly to improve hole mobility. Although such doping has improved solar cell performance, in particular open circuit photovoltage and fill factor, the mechanism of the improvement has rarely been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate influence of dopants in spiro-OMeTAD on interfacial charge separation and recombination processes for a MAPbI3 perovskite film sandwiched by an m-TiO2 film and a spiro-OMeTAD layer by employing a series of transient absorption spectroscopies. The interfacial charge recombination time was significantly retarded by the doping. We propose that the retardation of the charge recombination originates from relatively longer distance of holes from the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface owing to the increased hole mobility by the doping, potentially increasing Voc of the solar cell."
"Assessment Design for Interdisciplinary, Professional and Sustainability Education Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development This paper offers a situated micro-analysis of a major undergraduate assessment task within Sustainability Education, which exemplifies earlier work on the Higher Education Learning Design framework (HELD) as discussed in Holdsworth and Hegarty (J Clean Prod 122:176â€“185, 2016) and Hegarty and Holdsworth (Environ Dev Sustain 17:239â€“258, 2015). This assessment task, undertaken by students in multiple baccalaureate programs whose professional terrain is directly connectedâ€”that of construction managers, building developers and the urban planners who evaluate and approve development proposals in municipal and consultancy contexts. This paper presents the rationale for the assessment inception and design in the context of various imperatives. It also explores the situated experience of delivery of this assessment and our own reflection on the management of a complex assessment task. Student perspectives from the courses are also shared, drawing on external research undertaken on the learning and teaching experiences within both courses when the assessment was first implemented. Useful lessons for integrated, student-centred learning design, as proposed by the HELD model, are highlighted from this micro-analysis."
"What Drives Petrol Price Dispersion across Australian Cities? Price Dynamics; Price Dispersion; Asymmetric Pricing Petrol directly impacts the ability of and extent to which households can engage in day-to-day activities and ultimately directly influences the aggregate economic activity. Petrol price increases can lead to major economic disruption, especially among the most vulnerable, such as low-income families. In Australia, petrol prices differ substantially between metropolitan and regional areas, and regional drivers must pay more for purchasing petrol than those in capital cities. This research explored why retail petrol prices vary from one city to another within and between Australian regions. In this study, clustering methods and panel models will be used to identify factors that cause price differences. The findings revealed that a considerable part of the price differences arose from specific characteristics of cities that influence the demand and supply of petrol, thereby causing variations in price decisions. Petrol prices were substantially influenced by wholesale petrol prices, oil prices, petrol and diesel vehicles, population density, station density, and public transport accessibility. These factors are the main determinants that contribute significantly to price variations between Australian cities. The findings provide critical information for economic agents that interact in this market. From a social welfare perspective, government authorities can consider these factors to improve living standards and consumersâ€™ welfare under price pressure in regional cities."
"Labor market regulation under self-enforcing contracts Unemployment Insurance; Labour Market; Job Search This paper examines the effects of various labor market institutions (policies) on the welfare of workers and employers. We consider self-enforcing contracts between risk-averse workers and risk-neutral employers in a labor market with search frictions. Employers promise to smooth out shocks to wages while workers promise long-term commitment to employers. In this environment, regulatory policies can make it easier or harder for employers to keep their promise of wage smoothing, thus influencing the benefit accruing to each party. In our approach, we analyze the joint effect of policies by distinguishing between the financing and spending of funds used in the regulation of the labor market. With regard to financing, layoff tax strictly dominates hiring and payroll taxes on efficiency grounds, whereas the relative ranking of hiring and payroll taxes depend on the type of equilibrium that realizes. On the spending side, while unemployment payment increases workers' welfare at the expense of employers, in-work benefit in the form of a one-off wage subsidy leaves workers' welfare intact but may increase the welfare of employers."
"The Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture: Findings from Households in Vietnam Crops; CERES (Experiment); Climate Change Impact This paper examines farm household-level impacts of climate change by examining the relationship between climatic variables and Vietnamese agricultural output. The Ricardian technique is applied with panel data which accounts for both adaptation strategies and household characteristics. This study proposes a two-stage Hsiao model to correct for collinearity between climatic variables and individual effects. The results show that in the dry season, increases in temperatures are beneficial to all farms in the warmer southern regions, while increases in precipitation will damage only irrigated farms in the Central and South regions. The impact of higher temperature in the wet season is similar, except that it will negatively affect net revenue of irrigated farms in the long run. More rainfall in the wet season will increase net revenue in the North region only. Finally, this study combines the estimated results with future climate scenarios to predict how future changes in climate will affect farmers on aggregate."
"Family decision-making in an emerging market: Tensions with tradition Children's Rights; Childhood; Children with Disabilities We explore the role of the extended family on family decision-making in the context of a high-involvement purchase decision in an emerging economy. Adopting a grounded theory approach, we conducted 33 in-depth interviews with 11 families across Vietnam, including both nuclear and extended family members. Our findings demonstrate that parents retain a significant, albeit evolving, role in the consumption decision-making of their adult children, acting as a facilitator, cultural mentor and/or patriarch. However, these roles, coupled with the broader macro-environmental transformation, have contributed to two key tensions with tradition for the younger generation: respecting and deferring to their parents versus fulfilling their own aspirations fuelled by socio-economic change; and, for women in particular, achieving a greater voice in decision-making versus adhering to the culturally entrenched norms of a patriarchal society."
"Decentralization Reforms in Developing Countries Designed to Champion the Interests of Central Politicians and not Grassroots Development Fiscal Decentralization; Federalism; China Decentralization has been considered as a powerful tool for enhancing development. However, after nearly four decades of implementing decentralization in many countries in the Global South, the evidence suggests that the impact of decentralization on development is weak and uninspiring. This article argues that the design of a decentralization program is always critical with regard the extent to which it can promote development. The evidence across the developing countries demonstrates that the motivations behind decentralization are typically not politically neutral, political interests have been the key motivation behind the adoption of various types of decentralization programs in the developing countries. As a result, the faith in decentralization as a technical tool that could propel grassroots development needs to be reconsidered, since political interests and not development are the main determinants of decentralization. This is because, in practice, the decentralization designs in many developing countries tend to limit rather than expand the political, fiscal, and administrative powers of subnational governments, while the center retains control. This severely limits the development potential of subnational governments."
"Locus of control and energy poverty Locus of Control; Labour Market; Personality Traits We examine the impact of locus of control (LoC) on energy poverty. Using 15 waves of longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey and a supplementary dataset that collects information on household energy choices, we examine the direct effects of LoC on subjective and objective indicators of energy poverty. We also examine the role of savings, gambling behaviour, trust and household energy choices as potential channels through which LoC transmits to energy poverty. We find that being more internal on LoC is associated with a lower likelihood of being energy poor. Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in being more internal on LoC is associated with a 0.028 standard deviation decline in the probability of being energy poor as defined by the low-income high-cost measure of energy poverty and a 0.125 standard deviation decline in the probability that one is unable to heat their home. We find that savings, gambling behaviour, social capital and being proactive in installing energy-saving lighting and not leaving the lights on in the house throughout the day are channels through which LoC influences energy poverty."
"Integration of ultrafiltration membrane process with chemical coagulation for proficient treatment of old industrial landfill leachate Landfill Leachates; Leaching; Municipal Solid Waste Old industrial landfill leachate (OILL) poses a significant challenge to the environment, due to the large volumes of the solid waste directly discharged into landfills which leach out by percolation during rainfall and degradation of organic waste. Various separation processes have been used for the treatment of OILL to reduce environmental pollution. The innovation in the present study is the integration of membrane ultrafiltration (UF) process with chemical coagulation to remove pollutants such as total dissolved solids (TDS), conductivity, turbidity, and color from an OILL. Various coagulants such as ferric chloride (FeCl3), activated carbon (AC) and their combinations with alum ((Al(SO4)3) and lime (Ca(OH)2) were used to optimize pretreatment by coagulation. Experiments were conducted by varying the composition of coagulants and sedimentation time. Reduction in parametric values of TDS from 3200 to 1500 mg L-1, conductivity from 5.00 to 2.34 mS cmâˆ’1, turbidity from 226 to 1 FAU, color from 2930 to 10Pt-Co, and pH from 8.23 to 4.86 were achieved by a combination of coagulation by FeCl3 and UF membrane process. Moreover, greater removal of turbidity and color of 98.7% and 99.48%, respectively were observed. Further, the coagulation kinetics were established on the basis of the pH of the supernatant liquid through modeling using SMOLUCHOWSKI equation and observed to follow first-order kinetics. FeCl3 coagulant + UF was found capable of promoting maximum removal of color and turbidity compared to the other combinations. The integrated process exhibits advantages of small footprint of equipment used, economy, environmental safety, low energy consumption, and ease of scale-up for OILL treatment with simultaneous water reclamation of at least 70%."
"Nanoscale probing and imaging of HIV-1 RNA in cells with a chimeric LNA-DNA sensor Beacons; Threoninol; DNA Real-time detection and nanoscale imaging of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ribonucleic acid (HIV-1 RNA) in latently infected cells that persist in people living with HIV-1 on antiretroviral therapy in blood and tissue may reveal new insights needed to cure HIV-1 infection. Herein, we develop a strategy combining DNA nanotechnology and super-resolution expansion microscopy (ExM) to detect and image a 22 base sequence transcribed from the HIV-1 promoter in model live and fixed cells. We engineer a chimeric locked nucleic acid (LNA)-DNA sensor via hybridization chain reaction to probe HIV-1 RNA in the U3 region of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by signal amplification in live cells. We find that the viral RNA transcript of the U3 region of the HIV-1 LTR, namely PromA, is a valid and specific biomarker to detect infected live cells. The efficiency and selectivity of the LNA-DNA sensor are evaluated in combination with ExM. Unlike standard ExM methods, which rely on additional custom linkers to anchor and immobilize RNA molecules in the intracellular polymeric network, in the current strategy, we probe and image the HIV-1 RNA target at nanoscale resolution, without resorting to chemical linkers or additional preparation steps. This is achieved by physical entrapment of the HIV-1 viral transcripts in the cells post-expansion by finely tuning the mesh size of the intracellular polymeric network."
"Impact of electric propulsion technology and mission requirements on the performance of VTOL UAVs Helicopter; Air Mobility; Propellers One of the engineering challenges in aviation is the design of transitioning vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. Thrust-borne flight implies a higher mass fraction of the propulsion system, as well as much increased energy consumption in the take-off and landing phases. This mass increase is typically higher for aircraft with a separate lift propulsion system than for aircraft that use the cruise propulsion system to support a dedicated lift system. However, for a costâ€“benefit trade study, it is necessary to quantify the impact the VTOL requirement and propulsion configuration has on aircraft mass and size. For this reason, sizing studies are conducted. This paper explores the impact of considering a supplemental electric propulsion system for achieving hovering flight. Key variables in this study, apart from the lift system configuration, are the rotor disk loading and hover flight time, as well as the electrical systems technology level for both batteries and motors. Payload and endurance are typically used as the measures of merit for unmanned aircraft that carry electro-optical sensors, and therefore the analysis focuses on these particular parameters."
"Outlook for graphene-based desalination membranes Graphene Oxide; Nanofiltration Membranes; Graphite We discuss here next-generation membranes based on graphene for water desalination, based on the results of molecular simulations, application of nanofabrication technologies, and experiments. The potential of graphene to serve as a key material for advanced membranes comes from two major possible advantages of this atomically thin two-dimensional material: permeability and selectivity. Graphene-based membranes are also hypothetically attractive based on concentration polarization and fouling, and grapheneâ€™s chemical and physical stability. Further research is needed to fully achieve these theoretical benefits, however. In addition, improvement in the design and manufacturing processes, so to produce performance and cost-effective graphene-based desalination devices, is still an open question. Finally, membranes are only one part of desalination systems, and current processes are not optimized to take full advantage of the higher selectivity and permeability of graphene. New desalination processes are, therefore, needed to unlock the full benefits of graphene."
"Moving from the millennium to the sustainable development goals: Lessons and recommendations Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations Introduction With the introduction of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), perhaps the most important questions on the minds of most policymakers is whether the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were successful and what factors may have influenced their achievement. Answering these questions is important for assessing the ongoing progress of the SDGs and identifying key policy areas to focus on. This important edited collection examines various dimensions of the MDGs and development goals more generally, from socioeconomic factors to institutional, financial and more. The authors provide lessons and recommendations for attaining the Sutainable Development Goals that will be relevant to academics, development policymakers and practitioners, as well as NGOs, development agencies and students."
"Firm resources and the development of environmental sustainability among small and medium‐sized enterprises: Evidence from the australian wine industry Sustainability; Environmental Management Systems; Eco-Management and Audit Scheme Scholars and industry professionals want clarification of the specific firm resources that influence the adoption and development of environmentally sustainable strategies. This paper, set in the context of the Australian wine industry, explores different firm resources that are beneficial for environmentally sustainable development and examines the role of management attitudes and norms in moderating this relationship. It establishes which resources small and mediumâ€sized enterprises (SMEs) should invest in to be more successful in following environmental principles. The findings of a survey of the ownerâ€managers of Australian wineâ€producing SMEs are reported, and partial least squares structural equation modelling is utilized to analyze the data. Results clearly indicate that successful firms that manage their resources more effectively influence the application of environmental behaviour, with one distinct resource significantly influencing the disclosure of such behaviour. A moderating effect is established which supports the notion that proâ€environmental decisionâ€making in SMEs is heavily influenced by the attitudes and norms held by management."
"A qualitative study of the role of playgroups in building community capacity Early Childhood Education and Care; New Public Management; Recontextualization Issue addressed: Given that approximately half of all Australian families with children aged 2-3 years participate in playgroups, these settings may provide an important venue for social support and community capacity building. The aim of this study is to assess the benefits that parents and the wider community derive from such participation. Methods: We examined community capacity building opportunities through qualitative interviews conducted with a self-selected sample of 33 playgroup participants. All participants were the child's biological mother, and many had been involved in the playgroup committee of management, including 11 participants who were currently, or had previously been, a playgroup coordinator. Results: We found that playgroups act as key sites for building community capacity through developing community connections, skill building and creating leadership pathways. We found that playgroup committee participation was often women's first foray into community volunteering, and often translated into future community leadership, such as kindergarten committees of management and primary school councils. Conclusions: Community playgroups play a key role in building the capacity of communities and provide a vehicle for the development of new volunteers. So what?: Local governments, schools and other community organisations that rely on volunteer committees would benefit from providing support to community playgroups to foster future community leaders."
"Exploring the paradox: A cross-sectional study of academic dishonesty among Australian nursing students Academic Dishonesty; Plagiarism; Cheating Background: Universitiesâ€™ responsibility to ensure academic integrity is frustrated by software and communication tools that facilitate content reuse coupled with a growing international essay writing economy. A wide range of behaviours constitute academic dishonesty and while a complex phenomenon to examine, existing evidence suggests that there is sufficient proliferation (both in volume and variety) of these behaviours among Australian university students to warrant concern. This proliferation presents faculty and staff with new challenges in ensuring academic integrity. Objectives: This paper reports findings of a nationwide cross-sectional survey of 361 students enrolled in an Australian nursing degree program and describes the extent of academic dishonesty among those surveyed. Design: An online survey adapted from previous work was used to collect data on academic dishonesty, professional dishonesty and social desirability bias. Analysis of this data enabled identification of the prevalence of dishonesty, relationships between individual characteristics and dishonest behaviours, associations between academic and professional dishonesty, and the impact of deterrents to such behaviour. Results: Plagiarism was the most frequently reported form of academic misconduct. Most participants indicated that threat of severe punishment and signing of verification statements would deter undesirable academic behaviour. Despite this, a relatively high proportion of students reported engaging in at least one form of academic misconduct, the likelihood of which was higher among younger age groups. Of concern was that a correlation was found between academic and professional misconduct, the most common being the recording of inaccurate or fabricated vital signs and breaching client privacy. Conclusion: In health professional education, there is a tendency to assume that the nobility of these disciplines would result in a lower incidence of cheating behaviours. The findings of this study support existing literature that refutes this assumption. This study found troubling rates of academic and professional misconduct among the surveyed population."
"Are Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers Associated with Reductions in Poverty and Improvements in Well-being? Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations Should Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) be the tool for implementing the new Sustainable Development Goals, as they were for the Millennium Development Goals? Surprisingly, despite the controversies around them, there has never been a quantitative evaluation of PRSPs. This paper estimates the impact of having a PRSP on various targets of the Millennium Development Goals. Results suggest that countries under PRSP treatment achieve much greater reductions than control countries, in head count poverty and infant mortality, while also achieving greater improvements in primary school enrolments and gender parity."
"Options for Improved Treatment of Saline Wastewater From Fish and Shellfish Processing Activated Sludge; Batch Reactors; Salinity The rapid growth of the aquaculture industry over recent decades, with annual production reaching 94.6 million tonnes in 2018 has resulted in a significant increase in saline wastewater following the use of seawater in both fish and shellfish production and processing. This wastewater contains high concentrations of nutrients, organic compounds, and total nitrogen, resulting in the requirement for significant treatment prior to discharge to meet environmental regulations, which are becoming more stringent. The infrastructure and running costs associated with physico-chemical treatment approaches are generally higher than the implementation of biological approaches; the latter represents both an economic and sustainable technology. However, salinity represents a significant inhibitor to microbial activity, affecting the efficacy of the biological treatment of wastewater. This review aims to 1) identify the major biodegradable components in saline fish wastewater that may result in deleterious effects upon discharge, 2) discuss the current methods used for the treatment of fish processing wastewaters, and 3) identify opportunities for improved processes to be utilised and identify gaps in knowledge that require further research. Total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total nitrogen (TN) were found to be the most prevalent components in fish effluent. High concentrations of TSS and TN are likely due to the protein content. One method for reducing the environmental impact of the treated wastewater is to enhance nutrient removal (TSS, TN, BOD) through process modification, leading to an increase in active proteolytic activity. Bioaugmentation using immobilised, saline-tolerant proteases or halophilic, protease-producing microorganisms have both shown significant potential in laboratory studies in reducing both the COD and TN content of fish processing wastewater to below discharge limits and therefore may represent commercial options for future treatment processes."
"How positive service experiences contribute to service captivity Debt; Personal Finance; Credit Cards Purpose: Service captivity is described as the experience of constrained choice whereby a consumer has no power and feels unable to exit a service relationship. This study aims to explore how positive service experiences can contribute to service captivity in the alternative financial services (AFS) sector for consumers experiencing financial vulnerability. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 31 interviews were undertaken with Australian consumers of payday loans and/or consumer leases. Findings: The authors reveal a typology of consumers based on their financial vulnerability and their experience with AFS providers. Then they present three themes relating to how the marketing practices of these providers create a positive service experience, and, in doing so, can contribute to service captivity for consumers experiencing financial vulnerability. Research limitations/implications: The benefits derived from positive service experiences, including accessible solutions, self-esteem, and a sense of control over their financial situation, contribute to the service captivity of some consumers, rendering alternative avenues less attractive. Practical implications: AFS providers must ensure a socially responsible approach to their marketing practices to minimize potentially harmful outcomes for consumers. However, a systems-level approach is needed to tackle the wider issue of financial precarity. Policymakers need to address the marketplace gaps, regulatory frameworks and social welfare policies that contribute to both vulnerability and captivity. Originality/value: This research extends the understanding of service captivity by demonstrating how positive service experiences can perpetuate this situation. Further, specific solutions are proposed at each level of the service system to address service captivity in the AFS sector."
"A Reading Group for Science Educators: an Approach for Developing Personal and Collective Pedagogical Content Knowledge in Science Education Noticing; Content Knowledge; Professional Vision Reading, at its core, is a basic yet critical way to undertake learning and growth. This paper shares a professional learning and development initiative for science educators, which was underpinned by the popularity and premise of the reading group. In moving from simply being a vehicle for targeted discussion, the reading group facilitators sought to support the participants in taking a deeper dive into their practice with the impact ultimately being changes to their personal pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) for science. This small-scale qualitative study was informed by the voices of three science educators at different stages and career trajectories, who participated in interviews. The data revealed that their participation in the reading group informed the development of their personal and collective PCK by (a) creating conditions that encouraged meaningful links to be made between theory and practice, (b) encouraging the adoption of an inquiry stance as a means for engaging purposively with professional knowledge, and (c) initiating a transformation in their contemporary understandings of science and science education. By drawing on the participantsâ€™ narratives, this study brings to the fore both the simplicity and depth of complexity that can be achieved through a reading group focused on professional learning and development. The implications of this research are wide reaching as the reading group as a concept can be applied to a variety of contexts and shaped to reach a variety of educational needs."
"Mapping insoluble indole metabolites in the gastrointestinal environment of a murine colorectal cancer model using desorption/ionisation on porous silicon imaging Coloring Agent; Natural Dyes; Hexaplex Trunculus Indole derivatives are a structurally diverse group of compounds found in food, toxins, medicines, and produced by commensal microbiota. On contact with acidic stomach conditions, indoles undergo condensation to generate metabolites that vary in solubility, activity and toxicity as they move through the gut. Here, using halogenated ions, we map promising chemo-preventative indoles, i) 6-bromoisatin (6Br), ii) the mixed indole natural extract (NE) 6Br is found in, and iii) the highly insoluble metabolites formed in vivo using desorption/ionisation on porous silicon-mass spectrometry imaging (DIOS-MSI). The functionalised porous silicon architecture allowed insoluble metabolites to be detected that would otherwise evade most analytical platforms, providing direct evidence for identifying the therapeutic component, 6Br, from the mixed indole NE. As a therapeutic lead, 0.025 mg/g 6Br acts as a chemo-preventative compound in a 12 week genotoxic mouse model; at this dose 6Br significantly reduces epithelial cell proliferation, tumour precursors (aberrant crypt foci; ACF); and tumour numbers while having minimal effects on liver, blood biochemistry and weight parameters compared to controls. The same could not be said for the NE where 6Br originates, which significantly increased liver damage markers. DIOS-MSI revealed a large range of previously unknown insoluble metabolites that could contribute to reduced efficacy and increased toxicity."
"Trends in wheat yields under representative climate futures: Implications for climate adaptation Crops; Break Crops; Farming Systems Underestimating the impacts of climate change on agricultural production could lead to complacency about the potential adaptation challenges. This study used a Representative Climate Futures (RCF) approach to model projected wheat yields under climate change in Australia. It simulated the range of impacts, resulting from a subset of individual Global Climate Models (GCMs), on wheat production in the major wheat regions of Australia. The study used RCFs that represented â€˜most-likelyâ€™ â€˜bestâ€™ and â€˜worstâ€™ cases across multiple Representative Concentration pathways (RCPs). Median wheat yields modelled for the South West Australia projected declines between 26% and 38%, under a â€˜most-likelyâ€™ case for RCP 4.5 by 2090, and between 41% and 49%, under a â€˜most-likelyâ€™ case for RCP 8.5. Median wheat yields declined under RCP 8.5 for the â€˜most-likelyâ€™ case across the majority of wheat producing regions, with a range of 1% to 49%. Greater declines were projected under the â€˜worstâ€™ cases of hottest and driest climates. However, the â€˜bestâ€™ cases of least warm and wetter climates projected an increase in median wheat yield, a range of 2% to 87%. Variability also changed from the baseline under all projected RCFs and across all regions, with a standard deviation of up to 2.46 t/ha under the â€˜most likelyâ€™ case at a site in south-eastern Australia. These likely shifts in the size and reliability of yields, combined with concurrent climate change impacts on other factors, mean that agriculture faces significant adaptation challenges, particularly under some of the â€˜most-likelyâ€™ scenarios and all of the â€˜worstâ€™ case scenarios. Further work is required to explore how scenarios in one region relate to those in other regions and thus the overall outcome at the continental scale."
"Aiming for mediocrity: The case of australian housing thermal performance Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Concerns about climate change, energy security and energy productivity are driving countries to improve energy and thermal efficiency of their housing. Australia established a Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS) in the mid-1990s to encourage improved energy performance, before regulating minimum energy standards in the 2000s. While minimum standards in Australia have improved, they fall short of requirements for a low carbon future. Resistance to new standards has been predicated on the argument that consumers will drive the market. Others argue that market failures result in lower than optimal house energy performance. There has been limited investigation of this in the Australian context. This paper analyses over 187,000 NatHERS certificates from 2016 to 2018 to determine the response to market desires and the regulatory environment. The research finds 81.7% of housing is designed only to meet minimum standards, and 98.5% falls below the economic and environmental optimum. This demonstrates significant market failure and indicates that building energy regulation is a powerful instrument for delivering improved performance outcomes. If governments are seeking a larger contribution from the housing sector to carbon abatement and other energy policies, systematically raising minimum building energy regulations is probably the most important and effective mechanism."
"Trade-off between Technical Airworthiness and Operating Costs Study Based on B737 MAX MCAS System Failures Fluidics; Circulation Control Airfoils; Lift Augmentation Airborne software is invisible, intangible, and unlike the physical structures of the aircraft, which can be inspected, measured, and thoroughly tested. Given that airborne software can significantly impact the safety of the aircraft, its abnormal behaviours may cause the aircraft to be in a catastrophic failure condition. This essay studied the trade-off between technical airworthiness and operating costs based on B737 MAX MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) failures. The key aspects of 737 Max Accidents are identified and analyzed. It could be concluded that the airborne software was not the root cause of MCAS failure, the software correctly implemented the requirements allocated from the system, however, there was design flaws in the system design architecture and safety assessment process mainly due to the pressure of competition and the pursuit of profit."
"FinTech: Harnessing Innovation for Financial Inclusion New Product Development; Fuzzy Front End; Innovation The landscape of financial inclusion has for long been considered as the soft side of financial services, having received scarce attention from a financial, regulatory, and policy point of view, despite its central role within the global economic empowerment. Part of the disadvantaged and low-income segments of global population is left without (i.e. financially excluded) or very limited access (i.e. financially underserved) to basic financial services, creating a highly critical equality deficit in different parts of the world. In this frame of reference, financial exclusion still remains a highly critical problem that hinders developing regions around the world from eradicating poverty leading to large-scale starvation and civil unrest. Moreover, financial exclusion is interwoven with social dependency making financially excluded/underserved populations strongly dependable on their social networks. The emergence of FinTech, the new breed between financial innovation and financial technology, which has been challenging the prevailing position of incumbent financial institutions, is providing a promising vehicle of tackling this phenomenon by closing the gap between unbanked, under-banked and developed societies, opening the door to the global digital economy, bringing a long-term societal transformational change for the financially excluded/underserved, while leading to inclusive economic growth helping move towards a more just and equitable society."
"Examining the relationship between urban liveability and gender-based violence: A systematic review. Alcohol Drinking; Underage Drinking; Neighborhood Characteristics Gender-based violence can include, but is not limited to, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, rape, and intimate partner homicide. It is well-established that gender inequality is the main driver of gender-based violence. However, little work has attempted to unpack how gender-based violence perpetuates within the neighbourhood context, and whether â€˜liveabilityâ€™ attributes might intersect with gender inequality and violence. We systematically reviewed quantitative evidence examining associations between gender-based violence and several liveability neighbourhood-level factors. MEDLINE (Ovid) and Scopus databases yielded 1822 potentially relevant articles. 50 articles met inclusion criteria. Neighbourhood social capital was most consistently associated with reduced gender-based violence. Few studies examined built environment attributes (e.g. gambling venue densities, access to services). Future research is needed to more deeply examine how combinations of salutogenic or pathogenic neighbourhood attributes may reinforce or prevent violence."
"A Methodological Framework for Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment of Construction Projects Incorporating TBL and Decoupling Principles Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building The triple bottom line (TBL) principle encompasses the idea of continued economic and social well-being with minimal or reduced environmental pressure. However, in construction projects, the integration of social, economic, and environmental dimensions from the TBL perspective remains challenging. Green building rating tools/schemes, such as Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA), Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED), Building Research Establishment Environment Assessment (BREEAM), and their criteria, which serve as a yardstick in ensuring sustainability based practices and outcomes, are also left wanting. These green building rating tools/schemes not only fail to comprehensively evaluate the three dimensions (social, economic, and environment) and interaction therewith, but also lack in capturing a life cycle approach towards sustainability. Therefore, this study intends to address the aforementioned challenges. The first part of this study presents the concept of sustainable construction as a system of well-being decoupling and impact decoupling. Findings in the first part of this study provide a rationale for developing a methodological framework that not only encapsulates a TBL based life cycle approach to sustainability assessment in construction, but also evaluates interactions among social and economic well-being, and environmental pressure. In methodological framework development, two decoupling indices were developed, namely, the phase well-being decoupling index (PWBDIK ) and phase impact decoupling index (PIDIK ). PWBDIK and PIDIK support the evaluation of interdependence among social and economic well-being, and the environmental pressure associated with construction projects in different life cycle phases. The calculation underpinning the proposed framework was illustrated using three hypothetical cases by adopting criteria from GRIHA Precertification and GRIHA v.2019 schemes. The results of these cases depict how the interactions among different dimensions (social, economic, and environment) vary as they move from one phase to another phase in a life cycle. The methodological framework developed in this study can be tailored to suit the sustainability assessment requirements for different phases and typologies of construction in the future."
"Concrete recycling life cycle flows and performance from construction and demolition waste in Hanoi Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management As construction increases through a rise in development in Vietnam, the environmental performance of recycling construction and demolition waste is not well documented. This paper addresses this lack of knowledge, by mapping the current recycling system and estimating recycling performance of a key component in construction and demolition waste in Vietnam, concrete. Primary data were collected directly from six Vietnamese construction enterprises involved in the life cycle of construction and demolition waste management. The results indicated that potential net environmental benefits exist for all impact categories examined if a mechanised plant were considered. Moreover, construction demolition waste may then be used for more permanent applications such as building foundations and in new building materials. The results confirm benefits to technological advancements in concrete recycling in the construction demolition waste sector. Fostering investment and interest in such strategies could be achieved by imposing clear and consistent construction demolition waste classifications, establishing clear lines of responsibility, and coordinating activities amongst key stakeholders to promote the benefits of concrete recycling. These findings consolidate the need of further research in Vietnam and other developing nations, where more detailed life cycle inventory development and stakeholder engagement could help. Then better environmental outcomes through the concrete recycling management may be delivered."
"On being posthuman in human spaces: critical posthumanist social work with interspecies families Animal Assisted Therapy; Service Dogs; Animals Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes a critical posthumanist orientation to social work as an approach to address the impediments to care experienced by interspecies families. Secondly, it challenges the anthropocentric assumptions that underpin this exclusion of nonhuman family members in human services disciplines such as social work. Design/methodology/approach: This article presents primary data from a qualitative study into social work and other human services practice in the family violence and homelessness sectors in the state of Victoria, Australia. Findings: Social workers undertook companion animal-inclusive practice to counter vulnerability to interspecies families caused by gender- and species-based violence, and by homelessness. Gender- and species-based violence was exacerbated by a lack of refuge options, and contributed to women considering their companion animals to be their children. The vulnerability that homelessness brought upon interspecies families was amplified by stigma within and external to social work and related professions, and the impediment that experiences of homelessness had on being able to provide care for their nonhuman family members. These factors shaped practice with interspecies families. Scope for future practice was also identified. Research limitations/implications: The research findings can be used to inform policy change that includes consideration of nonhuman family members, as well as critical posthuman program design in social work education. Originality/value: Companion animal-inclusive practice with interspecies families in social work is an under researched area, and there is little empirical data available on the nature of this work in Australia. This paper addresses this gap by centring social workers' own accounts of practice. This paper has scope to contribute to education in social work and other welfare fields, with the potential to empower students to challenge assumptions about social work being solely focused on human-centred concerns."
"Improving sensing of formaldehyde using ZnO nanostructures with surface-adsorbed oxygen Gas Sensor; Acetone; Sensing Detection of pollutant gases, such as formaldehyde (HCHO), in our homes and surrounding environment is of high importance for our health and safety. The effect of surface defects and specifically pre-adsorbed oxygen on the gas sensing reaction of HCHO with ZnO nanostructures is largely unknown. Using density functional theory, nonequilibrium Green's function method and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we show that the presence of surface oxygen has two key roles in the sensitivity of ZnO towards HCHO: (1) it leads to the presence of charge trap states, which vanish upon the adsorption of HCHO, and (2) it facilitates the dissociative chemisorption of HCHO on the surface. Our ground state and AIMD calculations show that multiple reaction products are produced, which eventually lead to cleaning the surface from the adsorbed species, and hence enhancing the recyclability of the surface. We not only confirm the reaction proposed by experiment, but show that the presence of surface oxygen facilitates other surface reactions as well. Our work provides insights into the gas-surface reaction mechanism of ZnO-nanostructure based gas sensors, not provided before by experiment."
"Sustainable water management and improved corporate reporting in mining Decision Making; Export Earnings; Mines The advent of corporate sustainability reporting and water accounting standards has resulted in increased disclosure of water use by mining companies. However, there has been limited compilation and analysis of these disclosures. To address this, we compiled a database of 8314 data points from 359 mining company reports, classified according to mining industry water accounting guidelines. The quality of disclosures is shown to have improved considerably over time. Although, opportunities still exist to improve reporting practices, such as by ensuring that all relevant water flows are reported and to explicitly state non-existent flows (e.g. discharges). Initial data analysis reveals considerable variability in water withdrawals, use efficiency and discharges between mining operations. Further work to improve industry coverage and to analyse the influence of mine specific factors such as ore processing methods and local climate will provide insights into the interactions of mining and water resources at a global scale."
"Temporal and spatial variations of microplastics in roadside dust from rural and urban Victoria, Australia: Implications for diffuse pollution Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Microplastic pollution is an important issue for environmental management as their ubiquity in marine and freshwaters has been confirmed. Pollution sources are key to understanding how microplastics travel from land to open oceans. Given that information regarding microplastic transport from diffuse sources is limiting, we conducted a study on roadside dust from rural and urban Victoria, Australia, over two seasons. Any deposited fugitive dust and particulate matter may also be present in our samples. The average microplastic abundance over two seasons ranged from 20.6 to 529.3 items/kg (dry weight based), with a predominant portion of fibers and items less than 1 mm. Polyester and polypropylene were the dominant polymer types (26%) while cotton and cellulose were the most common non-plastic items (27%). Sampling sites displayed consistent microplastic abundances over time and shared similar patterns in size, shape and polymer composition. Multiple correlation and principal component analysis suggest that urbanization and rainfall are important influences to roadside microplastic accumulation. The observed microplastic hotspots were generally located within close vicinity of areas where urban intensive land use and regional population sizes are high. Microplastics accumulated on roads and road verges during periods of dry weather and were flushed away during heavy storms while the corresponding trigger value was unknown. Monitoring roadside dust can be considered as an initial and cost-effective screening of microplastic pollution in urban areas. Further efforts should be made to optimize the methodologies and we advocate prolonged sampling schemes for roadside dust monitoring. Urbanization and weather conditions are major factors to microplastic accumulation by roadsides."
"Benevolent and hostile sexism differentially predicted by facets of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation Social Dominance Orientation; Authoritarianism; Political Attitudes Despite progress towards equality on many fronts, sexism remains a problem. If sexism is to be combatted, an understanding of the attitudes underlying its various expressions is required. Previous research has strongly linked sexism to right-wing authoritarianism (a preference for collective security) and social dominance orientation (a preference for group-based hierarchy). Both are often considered unitary constructs, however recent attention to their facets has revealed finer details. This study breaks ground by utilising these facets to predict benevolent sexism (paternalistic attitudes towards women) and hostile sexism (antipathy towards women) in an Australian sample (N = 229). Both sexism variables were significantly predicted by two of the five attitude facets. For benevolent sexism, these were traditionalism and dominance, and for hostile sexism, they were conservatism and anti-egalitarianism. Hostile sexism was also predicted by gender. These findings add to the theoretical understanding of ambivalent sexism, have implications for addressing sexism in society, and support calls for future research to utilise the facets of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation."
"A Generic Framework of Unifying Industrial By-products for Soil Stabilization Soil Cement; Compressive Strength; Calcium Carbide This paper presents a newly proposed generic framework for unifying different industrial by-products (IBPs) as composite binders to potentially replace ordinary Portland cement (OPC) for soft clay stabilization. The concepts of three chemical moduli (TCM) and strength activity index (SAI) are used to determine the fractions of different IBPs, and the final design mix is further tuned by adding gypsum for additional strength gain contributed by density due to ettringite formation. As a case study, a coastal soft clay was stabilized by different IBPs and gypsum using the new generic framework. Results show that the highest unconfined compression strengths of the IBPs stabilized clay cured for 7, 28, and 60 days reach 0.75, 1.21, and 1.39 MPa, respectively, which are even higher than those of the OPC-stabilized counterparts, suggesting the possibility of using IBPs to substitute OPC. Moreover, the additive gypsum plays a beneficial role for more strength gain due to the formation and volumetric expansion of ettringite. The implementation strategy for the new framework is recommended, and its practical implications for soil stabilization are discussed in terms of IBPs recycling and reuse, environmental sustainability, and economic benefits."
"Treatment of anthraquinone dye textile wastewater using anaerobic dynamic membrane bioreactor: Performance and microbial dynamics Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling The performance and microbial community structure of anaerobic dynamic membrane bioreactor (AnDMBR) treating textile wastewater was investigated. The reactor showed excellent soluble COD and color removal of 98.5% and >97.5%, respectively. Dynamic membrane layer grown over the 3D printed dynamic membrane support showed decent rejection for high molecular weight compounds (>20 kDa); and the total suspended solid rejection by the dynamic layer was >98.8%. Gel permeation chromatography analysis of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and effluent samples revealed EPS accounted for more than 76.7% of low molecular weight fractions (<20 kDa) that end up in the effluent. Higher applied flux facilitated the rapid formation dynamic layer which enabled a satisfactory effluent quality. Microbial community analysis revealed that during the operation the archaeal community was relatively stable while obvious changes took place in the bacterial community. Introduction of dye Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) to the AnDMBR increased the abundances of phyla of Proteobacteria and Spirochaetae whereas fractions of Firmicutes and Euryarchaeota decreased obviously. Furthermore, relative stable abundances of phyla Aminicenantes, Bacteroidetes, Thermotogae and Chloroflexi among the top six phyla detected in the system ensured a healthy anaerobic degradation environment for RBBR wastewater treatment."
"Elastomeric microvalve geometry affects haemocompatibility Lateral; Cell Separation; Lab-on-a-chip Devices This paper reports on the parameters that determine the haemocompatibility of elastomeric microvalves for blood handling in microfluidic systems. Using a comprehensive investigation of blood function, we describe a hierarchy of haemocompatibility as a function of microvalve geometry and identify a ""normally-closed"" v-gate pneumatic microvalve design that minimally affects blood plasma fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor composition, minimises effects on erythrocyte structure and function, and limits effects on platelet activation and aggregation, while facilitating rapid switching control for blood sample delivery. We propose that the haemodynamic profile of valve gate geometries is a significant determinant of platelet-dependent biofouling and haemocompatibility. Overall our findings suggest that modification of microvalve gate geometry and consequently haemodynamic profile can improve haemocompatibility, while minimising the requirement for chemical or protein modification of microfluidic surfaces. This biological insight and approach may be harnessed to inform future haemocompatible microfluidic valve and component design, and is an advance towards lab-on-chip automation for blood based diagnostic systems."
"Dwelling justice: locating settler relations in research and activism on stolen land Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness There is a general consensus now in Australia that we are in the grip of a severe housing crisis. The characteristics of spiralling housing costs and deepening precarity are unfolding in a context of the systematic managed decline of public housing as a critical social infrastructure, such that the capacity to make and find â€˜homeâ€™ is thinning every day. Yet in a settler-colony, such as Australia, the struggle against housing injustice is set inside an already violent relationship of un-homing that creates the very conditions for others to make home. Reckoning with this monstrous dilemma, of the politics of dwelling justice on stolen land, is the focus of this essay, which springs from our own experience and failure to fully comprehend the ways that our housing research and activism works to reinforce settler colonial logics of dwelling on stolen land."
"A sustainable approach on the utilisation of COVID-19 plastic based isolation gowns in structural concrete Environmental Pollution; Medical Waste; COVID-19 Single-use isolation gowns have become an important practice across medical centres, testing sites, and emergency rooms since the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic; within the later months of 2019. Although reusable isolation gowns have proved beneficial, 80% of frontline centres opt for disposable isolation gowns, increasing the demand for plastic-based personal protective equipment (PPE) and the environmental strain from excess waste in landfills. This research aims to explore the practicability of using plastic-based isolation gowns in structural concrete to scale back the quantity of pandemic-generated waste ending up in landfills. The shredded isolation gowns were added to aggregates at 0.01%, 0.02%, and 0.03% of the volume of concrete. The effects of various concentrations of shredded isolation gowns on the mechanical properties of the concrete were investigated through a series of experiments alongside an SEM-EDS analysis. Results demonstrate an enhanced bridging effect between the cement matrix and shredded isolation gowns, allowing for the steady trend of improved mechanical properties with increases of 15.5%, 20.6%, and 11.73% across compressive strength, flexural strength, and the modulus of elasticity, respectively."
"Support for social entrepreneurs from disadvantaged areas navigating crisis: Insights from Brazil Social Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Impact Investing When a socioeconomic crisis arises in an emerging economy, it highlights structural social issues facing the country and disproportionally impacts those from disadvantaged areas. Social entrepreneurship may be important as part of the solution to overcome this situation. However, it is often privileged individuals who engage in social entrepreneurship to tackle the problems of those who are disadvantaged. To enable social entrepreneurship in disadvantaged areas, we argue that it is instrumental to overcome a lack of at least three capitals: economic, human, and social and to craft enabling ecosystems. This rapid response paper explores how intermediary organizations might support and foster social entrepreneurs from disadvantaged areas. We discuss challenges and opportunities drawing on insights from micro and macro level perspectives in the entrepreneurship literature and from the challenges faced by ANIP, an organization which brings together actors from different sectors to develop social entrepreneurship in disadvantaged areas of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil."
"The responsibility to protect and the protection of civilians in UN peace operations: Interaction, feedback and co-evolution Humanitarian Intervention; First International; Ethnic Cleansing This chapter analyses the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) in conjunction with the Protection of Civilians (POC) in peace operations. It examines where and how the two concepts have challenged, altered, led to reinterpretations and had feedback effects on each other. It does so through an examination of their: gradual institutionalization at the UN; deployment in the practices of the Security Council; and, influence over the actions of operations in the field. The analysis shows that the R2P has been in a co-evolution with POC and particularly the implementation of POC through UN peace operations. The chapter argues that the emergence of the R2P and the trends in POC in peace operations have cross-fertilized in discourse and practice at the UN regarding the prevention and response to egregious of human rights abuses. It argues that this has influenced the respective trajectories of the two concepts with ramifications for understanding the normative trajectory and status of the R2P as it enters its third decade in popular lexicon. In particular, it posits that the R2Pâ€™s normative status is more accurately depicted as a bundle of norms that intersect with, and sometimes rely on other norms, regimes and agendas."
"Young precariat and a new work order? A case for historical sociology Student Mobility; International Students; Youth Labour Market This article assesses Guy Standing's (2011) account of â€˜the precariatâ€™ as a â€˜new class' to the many exercises undertaken in youth studies since the 1980s to make sense of the changing patterns of youth employment. While Standing's focus on the experience of fragmented and casualized work in many economies which now implicates young people has value, there are significant problems with his account that highlights the some difficulties in thinking in somewhat abstracted ways about â€˜structuralâ€™ change processes that do not sufficiently consider the question of time. The case of Australia's of labour market regulation since the 1890s is used to test the validity of Standing's focus on the novelty of neoliberalism after the early 1980 to explain the emergence of precarious employment. Standing's claim that insecurity is central to the â€˜new precariatâ€™ because they lack the different kinds of security enjoyed by the â€˜working-classâ€™ after 1945, highlights the need for an interpretative framework attentive to the longer term role of state policy and the interplay of historical and local processes. The case is then made for developing a historical sociology that engages with what is now happening in respect to young people and their employment security."
"Impact damage tolerance of energy storage composite structures containing lithium-ion polymer batteries Carbon Fibers; Electrochemical Capacitors; Battery Multifunctional composite structures that combine high load-bearing properties with electrical energy storage capacity have potential application in electric and hybrid powered cars, and therefore must be impact resistant in the event of collision. This paper examines the effect of low velocity impact on the damage, compression properties and energy storage capacity of composite laminates and sandwich composites containing an embedded lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery. The impact responses of a carbon fibre-reinforced epoxy (CFRP) laminate and a polymer foam core sandwich composite are investigated. The materials were impacted at different incident energy levels at the location immediately above the embedded battery. The battery at the impact location increased the impact energy absorption of both the laminate and sandwich composite due to its capacity to yield and plastically deform. Impact-induced damage reduced the compressive properties of the composite laminate and sandwich composite in part due to deformation, cracking and debonding of the battery. Low impact energy events (â‰¤4 J) had negligible effect on the residual energy storage capacity of the LiPo battery, although higher energies (â‰¥6 J) caused an internal short circuit due to excessive plastic deformation and crushing."
"Differential evolution of antiretroviral restriction factors in pteropid bats as revealed by APOBEC3 gene complexity AICDA (Activation-induced Cytidine Deaminase); Cytidine Deaminase; DNA Bats have attracted attention in recent years as important reservoirs of viruses deadly to humans and other mammals. These infections are typically nonpathogenic in bats raising questions about innate immune differences that might exist between bats and othermammals. The APOBEC3 gene family encodes antiviral DNA cytosine deaminases with important roles in the suppression of diverse viruses and genomic parasites. Here, we characterize pteropid APOBEC3 genes and show that species within the genus Pteropus possess the largest and most diverse array of APOBEC3 genes identified in any mammal reported to date. Several bat APOBEC3 proteins are antiviral as demonstrated by restriction of retroviral infectivity using HIV-1 as a model, and recombinant A3Z1 subtypes possess strong DNA deaminase activity. These genes represent the first group of antiviral restriction factors identified in bats with extensive diversification relative to homologues in other mammals."
"Policy-Relevant Spatial Indicators of Urban Liveability And Sustainability: Scaling From Local to Global Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Urban liveability is a global priority for creating healthy, sustainable cities. Measurement of policy-relevant spatial indicators of the built and natural environment supports city planning at all levels of government. Analysis of their spatial distribution within cities, and impacts on individuals and communities, is crucial to ensure planning decisions are effective and equitable. This paper outlines challenges and lessons from a 5-year collaborative research program, scaling up a software workflow for calculating a composite indicator of urban liveability for residential address points across Melbourne, to Australiaâ€™s 21 largest cities, and further extension to 25 global cities in diverse contexts."
"Un-braiding deficit discourse in Indigenous education news 2008–2018: performance, attendance and mobility Numeracy; Education Policy; Literacy This article presents a time sensitive critical text analysis of Australian news reporting that has identified, mapped and analysed news reporting about Indigenous education from 2008 to 2018. Three key themes were identified: school attendance; performance as measured by national testing, and boarding school education. A braiding metaphor is introduced to illustrate how the three themes operated independently over time, intersected and together wove a discursive braid steeped in deficit. The analysis is an act of â€˜unbraidingâ€™ that aims to reveal how news media coverage was integral to constructing Indigenous education as an unquestioned problem for society, a policy problem for governments to solve and an intractable pedagogical conundrum."
"Assessing the Impact of Wind Conditions on Urban Heat Islands in Large Australian Cities Heat Islands; Land Surface Temperature; Land Cover Urban regions are well known to be warmer than the outlying surrounding regions: this phenomenon is termed an Urban Heat Island (UHI). Depending upon its severity, an UHI can influence human health, the condition of urban vegetation, as well as air and water quality leading to a general decline in the living conditions of the affected urban environments and residents. Some studies have shown that prevailing weather conditions, like wind patterns, can influence UHI magnitudes. These studies suggest that wind speeds may be inversely related to UHI magnitude. However, long-term and high frequency weather and temperature measurements are exceedingly rare, so the exact nature of the relationship between wind speeds and directions as well as UHI magnitudes remain unknown. In order to address this problem, this study investigates how UHI magnitudes in five Australian cities affect wind speed and wind direction. The results of this study revealed that urbanâ€“non-urban temperature differences are most pronounced under calm weather conditions. The UHI intensity weakened as wind velocity increased: strong significant negative correlations were found between the mean UHI intensity and mean wind speed magnitudes. The results show that the greatest UHI intensities are recorded when wind is weak (less than 2 ms-1), while the lowest magnitudes are found when wind speeds exceed 6 ms-1. Further, the results show that the critical wind speed value, above which the strength of the UHI is considerably minimized, is around 4â€“5 ms-1. In addition, the study shows that wind direction in each city is a critical driver factor that determines the intensity of the UHI effect. When winds originate from dry environments, they favour high UHI intensities at all wind speeds, while the winds from the ocean side of coastal cities tend to cool urban regions, reducing UHI intensities or even promoting the urban cool island formation."
"Life cycle assessment to compare the environmental impact of seven contemporary food waste management systems Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste Municipal food waste (FW) represents 35â€“45% of household residual waste in Australia, with the nation generating 1.6 Tg annually. It is estimated that 91% of this FW ends up in landfill. This study used life cycle assessment to determine and compare the environmental impact of seven contemporary FW management systems for two real-life jurisdictions; incorporating the complete waste service and expanding the system to include inert and garden waste. Although, no system exhibited a best ranking across all impact categories, FW digestion based systems were all revealed to have a lower global warming potential than composting and landfilling systems. Mechanical biological treatment, anaerobic co-digestion, and home composting all demonstrated the lowest environmental impacts for two or more of the environmental impact categories assessed. The assessment included market and technological specific variables and uncertainties providing a framework for robust decision making at a municipality level."
"Social Work and the Sustainable Development Goals: A Student Placement Model Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations The United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a blueprint to address urgent global challenges, with a clear role for social workers. This paper explores a Sustainable Development Goalâ€™s focused student placement at the Australian Association of Social Workers, with RMIT University. Students reviewed the AASWâ€™s policy actions and their contribution to the SDGs, including recommendations for future work. The review identified advocacy in key areas, and the need for action on several issues, including climate action. Students learned about social work policy, practice, and sustainability. The placement itself provides a model for other organisations to align their actions to the SDGs. IMPLICATIONS There is a need for greater social work engagement with the United Nationsâ€™ SDGs to address urgent social and environmental challenges. Field education placements can provide an important opportunity for students to learn about sustainability, social work policy practice, and the SDGs. The placement model proposed in the article is suitable for any organisation that seeks to review their actions and better align their work to the SDGs."
"Bearing worlds: learning to live-with climate change Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Climate Change; Skepticism This paper explores the emotional experiences of some undergraduate sustainability students in a semester long course on climate change. Specifically, it attends to experiences of anxiety, frustration, overwhelm, guilt, grief and hope. I suggest these experiences are characteristic of a process I term learning to live-with climate change. Learning to live-with climate change involves attuning to the relational composition of the world and thus the self; mourning desirable relationships that are lost as the planet warms; and responding to these conditions in ways that may foster more liveable worlds. Collectively, these processes enrol people in practices of bearing worlds: enduring the pain of the end of the world they have known, and labouring to generate promising alternatives. As such, these processes reconfigure the self and its relations, and attunement to how climate change composes, recomposes and decomposes particular subjectivities is important. The paper argues that affective adaptation is therefore a crucial element of climate change education."
"Digitalizing agriculture extension service in Ethiopia: A design-reality gap analysis Cell Phone Use; Market Information; Agriculture Recent research shows that information systems (IS) developed to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and their farming practices have experienced mixed levels of success. As such, an evaluation of contextual factors and the socio-technical requirements of agricultural IS is needed to fully understand the challenges of digitalizing agriculture extension information service (AEIS) in developing countries. We examine the socio-technical design and reality features of an AEIS that was intended to digitalize AEIS in Ethiopia. Conceptually, we use Bass and Heeks's (2011) design-reality framework to unravel the changing socio-technical design requirements and, empirically we draw from a qualitative case study of an existing AEIS. The findings show gaps between the designed artefact and the lived experiences of stakeholders' activities, and the need to shift from a simplistic approach that focuses on providing access to digital content and devices to a balanced approach that addresses socio-technical requirements while digitalizing the public AEIS."
"Zero-sum social policy: going gig and the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme Social Support; Social Care; Direct Payments Australiaâ€™s newly introduced National Disability Insurance Scheme establishes a cash-for-care model that pits the human rights of people with disabilities against the employment rights of care workers, generating a zero-sum game that sees the emergence of gig labour markets, a downward spiral in wages and conditions, and concerns about quality of care. This article introduces the concept of pro-market/gig market to analyze this state-led initiative to restructure a largely publicly funded and nonprofit workforce into a privatized, casualized, and fragmented one."
"Nitrogen fertilizer is a key factor affecting the soil chemical and microbial communities in a mollisol Acidobacterium; Chloroflexi; Microbial Communities Microbial communities drive geochemical cycles in soils. Relatively few studies have assessed the long-term impacts of different types of soil amendments under field conditions in long-term experiments. The response of soil microbial organisms in a Mollisol cultivated with maize for 35 years was examined. Treatments involved the use of N, P, and K fertilizers and two doses of straw residue in isolation or combined. Real-time PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing methods were used to characterize the microbial community. The results showed that addition of nitrogen fertilizers decreased soil pH, but this was mitigated when a high dose of straw was also incorporated. Long-term application of inorganic fertilizers was able to alter the abundance of functional soil microbial population. Application of inorganic N fertilizer resulted in distinctive changes on N-cycle microorganisms. Phosphate-solubilizing functional genes abundance was lower in plots with no phosphate fertilizer. Sequencing analysis showed that the presence or absence of N in the fertilizer mix is a key factor affecting bacterial community diversity of agricultural soil, and pH, total organic C, and total N show a high correlation with bacterial community composition. Nitrogen addition increased the N concentration in the soil, which could cause changes in the soil pH and change the soil bacterial community. Our findings proved that interaction of N fertilizer with other fertilizers can affect microbial communities."
"Non-coding RNAs in legumes: Their emerging roles in regulating biotic/abiotic stress responses and plant growth and development Argonaute Proteins; Gene; Nicotiana Benthamiana Noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interference RNAs (siRNAs), circular RNA (circRNA), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), control gene expression at the transcription, post-transcription, and translation levels. Apart from protein-coding genes, accumulating evidence supports ncRNAs playing a critical role in shaping plant growth and development and biotic and abiotic stress responses in various species, including legume crops. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) interact with DNA, RNA, and proteins, modulating their target genes. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling these cellular processes are not well understood. Here, we discuss the features of various ncRNAs, including their emerging role in contributing to biotic/abiotic stress response and plant growth and development, in addition to the molecular mechanisms involved, focusing on legume crops. Unravelling the underlying molecular mechanisms and functional implications of ncRNAs will enhance our understanding of the coordinated regulation of plant defences against various biotic and abiotic stresses and for key growth and development processes to better design various legume crops for global food security."
"Microfinance financial sustainability and outreach: is there a trade-off? Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion The financial sustainability of microfinance institutions (MFIs) is crucial for the continual existence of the microfinance industry. As a result, emphasis has been placed on the financial sustainability of MFIs over the past few years. However, with the primary goal of the industry being the attainment of social outreach, the emphasis on financial sustainability has raised concerns about a potential adverse effect on outreach. Using data on 1595 MFIs in 109 countries, we examine if there is a trade-off between financial sustainability and outreach. The evidence shows that there is a trade-off between sustainability and outreach depth, but complementarity between sustainability and outreach breadth."
"Challenges and enablers of women entrepreneurs’ career advancement in Vietnam’s coffee industry Migrant Workers; Self-Employment; Ethnic Business Purpose: This paper aims to explore the motivational factors and contextual facilitators of female entrepreneurs in Vietnamâ€™s coffee industry and also the barriers facing them. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts the grounded theory approach, using semi-structured in-depth interviews with 31 women entrepreneurs in the coffee industry in the rural Central Highlands of Vietnam. Findings: This study found that necessity-driven factors play an important role in motivating female entrepreneurs to advance their careers. However, these factors may be transformed into the opportunity-driven motives. Furthermore, the findings suggest that Asiaâ€™s collectivism culture and family support significantly affect the success of the women entrepreneurs, although gender inequality is not perceived as a serious constraint in entrepreneurial activities. Research limitations/implications: This study has implications for the literature of women entrepreneurs regarding motivations and contextual influences in agricultural and rural areas of Vietnam. However, the sample size is relatively small which limits the concept generation of the study. For further research, a larger sample size with different business sectors should be considered to generate more explicit findings. Practical implications: The findings from this study can assist the policymakers in developing strategies and governmental policies to support the career advancement of women entrepreneurs and improving gender equality in Vietnam. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature about understanding the motives and the roles of socioeconomic contexts in womenâ€™s entrepreneurial activities in agricultural and rural areas."
"Microfinance in Latin America and the Caribbean: the curse and blessing of ethnic diversity Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion Latin America is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the world, and is also characterized by high levels of poverty. As a poverty alleviation tool, microfinance emerged in the region and has significantly evolved over the years. However, the implications of the regionâ€™s high diversity on the performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs) are however not known. We attempt to fill this gap by providing evidence on the association between MFI performance and indices of ethnic and linguistic fractionalization. Our findings suggest that fractionalization promotes MFI financial performance but is detrimental to outreach depth. These results are robust to various sensitivity tests."
"Choosing the right nature-based solutions to meet diverse urban challenges Cultural Ecosystem Services; China; Natural Capital Increasing focus on Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in cities has significantly expanded the range of applications in which urban nature is considered useful, as well as the range of NBS available. Traditional parks, gardens and street trees now sit alongside innovative approaches including rooftop pollinator habitats, constructed wetlands and hydroponic green facades, each of which has its own particular challenges and benefits. This variety of solutions introduces an important new decision-making challenge for cities wishing to implement NBS: choosing the right set of specific NBS interventions. Decision support tools such as Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) can help navigate complex decisions, but their application to urban NBS selection decisions has been limited. Current NBS assessment frameworks tend to either give highly aggregated results, or are tailored to only one specific ecosystem service. Here we demonstrate a novel application of MCDA to the practical challenge of selecting a set of NBS to address multiple urban challenges. The MCDA tool developed here was used in seven cities participating in the European Union project â€˜Urban GreenUPâ€™. We describe the development and use of the MCDA tool, and explore how cities used the tool to guide NBS selection. We also evaluate the tool using sensitivity analysis and feedback from users. We find that participating cities are seeking to balance a large number of possible benefits from NBS solutions, and the tool proved useful for navigating the selection decision. Users identified opportunities to improve the tool's usability and clarity. They also noted a key strength of the tool as a prompt for co-production of knowledge and decisions. Collectively, these findings advance the design and application of tools to support complex decisions about selecting NBS to address diverse urban challenges."
"A baseline for POPs contamination in Australian seabirds: little penguins vs. short-tailed shearwaters Feathers; Birds; Grus Japonensis While globally distributed throughout the world's ecosystems, there is little baseline information on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in marine environments in Australia and, more broadly, the Southern Hemisphere. To fill this knowledge gap, we collected baseline information on POPs in migratory short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris) from Fisher Island, Tasmania, and resident little penguins (Eudyptula minor) from Phillip Island, Victoria. Levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) were determined from blood samples, with total contamination ranging 7.6-47.7 ng/g ww for short-tailed shearwaters and 0.12-46.9 ng/g ww for little penguins. In both species contamination followed the same pattern where PCBs>OCPs>BFRs. BFR levels included the presence of the novel flame retardant hexabromobenzene (HBB). These novel results of POPs in seabirds in southeast Australia provide important information on the local (penguins) and global (shearwaters) distribution of POPs in the marine environment."
"Hybrid Color Filters for Multispectral Imaging Color Printing; Metals; Counterfeiting Multispectral cameras capture images in multiple wavelengths in narrow spectral bands. They offer advanced sensing well beyond normal cameras and many single-sensor-based multispectral cameras are commercialized aimed at a broad range of applications, such as agroforestry research, medical analysis, and so on. However, the existing single-sensor-based multispectral cameras require accurate alignment to overlay each filter on image sensor pixels, which makes their fabrication very complex, especially when the number of bands is large. This paper demonstrates a new filter technology using a hybrid combination of single plasmonic layer and dielectric layers by computational simulations. A filter mosaic of various bands with narrow spectral width can be achieved with single run manufacturing processes (i.e., exposure, development, deposition, and other minor steps) regardless of the number of bands."
"Compensation for land use deprivation in mining: an analysis of the laws and practices relating to land use deprivation compensation in Ghana’s mining sector Niger; Oil; Haram This article examines the laws and valuation methods that valuers apply in assessing compensation for land use deprivation in Ghanaâ€™s mining sector using two mining companies as case studies. We argue that analysing the valuation techniques applied in assessing compensation for land use deprivation in the context of current legal provisions facilitates a better understanding of the issues fuelling community dissatisfaction with compensation awards. Data pro-duced through document analysis and interviews with 39 farmers, government officials, chiefs, private valuers, and officials of Newmont Goldcorpâ€™s Ahafo Mine and Asanko Gold Ghana Limited were analysed in the context of the current legal framework for expropriation. Interview transcripts were coded based on themes and analysed using the constant comparison method. The findings reveal that the valuation techniques for assessing compensation for land use deprivation disregard fundamental compensation principles outlined under law. The study also exposes the weaknesses in the valuation techniques in assessing compensation for farmlands that mining may impair permanently. Towards ensuring fairness in compensating mining-impacted farmers, this study recommends additional legal directives to streamline the methods for assessing compensation for land use deprivation. The consequences of the limitations in the valuation methods on expropriated farmers are also discussed."
"Machinability Analysis of Finish-Turning Operations for Ti6Al4V Tubes Fabricated by Selective Laser Melting Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) With the advent of additive manufacturing as an advanced technology for the fabrication of titanium components, there is a pressing need to investigate the machinability of parts produced using these techniques compared to components made with conventional wrought methodologies. The motivation for this study was to investigate the influences of machining parameters, especially cutting depth, on the machinability of selective laser melted (SLMed) Ti6Al4V tubes, by analyzing the cutting responses, including cutting forces, machined surface roughness and tool wear at varying cutting parameters. Generally, it can be inferred that specific cutting tools used to machine wrought titanium components can also be used for SLMed parts when carrying out finish-machining operations. Cutting forces in the machining of SLMed workpieces could be up to 70% higher than those in machining the wrought counterparts. In contrast, the tool-wear analysis correspondingly showed larger tool-workpiece engagement area on the tool rake face for tools used for machining wrought parts. Adhesion on the cutting edge in the form of built-up edge and attrition of the tool surface were found to be the two most dominant tool-wear mechanisms, and the oxidation condition of the tool surface in machining SLMed parts was more severe (about 8% and 21%). Vibration analysis was also carried out, but no significant difference between the SLMed and wrought workpieces was observed, and the quality of the machined surface was similar."
"Manufacturing capital utilisation, firm dynamics and wage inequality Economics; Unskilled Labour; Urban Unemployment This paper examines the short- and long-run effects of manufacturing capital utilisation on income distribution and social welfare of an economy. A rise in manufacturing capital utilisation lowers the effective cost of capital. This increases the demand for capital in the urban sector, which raises firm output and profitability but reduces the availability of capital in the rural sector. Unskilled wage is lowered. Thus, a rise in manufacturing capital utilisation increases income inequality in the short run. In the long run, due to the firm-entry effect, a rise in manufacturing capital utilisation further exacerbates the inequality situation. Empirical analysis confirms the theoretical findings. In particular, a one per cent increase in manufacturing capital utilisation leads to about 0.58% increase in income inequality, of which the contribution from the firm-entry effect is about 28%."
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Sustainable Institutional Food Systems: Implementation of AI Tools for School Nutrition Program Management in the United States of America Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems School food programs can improve the nutritional status at community level, and can be a powerful tool to facilitate a transition to sustainable food systems, particularly through their purchasing methods and meal/waste management. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enable or inhibit transitions to sustainability, due to its capacity to facilitate transformational change and disruption. Thus, AI can have major impacts on achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including those related to food systems. This paper focuses on critically exploring different aspects during the implementation of a software project in US schools that used AI techniques to enable agility and provide healthy food options for schoolchildren. Participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis were used to inform the case study and uncover the new processes developed using the technology. As a key barrier to the effective management of school food programs and nutrition is the administrative load associated with statutory compliance, this case study demonstrates the difference that AI-powered tools can make in alleviating the weight of administrative processes. An Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-enabled boundary spanning framework is used to extend the case study toward an analysis of the systems, boundaries, relationships and perspectives which starts mapping the areas where the private sector, public institutions and civil society can meet to fast-track sustainable transition activities, particularly in the context of food systems. This article presents some possible approaches to facilitating these activities, inviting policy makers to bridge the gap with businesses and use business agility to support common societal goals to achieve sustainable food systems."
"Prosperity for the poor: Religion, poverty and development in Sub-Saharan Africa Pentecostal; Prosperity Gospel; Christianity In this chapter, the authors present a much-needed discussion on the role of religion in the development process in Sub-Saharan Africa. The authors invoke the case of the very popular Pentecostal prosperity gospel doctrine, a â€œreligious policyâ€ on poverty alleviation that promises material wealth and health to all believers through faith and monetary offerings to God (church). The authors examine how this doctrine is shaping local imaginations of poverty, and the moral agency of pursuing wealth in the market economy, as well as the ethics and apologetics of the doctrineâ€™s material costs. The chapter therefore presents a useful invitation to development stakeholders and researchers to take religion more seriously in the conversation on development and poverty alleviation in Africa."
"Are sterols useful for the identification of sources of faecal contamination in shellfish? A case study Cholestanols; Organic Matter; Sterols This work aimed to identify the major source(s) of faecal pollution impacting Salcott Creek oyster fisheries in the UK through the examination of the sterol profiles. The concentration of the major sewage biomarker, coprostanol, in water overlying the oysters varied between 0.01 Î¼g Lâˆ’1 and 1.20 Î¼g Lâˆ’1. The coprostanol/epicoprostanol ratio ranged from 1.32 (September) to 33.25 (February), suggesting that human sewage represents the key input of faecal material into the estuary. However, a correlation between the sterol profile of water above the oysters with that of water that enters from Tiptree Sewage Treatment Works (r = 0.82), and a sample from a site (Quinces Corner) observed to have a high population of Brent geese (r = 0.82), suggests that both sources contribute to the faecal pollution affecting the oysters. In identifying these key faecal inputs, sterol profiling has allowed targeted management practices to be employed to ensure that oyster quality is optimised."
"Women's Refuges and Critical Social Work: Opportunities and Challenges in Advancing Social Justice Emigration And Immigration; Resettlement; Asylum Women's refuges play a crucial role in responding to the needs of women and children experiencing family violence; yet there has been limited research conducted into their operations, practices and challenges faced. This article is informed by critical social work's theoretical tradition of seeking to end social injustice and analyses key opportunities and challenges of providing refuge amidst a neo-liberal context. We draw on interviews and focus groups with service providers and women who had sought access to a refuge, from a study that was undertaken following the Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence in Australia. We found widespread practices by refuges to support social justice for women and children experiencing family violence, as well as challenges and constraints, substantially linked to resource limitations consistent with neo-liberal policies. This research shines a light on innovative refuge practice in local contexts identifying feminist social justice and intersectional practices aligned with critical social work."
"Data quality as an antecedent for commercial viability of circular economy business models: A case study Sustainability; Ecodesign; Cradle-To-Cradle Introduction - The aim of this paper is to explore data quality as an antecedent of commercially viable business models within the circular economy. Australian state governments are developing policies to enable a circular economy. However, in the building industry most data systems rely on self-reporting, which has compromised the accuracy, objectivity, transparency and integrity of data reported on raw materials within components and products. Method - This paper uses a case study to demonstrate how digital data systems that independently track, trace and verify the provenance of inputs of raw materials, components and products, can accurately inform the value of circularity in the built environment. Interviews were conducted with an office furniture supplier who developed a digital system to inform circularity. Also interviewed was a sustainability consultant who assisted, and has since prototyped a digital system designed to accurately enable circular value to be identified in the built environment. Feedback on the design and protype of this proposed system was provided by building industry value-chain stakeholders though a series of seminars and design thinking workshops. Results - Commercial viability of a circular economy model was reliant on a framework of data quality that recorded raw materials, traceability and verification to establish trust: 1) data capturing raw materials within components of products (e.g. metals, melamine and plastics), 2) data tracking of products throughout their life-cycle, and 3) data verifying the authenticity of raw materials and products. This framework of data quality was critical to delivering circularity outcomes for reuse of products, repurposing components, recycling and minimising landfill. Conclusion - This study proposes that data quality is integral to the commercial viability of circular economy business models in the built environment. Data quality in a circular economy means having the digital capability to objectively track, trace and verify the integrity and composition of building materials, products and assemblies throughout their lifecycle."
"Bioinspired cellular cementitious structures for prefabricated construction: Hybrid design & performance evaluations Lattice Structure; Three-Dimensional Printing; Sandwich Beam Lightweight cellular structures with porous architectures and controllable mechanical characteristics are promising candidates for a broad range of prefabricated engineering applications. A triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structure that is a naturally inspired continuous non-self-intersecting surface is a bioinspired cellular structure. In this work, we investigate a novel approach based on a combination of primitive-TPMS cells and cubic blocks along with lattice and gyroid-TPMS cells achieving 50% volume fraction cellular structures. Lightweight cellular specimens made of cement mortar with 3D printed sacrificial thermoplastic Polylactic Acid (PLA) moulds are subjected to uniaxial compressive loadings. Compression tests are carried out on the cement cubes, while tensile behaviours follow the simplified damage plasticity model, which is used to obtain the material properties for the input model data. Finite element (FE) analysis is employed to predict mechanical performances such as stress distributions, stress-strain curves, and the damage mechanisms of three representative cellular structures (primitive, lattice, and gyroid). Compressive experiment tests are conducted on these blocks and validated by the FE model. Results indicate that the mechanical responses of the cellular structure, wherein primitive cellular structures yield the highest compressive strength, could be predicted accurately through the FE analysis, and outcomes from both numerical models and experimental tests are validated."
"Impacts of farmers' adaptation to drought and salinity intrusion on rice yield in Vietnam's Mekong Delta Crops; CERES (Experiment); Climate Change Impact Purpose: The Vietnamese Mekong River Delta (VMD) is one of the most affected deltas by climate change in the world. Several studies have investigated factors influencing farmers' climate change adaptation behaviors in the region; however, little is known about the effectiveness of such measures. This paper examines the determinants of adaptation strategies among VMD rice farmers and assesses the impacts of such practices on rice yield. Design/methodology/approach: Endogenous switching regressions were employed using a survey data of 300 rice-producing households in An Giang and Tra Vinh provinces in 2016. Findings: The results show that farmers receiving early disaster warnings are more likely to adopt adaptation measures to climate change. If nonadaptors had chosen to respond, their rice yield would have increased by 0.932 tons/ha/season. Research limitations/implications: The data sample is small and collected from two provinces in the VMD only; therefore, the results may be specific for the study sites. However, future research can adopt the proposed method for other regions. Originality/value: The study estimates the production impacts of farmers' decisions on whether or not to adapt to extreme climate events. The proposed approach allows for capturing both observed and unobserved behaviors."
"The health impact of residential retreats: A systematic review Mindfulness Meditation; Mindfulness; Inner Experience Background: Unhealthy lifestyles are a major factor in the development and exacerbation of many chronic diseases. Improving lifestyles though immersive residential experiences that promote healthy behaviours is a focus of the health retreat industry. This systematic review aims to identify and explore published studies on the health, wellbeing and economic impact of retreat experiences. Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsychINFO databases were searched for residential retreat studies in English published prior to February 2017. Studies were included if they were written in English, involved an intervention program in a residential setting of one or more nights, and included before-and-after data related to the health of participants. Studies that did not meet the above criteria or contained only descriptive data from interviews or case studies were excluded. Results: A total of 23 studies including eight randomised controlled trials, six non-randomised controlled trials and nine longitudinal cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies included a total of 2592 participants from diverse geographical and demographic populations and a great heterogeneity of outcome measures, with seven studies examining objective outcomes such as blood pressure or biological makers of disease, and 16 studies examining subjective outcomes that mostly involved self-reported questionnaires on psychological and spiritual measures. All studies reported post-retreat health benefits ranging from immediately after to five-years post-retreat. Study populations varied widely and most studies had small sample sizes, poorly described methodology and little follow-up data, and no studies reported on health economic outcomes or adverse effects, making it difficult to make definite conclusions about specific conditions, safety or return on investment. Conclusions: Health retreat experiences appear to have health benefits that include benefits for people with chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, various cancers, HIV/AIDS, heart conditions and mental health. Future research with larger numbers of subjects and longer follow-up periods are needed to investigate the health impact of different retreat experiences and the clinical populations most likely to benefit. Further studies are also needed to determine the economic benefits of retreat experiences for individuals, as well as for businesses, health insurers and policy makers."
"Populist contestations: Cultural change and the competing languages of sexual and gender identity Football; Masculinity; Sports There has been a vast proliferation of categories, descriptors and labels used to describe gender and sexual identity over the past few years, with terms now numbering in the hundreds. Many terms, such as heteroflexible, asexual, demigirl and sapiosexual actively contest masculine/feminine and hetero/homo binary arrangements of identity, and LGBTQ minority rights discourses and arguably represent an epochal shift in gender/sexual knowledge frameworks. The cultural conditions that make such change possible have yet to be explored. This paper draws on theoretical approaches to populism to analyse the role of popular culture, digital communication and contestation of institutional and expert knowledges in driving the emergence of new gender and sexual terminology."
"Using photovoice to examine physical activity in the urban context and generate policy recommendations: The heart healthy hoods study Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians A current challenge in physical activity research is engaging citizens with co-creating policies that support physical activity participation. Using Photovoice, a participatory action research method, the objectives of this study were to: 1) Identify community perceptions of urban built, social, and political/economic environment factors associated with physical activity; and 2) generate community-driven policy recommendations to increase physical activity. Two districts in Madrid of varying socio-economic status (SES) were selected. Overall, 24 residents participated in 4 groups stratified by sex and district (6 participants per group). Groups met weekly for 4 weeks to discuss and analyze their photographs. Participants coded photographs into categories, which were then regrouped into broader themes. The categories were transformed into policy recommendations using an adaptation of the logical framework approach. Participants took 161 photos, which were classified into 61 categories and 14 broader themes (e.g., active transportation, sport in the city). After this, participants generated a set of 34 policy recommendations to improve the urban environment to support physical activity (e.g., to redistribute sports facilities). Collaboration between citizens and researchers led to a deeper understanding of the community perceptions of urban built, social, and political/economic environment factors associated with physical activity in two districts of Madrid, while engaging citizens in recommending public policies."
"Ethnic diversity and human capital development in India: A disaggregated analysis at the state and district levels China; Institutional Quality; Multicultural Diversity This study contributes to the development literature by providing a new perspective on understanding factors that influence human capital development in India. We examine the effects of ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity on various measures of human capital at the state and district levels. Based on indices of ethnic diversity calculated for 30 Indian States and 557 districts, we examine the direct effects of ethnic diversity on indicators such as infant mortality, education and health. Our findings suggest that, on average, ethnic diversity contributes to some elements of development. Specifically, we find evidence to support development-enhancing effects of diversity on education and health."
"Sustainability leaders in construction industry: A preliminary study Sustainability; Environmental Management Systems; Eco-Management and Audit Scheme With the increasing need of sustainable development globally, many world-leading construction companies have devoted great efforts to implementing sustainable practices. RobecoSAM publishes Sustainability Yearbook annually since 2004, which lists the sustainability leaders in various industries, including construction industry. Learning from those sustainability leaders in construction industry can provide useful references for construction related companies when developing their sustainable development strategies. Based on comprehensive literature review, this paper thus identified 51 methods used for improving sustainability performance and 34 outcomes achieved through these methods. The methods and outcomes are used for coding the sustainable practices of sustainability leaders in construction sector. With the coding system, sustainability reports issued by sustainability leaders in construction sector were analyzed with content analysis. Then, social network analysis was employed to identify the key adopted methods and achieved outcomes (KAMAO) from these leaders. The findings provide valuable guidance for international contractors to have a better understanding of the top sustainable methods adopted by sustainability leaders in construction sector and the top outcomes achieved by these leaders."
"Continuing the precedent: Financially disadvantaging young people in ""unprecedented"" COVID-19 times Job Insecurity; Personnel; Perceived Employability The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health and an economic crisis. Economically, lockdowns across Australia have devastated business and industry, creating immediate spikes in under- and unemployment. These impacts intersect with the precarious labour market of casualised and ""gig"" economy work, where young workers constitute an established and substantial group. While negatively impacting upon many young peopleâ€™s lives, in recent decades precarious employment has also been normalised for young people as they are encouraged to understand themselves as self-reliant and entrepreneurial in their working lives. Yet, these workers have been largely abandoned in the governmentâ€™s economic response to COVID-19. The economic impact and government response to the pandemic substantially disadvantage young people. This article analyses the impact of new government initiatives: the ""JobKeeper"" wage subsidy scheme, ""JobSeeker"" payments and early access to superannuation, ""JobMaker"" economic recovery plan and the redesign of university fees. These initiatives compound preexisting youth policy of low welfare levels, youth wages and high university fees to economically burden young people. Contrasting the repeated expression of anything pandemic related as ""unprecedented"", we argue that the economic abandonment of young people in the immediate COVID-19 crisis continues a decades-long precedent in Australia of economically disadvantaging young people."
"Arbitrary-Order Continuous Finite-Time Sliding Mode Controller for Fixed-Time Convergence Sliding Mode Control; Twisting; Controller Obtaining fixed-time convergence has recently gained much attention. In this case, the convergence time does not depend on initial conditions, unlike conventional control schemes. This brief proposes a new algorithm for finite-time sliding mode control, which can provide fixed-time convergence by suitably adding some special non-linear terms in the control design. The proposed control is free from chattering, which is often required in many practical applications. Moreover, it can be generalized to any arbitrary order dynamical system. The convergence of the proposed scheme is proved. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by comparing with existing methods."
"Tuning the work function of the silicene/4 × 4 Ag(111) surface Silicene; Electronic Properties; Topological Insulators Silicene, the silicon analog of graphene, is an atomically thin two-dimensional material with promising applications in gas sensing, storage and as components in modern electronic devices. Silicene epitaxially grown on the Ag(111) surface can expand the utility of the silver surface by enabling the tuning of its work function through the functionalisation of silicene. Here we examine the electronic and structural properties and the thermodynamic stability of functionalised silicene/4 Ã— 4 Ag(111) using density functional theory calculations coupled with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We focus on 11 functional groups, namely phenyl, methyl, hydroxyl, cyano, methoxyl, amino and ethylmethylamine, in addition to 4 halogen atoms. These functional groups are shown to endow the Si/Ag(111) surface with a large variation in the work function. Our AIMD simulations confirm the thermodynamic stability of these 11 functionalised structures. This work shows the possibility of tuning the electronic structure of silicene by functionalisation, which could then be utilized in polymer solar cells and nanoelectronic circuit components."
"A triple bottom line approach to optimising odour removal from a residential water supply Waste Water; Life Cycle Assessment; Biosolids Feedwater to Euroa Water Treatment Plant contains increasingly high levels of natural organic matter (NOM) which were determined to cause its strong earthy odour. A multidisciplinary approach was used to evaluate the coagulation process to better remove the taste and odour (T&O) causing organics from water supplied to the local towns. Such high levels of NOM require elevated doses of coagulant for removal, accounting for approximately 60% of the chemical costs. A need arose to reduce these operational costs. However, community expectations regarding T&O, and social and environmental impacts, are not typically considered in this process. The local water corporation, Goulburn Valley Water, undertook a case study involving a comparison of three coagulants to optimise the chemical coagulation process from a multidisciplinary (triple bottom line, TBL) perspective. The financial assessment incorporated operational costs and potential infrastructure requirements. The social assessment investigated the overall impacts on staff operating the water treatment plant and their broader community involvement. The environmental assessment focused on the impact on downstream infrastructure from changes in sludge volumes and wastewater quality, and third-party greenhouse gas emissions from chemical deliveries. From a TBL viewpoint, aluminium chlorohydrate was the most beneficial option."
"Making home or making do: a critical look at homemaking without a home Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease This paper critically examines the concept of alternative forms of â€˜homemakingâ€™ among people without a settled home. The introductory section establishes the framework for the paper, providing an overview of homelessness and the homemaking literature. Strengths in the homemaking approach are identified, which reconceptualises homelessness as a human-centered phenomenon that can be understood as â€˜resistanceâ€™ to societies that block accesses to mainstream housing for people who are (also) socially and economically marginalised. Homemaking moves beyond mainstream academic analyses which explore homelessness in terms of â€˜sinâ€™ (addiction and criminality), â€˜sicknessâ€™ (poor health, especially poor mental health) and â€˜systemsâ€™ (housing market failure and inadequate social protection and public health systems). The paper argues that, while important in refreshing our thinking about homelessness by offering a new, radical epistemology of housing, homemaking is limited by not contextualising the dwelling practices it seeks to explain, particularly in respect of how it defines â€˜homelessnessâ€™ and also risks misinterpreting transitory behavioural adaptations as something deeper."
"Defining the capable engineer: Non-technical skills that support safe decisions in uncertain, dynamic situations Safety Climate; Accident; Health Management Education and learning are key topics in the safety research literature but the literature focuses primarily on organisational learning from accidents and non-technical skills for those in frontline roles where avoidance of active errors is key. This article addresses the non-technical skills that engineers need in order to make the best long-term choices for public safety while navigating organisational complexity. Previous contributions on engineering education reflect a strong focus on technical competence. Situated in the emerging conversations among education scholars on professional capabilities, we identify the holistic attributes and skills that empower engineers to make the best decisions for safety in uncertain, dynamic situations. Drawing on interviews with 41 engineers in the gas pipeline sector, the analysis develops a framework of individual capabilities for public safety decision-making consisting of 20 core elements. We see these 20 capabilities as falling into six categories: (a) use long-term, foresighted reasoning, especially in the face of uncertainty, (b) understand norms and values that inform actions, (c) think systematically and understand interconnectedness, (d) collaborate with and draw on the experience of others, (e) ground decisions in reality and (f) advocate for action and take responsibility. This capability framework has resonance with comparable work done in the field of sustainability education and extends the safety literature on non-technical skills into a domain where latent errors, rather than active errors, predominate."
"Income inequality and subjective wellbeing: Panel data evidence from China Subjective Well-Being; Happiness; Life Satisfaction Using four waves of longitudinal data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), we examine the effects of income inequality on subjective wellbeing (SWB). We take a dual approach in measuring income inequality, and thus, we examine the effects of inequality using province-level Gini coefficient as well as between-group inequality or identity-related inequality defined as the income gap between migrants without urban household registration identity (hukou) and urban residents. We find negative effects of both province-level income inequality and between-group income inequality on SWB, measured by life satisfaction. Our results also show that the effects of income inequality on SWB is stronger for rural hukou residents compared to urban hukou residents. These findings are robust to alternative ways of measuring SWB and income inequality. In addition, we find evidence suggesting that neighbourhood trust is an important channel through which income inequality operates to reduce SWB. We suggest policies that promote trust in communities with high inequality with a view of addressing the negative effects of inequality on SWB."
"Housing for degrowth: Principles, models, challenges and opportunities Degrowth; Environmental Conflict; Aciclovir â€˜Degrowthâ€™, a type of â€˜postgrowthâ€™, is becoming a strong political, practical and cultural movement for downscaling and transforming societies beyond capitalist growth and non-capitalist productivism to achieve global sustainability and satisfy everyoneâ€™s basic needs. This groundbreaking collection on housing for degrowth addresses key challenges of unaffordable, unsustainable and anti-social housing today, including going beyond struggles for a â€˜right to the cityâ€™ to a â€˜right to metabolismâ€™, advocating refurbishment versus demolition, and revealing controversies within the degrowth movement on urbanisation, decentralisation and open localism. International case studies show how housing for degrowth is based on sufficiency and conviviality, living a â€˜one planet lifestyleâ€™ with a common ecological footprint. This book explores environmental, cultural and economic housing and planning issues from interdisciplinary perspectives such as urbanism, ecological economics, environmental justice, housing studies and policy, planning studies and policy, sustainability studies, political ecology, social change and degrowth. It will appeal to students and scholars across a wide range of disciplines."
"Bridging the Gap Between Industry and Academia: The Case of Indonesia Entrepreneurial University; Academic Entrepreneurship; Innovation As a country, Indonesia is becoming increasingly urbanized and has a large proportion of its population under the age of 25 years, at slightly over 100 million. Developing this fairly large proportion of its population from a human capital perspective is essential for the future of the country. Currently there is a 40% gap between supply and demand; and is expected to grow to 70% by 2025. Building an educational platform for effective learning and skills formation is urgently needed. This entry presents the outcomes of a case study aimed at understanding the disconnects between academia, industry and government in the context of Indonesiaâ€™s built environment programs. In particular, the architecture profession and architectural education have been considered as one of several built environment programs under pressure to change. Built environment suite of programs have various disciplinary underpinnings: architecture, building, engineering, planning, quantity surveying, project management and others such as interior design and transportation engineering. The case study focuses on the results of a workshop in Indonesia, where various stakeholders responsible for city planning and building came together to determine the current challenges and seek solutions. The entry delves into the education of the architecture profession in Indonesia and presents the results of the workshop with some recommendations for the future. The results show that the various sectors and stakeholders are prepared to work collaboratively and support joint ownership of meeting curricular outcomes."
"Manufacturability of Ti-Al-4V Hollow-Walled Lattice Struts by Laser Powder Bed Fusion Lattice Structure; Three-Dimensional Printing; Sandwich Beam Hollow-walled lattices are novel cellular materials with lower densities than conventional dense-walled lattices. However, their manufacturability by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is not yet established. This study investigates the LPBF manufacturability of Ti-6Al-4V hollow-walled struts with respect to strut outer diameter, wall thickness (controlled by laser scan path), and inclination angle, while the strut length is purposely limited to 10â€“15 mm, typical of lattice unit dimensions. The manufacturability was reliable for outer diameters exceeding 0.5 mm and wall thicknesses exceeding 0.24 mm over the inclines of 22.5Â°â€“90Â°. To ensure a manufacturable hollow cylindrical channel by LPBF, we recommend a minimum inner diameter of 4Dv(90) according to the feedstock powder size distribution. The average inconsistency of 5.13% between the designed and manufactured outer diameters was substantially lower than that achievable by conventional manufacturing. The findings of this study provide necessary guidance for the future manufacture of hollow-walled lattices by LPBF."
"An integrated approach to reducing the risk of work- related musculoskeletal disorders Musculoskeletal Diseases; Posture; Ergonomics This chapter describes the complex aetiology of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). It is evident that multiple construction project stakeholders can play a part in reducing WMSD risks. The chapter provides a general overview of WMSDs in construction, describing the size and apparently intractable nature of the problem. Risk factors for WMSDs fall into two categories: those related to the physical workload; and those related to the psychosocial work environment. The chapter summarizes some specific risk factors associated with particular tasks. Opportunities are identified for reducing the risk of WMSDs by considering particular issues at the design stage. The chapter discusses how to measure WMSD risk and, more importantly, to objectively evaluate risk reduction strategies. Finally, it explores the potential for engaging construction workers in redesigning work processes by using a participatory ergonomics approach."
"Many IUCN red list species have names that evoke negative emotions Sentiment Classification; Data Mining; Product Review Species common names underpin communication between researchers, stakeholders and the public. Changing unappealing (e.g., rough-skinned horned toad), misleading (e.g., lesser bird of paradise) or even immemorable (e.g., little grassbird) species names could be an effective, and inexpensive, way to improve engagement with and support for threatened species. We use two sentiment lexicons to analyze the common names of 26,794 IUCN Red List animal species to understand which words drive sentiment in species names. Words driving common name sentiment varied across taxonomic class and threat status; highly frequent words associated with human emotions included anger, fear, disgust, and joy. We identified keywords for future targeted research on strategic name changes (e.g., greater, golden, least, lesser, false). This article provides essential grounding for future species common name research and improving public engagement with threatened species."
"Legitimacy theory: Despite its enduring popularity and contribution, time is right for a necessary makeover Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to reflect upon the contributions made to the social and environmental accounting literature by papers that comprised a 2002 Special Issue of Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal (AAAJ) entitled social and environmental reporting and its role in maintaining or creating organisational legitimacy. This paper will also provide insights into the origins of legitimacy theory as used in the social and environmental accounting literature as well as providing reflections about the strengths, and shortcomings, of the theory. Suggestions are made with respect to the ongoing application, and development, of legitimacy theory. Design/methodology/approach: As a commentary, this paper utilises a review of the social and environmental accounting and institutional literature across a number of decades to reveal insights about the development and use of legitimacy theory as a basis to explain social and environmental reporting practices. Citation data are also used to indicate the potential impact that the papers in the 2002 Special Issue had upon subsequent research. Findings: This commentary shows that the 2002 Special Issue is the most highly cited issue in the history of AAAJ. It also shows that individually, some of the papers in the Special Issue represent some of the most highly cited papers in the social and environmental accounting literature. The commentary provides arguments to suggest that the development of legitimacy theory is in need of further refinement, and suggests a way in which this refinement might take place. Research limitations/implications: This paper is largely based on the opinions of one researcher, and the evidence presented in the paper is selected on the basis that it is deemed sufficient to support the opinions being projected. The paper also relies on citation data as an indicator of â€œimpactâ€. The implication of the research is that it identifies a â€œway forwardâ€ for the development of theory applicable to the understanding of organisational social and environmental reporting practices. Originality/value: The study provides evidence to show that the 2002 Special Issue was significant within the context of AAAJ, and also within the context of the evolution of the social and environmental accounting literature. The description of the history of the development of legitimacy theory, and of the theoryâ€™s subsequent application, provides a solid impetus for future refinements to the theory."
"Improving bioenergy production in anaerobic digestion systems utilising chicken manure via pyrolysed biochar additives: A review Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production There is growing interest in the use of anaerobic digestion (AD) to treat organic waste resulting in volume reduction and stabilisation of the waste together with the production of renewable energy in the form of methane. Currently, livestock manure represents the largest organic waste stream in most countries, causing various negative environmental impacts. However, livestock manure can be used as a readily available feedstock for AD, reducing its environmental impact while simultaneously generating bioenergy. However, the AD of certain livestock manures such as chicken manure is not without constraints due to the high protein nature of the waste. These constraints are typically high digester pH, unfavourably low C:N ratio as well as the build-up of ammonia (NH3). Ammonia production will inevitably lead to NH3 inhibition, which can irreversibly terminate AD and methane production. To mitigate the NH3 stress that accompanies the use of chicken manure as a feedstock, various methods have been previously employed such as in situ NH3 stripping, bentonite addition, Se supplementation, Fe2+ and Ni2+ supplementation, co-digestion, water extraction and biochar addition. Pyrolysed biochar addition represents a new, innovative, and promising method due to its current role in the circular economy. This review provides an in-depth analysis into the current uses and knowledge of biochar for the purpose of NH3 stress mitigation. In addition, the review describes and compares factors that can potentially improve the efficacy of biochar in averting NH3-build up and suggests possible future studies."

"Understanding teachers' cross-disciplinary collaboration for STEAM education: Building a digital community of practice Creative Performance; Implicit Theories; Critical Thinking While creativity was previously considered a specialised ability, over the last 20 years creativity has been reframed as an open set of creative thinking skills and knowledge practices that all teachers can develop through a cross-disciplinary pedagogical approach. STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) has emerged as a cross-disciplinary learning model which explicitly aims to develop creative thinking skills across and through the disciplines. However, teachersâ€™ lack of tacit knowledge in cross-disciplinary collaboration has created challenges and made it hard to implement STEAM in schools. Inspired by the approach of knowledge management, also known as Community of Practice (CoP), and how industries facilitate tacit knowledge propagation across departments to promote creativity through digital support, this article investigates how a Digital-CoP system may potentially support teachersâ€™ cross-disciplinary collaboration. This paper prototypes a Digital CoP System for real world teachers to evaluate. It uses a mixed methods approach to understand teachersâ€™ cross-disciplinary collaboration perception through a Digital-CoP System from the knowledge propagation perspective and points out the further enhancement of the Digital-CoP System enabling it to promote teachers' cross-disciplinary collaboration across Arts and STEM."
"Measures of insulin sensitivity, leptin, and adiponectin concentrations in cats in diabetic remission compared to healthy control cats Fructosamine; Isophane Insulin; Diabetes Mellitus Objectives: Firstly, to compare differences in insulin, adiponectin, leptin, and measures of insulin sensitivity between diabetic cats in remission and healthy control cats, and determine whether these are predictors of diabetic relapse. Secondly, to determine if these hormones are associated with serum metabolites known to differ between groups. Thirdly, if any of the hormonal or identified metabolites are associated with measures of insulin sensitivity. Animals: Twenty cats in diabetic remission for a median of 101 days, and 21 healthy matched control cats. Methods: A casual blood glucose measured on admission to the clinic. Following a 24 h fast, a fasted blood glucose was measured, and blood sample taken for hormone (i.e., insulin, leptin, and adiponectin) and untargeted metabolomic (GC-MS and LC-MS) analysis. A simplified IVGGT (1 g glucose/kg) was performed 3 h later. Cats were monitored for diabetes relapse for at least 9 months (270 days). Results: Cats in diabetic remission had significantly higher serum glucose and insulin concentrations, and decreased insulin sensitivity as indicated by an increase in HOMA and decrease in QUICKI and Bennett indices. Leptin was significantly increased, but there was no difference in adiponectin (or body condition score). Several significant correlations were found between insulin sensitivity indices, leptin, and serum metabolites identified as significantly different between remission and control cats. No metabolites were significantly correlated with adiponectin. No predictors of relapse were identified in this study. Conclusion and clinical importance: Insulin resistance, an underlying factor in diabetic cats, persists in diabetic remission. Cats in remission should be managed to avoid further exacerbating insulin resistance."
"Nutrient removal by alginate-immobilized Chlorella vulgaris: response to different wastewater matrices Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water BACKGROUND: Immobilized algae are a promising tool to treat wastewater within a short time (<12 h) and simplify biomass harvesting compared with suspended algae. The potential of alginate-entrapped Chlorella vulgaris to bioremediate secondary (with and without nutrient supplementation), primary and two lagoon municipal wastewaters was investigated. The capability of the system to adapt to these wastewaters was analysed by determining biotic and abiotic nutrient removal, and further evaluated by comparison with suspended cells. RESULTS: The algal nitrogen (N) content (4.6â€“7.8 wt%) was closely related to the wastewater ammonium concentration (R2 = 0.97). The algal cells did not adapt N uptake as effectively to wastewater nitrate concentration because both abiotic N and phosphorus (P) removal increased. The algal P content (1.2â€“3.2 wt%) varied in response to the wastewater P and was inversely related to the initial cellular P content. The algae thus adapted nutrient uptake to the wastewater N:P level and ratio when ammonium predominated. Biomass production (35â€“73 mg L-1 d-1) increased with dissolved organic and inorganic carbon with little impact from other wastewater characteristics. Immobilization did not affect N and P uptake per cell compared with suspended algae. CONCLUSION: Decoupling biotic and abiotic removal showed adaptation to the N:P of the wastewater and luxury P uptake had significant impact during treatment of different wastewater matrices, these traits were not affected by immobilization. Immobilization enables increased N and P removal rates compared with suspended algal systems as nutrient uptake per cell is not affected and higher concentrations of algal biomass within the reactor are facilitated.

"Limited Impact of Human Cytomegalovirus Infection in African Infants on Vaccine-Specific Responses Following Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis and Measles Vaccination Muromegalovirus; T Lymphocytes; Immunosenescence Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection has a profound effect on the human immune system, causing massive clonal expansion of CD8, and to a lesser extend CD4 T cells. The few human trials that have explored the effect of HCMV infection on responses to vaccination are conflicting, with some studies suggesting no effect whilst others suggest decreased or increased immune responses. Recent studies indicate substantial differences in overall immune system reactivity to vaccines based on age and sex, particularly cellular immunity. 225 nine-month old Gambian infants were immunized with diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis and/or measles vaccines. HCMV infection status was determined by the presence of CMV DNA by PCR of urine samples prior to vaccination. The effect of HCMV infection on either protective antibody immunity or vaccine-specific and overall cellular immune responses 4 weeks post-vaccination was determined, further stratified by sex. Tetanus toxoid-specific antibody responses were significantly lower in HCMV+ infants compared to their HCMV- counterparts, while pertussis, diphtheria and measles antibody responses were generally comparable between the groups. Responses to general T cell stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 as well as antigen-specific cytokine responses to purified protein derivative (PPD) were broadly suppressed in infants infected with HCMV but, perhaps surprisingly, there was only a minimal impact on antigen-specific cellular responses to vaccine antigens. There was evidence for subtle sex differences in the effects of HCMV infection, in keeping with the emerging evidence suggesting sex differences in homeostatic immunity and in responses to vaccines. This study reassuringly suggests that the high rates of HCMV infection in low income settings have little clinically significant impact on antibody and cellular responses to early life vaccines, while confirming the importance of sex stratification in such studies."
"Leaf my neighbourhood alone! predicting the influence of densification on residential tree canopy cover in Perth Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Trees provide myriad ecosystem services of benefit to urban populations; however, urban development is pressuring existing urban tree coverage. Thus, a pertinent challenge for planners is identifying development scenarios that find synergies between urban growth and the preservation or enhancement of tree canopy coverage. This paper presents the training and validation of a model that predicts changes in neighbourhood-level urban tree canopy cover associated with different socio-economic and physical urban form variables. Neighbourhoods across Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, were used as a case study. A Random Forests model was trained using a suite of socio-economic and urban form variables and neighbourhood percentage tree canopy cover derived from very high resolution multispectral remote sensing images and digital surface models. This model was validated using independent test data with a mean absolute error of 1.78% and a root mean square error of 2.42%. An application of this model was demonstrated using the City of Nedlands, Perth, where a new planning scheme allowing denser urban development has been approved by the State Government. The magnitude and spatial variation in the change of neighbourhood tree canopy cover in the City of Nedlands in 2050 associated with three urban development scenarios was predicted using the model."
"Site-Selective Coordination Assembly of Dynamic Metal-Phenolic Networks Mussel Adhesive Protein; Catechols; Adhesion Coordination states of metal-organic materials are known to dictate their physicochemical properties and applications in various fields. However, understanding and controlling coordination sites in metal-organic systems is challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis of site-selective coordinated metal-phenolic networks (MPNs) using flavonoids as coordination modulators. The site-selective coordination was systematically investigated experimentally and computationally using ligands with one, two, and multiple different coordination sites. Tuning the multimodal Fe coordination with catechol, carbonyl, and hydroxyl groups within the MPNs enabled the facile engineering of diverse physicochemical properties including size, selective permeability (20â€“2000 kDa), and pH-dependent degradability. This study expands our understanding of metal-phenolic chemistry and provides new routes for the rational design of structurally tailorable coordination-based materials."
Coherent mid-infrared supercontinuum sources in silicon-germanium waveguides Supercontinuum Generation; Wavelength Conversion; Silicon We report coherent mid-infrared supercontinuum generation in silicon-germanium waveguides. We show that the degree of coherence can be controlled by either employing an air clad configuration or a hybrid chalcogenide/silicon-germanium system.
"Applications of Carbon Dots in Next-generation Lithium-Ion Batteries Fluorescence; Nanodots; Carbon Nanoparticles Lithium-ion battery (LIB) is a dominating power source in the market owing to its high energy density, good cycling stability and environmental benignity. However, technical challenges remain after yearsâ€™ optimization and commercialization, which are detrimental to the expected performance and lifespan of LIBs. For instance, many cathode materials of LIBs suffer from rapid capacity fading and poor high-rate performance, which are ascribed to self-aggregation, dissolution and fast increased charge transfer resistances during cycles. In terms of the anode materials, low coulombic efficiency, electrolyte depletion and safety issues are common. In addition, the liquid electrolyte systems trigger safety concerns because flammable and volatile organic solvents are necessary. Recently, carbon dots (CDs) emerge as a sound material to address those challenges of LIBs, and also present promising applications in bioimaging, fluorescence sensing, photo/electro-catalysis, and electroluminescence. This review will overlook the state-of-the-art advances in the employment of CDs based composites to build cathode/anode materials and electrolytes in LIBs, through tailoring the internal structures and the surface states of electrode materials, and being additives in electrolyte, to improve the performances of the next-generation LIBs. The major challenges and opportunities in front of CDs in LIBs will be outlined and discussed in detail."
"Identification of HIV transmitting CD11c+ human epidermal dendritic cells Sialoadhesin; HIV-1; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Langerhans cells (LC) are thought to be the only mononuclear phagocyte population in the epidermis where they detect pathogens. Here, we show that CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) are also present. These cells are transcriptionally similar to dermal cDC2 but are more efficient antigen-presenting cells. Compared to LCs, epidermal CD11c+ DCs are enriched in anogenital tissues where they preferentially interact with HIV, express the higher levels of HIV entry receptor CCR5, support the higher levels of HIV uptake and replication and are more efficient at transmitting the virus to CD4 T cells. Importantly, these findings are observed using both a lab-adapted and transmitted/founder strain of HIV. We also describe a CD33low cell population, which is transcriptionally similar to LCs but does not appear to function as antigen-presenting cells or acts as HIV target cells. Our findings reveal that epidermal DCs in anogenital tissues potentially play a key role in sexual transmission of HIV."
"Long term creep and shrinkage of nano silica modified high volume fly ash concrete Coal Ash; Silica Fume; Concretes The long-term creep and shrinkage behaviour of two High-Volume Fly Ash (HVFA) concretes incorporating nano silica with 65% and 80% replacement of cement has been investigated. This comprised a detailed analysis of the microstructure, pore structure and chemistry of the two HVFA systems up to a period of 450 days. The compressive strength and modulus of elasticity of HVFA-65 concrete increased from 32 to 73 MPa and 30.3 to 40.5 GPa, respectively between 7 and 450 days. The HVFA-80 concrete achieved compressive strength values of 22 and 71 MPa and elastic modulus values of 28.9 and 37 GPa. After a total loading period of 450 days, HVFA-65 and HVFA-80 concretes displayed creep parameters, which were significantly below the values predicted by AS 3600, ACI 209 and CEB-FIP standard model equations. After a total drying period of 450 days 28-day cured specimens showed significantly reduced shrinkage compared to 7-day cured specimens. On the other hand, HVFA-80 concrete displayed higher shrinkage compared to the HVFA-65 specimens throughout the period. All specimens except for 7-day cured HVFA-80 concrete were within the maximum permissible shrinkage of 800 microns recommended for Australian construction practices. HVFA-65 concrete showed a denser microstructure and a stronger, better packed interfacial transition zone (ITZ) compared to HVFA-80 at all ages. The XRD and FTIR analysis data identified the formation of hydration products including C-S-H and C-A-S-H which contributed towards both the strength gain as well as the creep and shrinkage properties displayed by the HVFA concrete by minimizing the total porosity and pore size."
"User-Centered-Design Approach to Evaluate the User Acceptance of Seating Postures for Autonomous Driving Secondary Activities in a Passenger Vehicle Vibration; Tractors (Agricultural); Office Chair With the development of autonomous driving technology, the passenger vehicles of the future, would allow drivers to participate in non-driving secondary activities or use-cases. In order to facilitate the non-driving use-cases, the interior and the seating arrangements of autonomous passenger vehicles needs to be designed accordingly, The aim of the study is to derive common seating positions and angles for the different autonomous driving secondary activities from their original environments and then experimentally evaluate the user acceptance of these postures for each secondary activity in a passenger vehicle. A user experience questionnaire (UEQ) approach is used to evaluate the user acceptance of the seating postures for the mentioned autonomous driving secondary activity or use-cases. The secondary activities considered in the study include; use of laptop, use of smartphone, general reading, window gazing and sleeping. The angles used for the seating postures include; seat-pan angle, back rest angle and neck-flexion angle."
"Wage theft, underpayment and unpaid work in marketised social care Personnel; Enterprise Bargaining; Employer Association Marketised models of social care provision in Australia are placing pressures on service providers and driving changes in work organisation and employer practices, with potential to degrade social care jobs. While international experience of marketised social care has demonstrated the vulnerability of social care workers to wage theft and other violations of employment laws, Australiaâ€™s relatively strong industrial relations safety net might be expected to be better able to protect these low-paid workers. Nevertheless, there is emerging evidence of negative impacts on the pay and entitlements of frontline workers in the expanding community support and homecare workforce. This study investigates the paid and unpaid work time of disability support workers under Australiaâ€™s new National Disability Insurance Scheme. The research takes a novel approach combining analysis of working day diaries and qualitative interviews with employees to expose how jobs are being fragmented and work is being organised into periods of paid and unpaid time, leaving employees paid below their minimum entitlement. The article highlights the role of social care policy along with inadequate employment regulation. JEL Codes: J390, J81, J88."
"Comparing Australian garment and childcare homeworkers’ experience of regulation and representation ILO; Personnel; Right to Strike Labour markets in Australia have long been segmented by gender and race. This study compares two highly gendered and racially segmented labour markets, home-based family day care workers and garment homeworkers. The comparative cases examine the broader trends of migration, production and consumption that reinforce gender and racial stereotypes, and discourses that underpin representations that women workers are ideally suited to such work. We theorise the gender and racialised inequalities of homework based on the literature on invisibilisation and social reproduction to explore the vulnerable position of migrant women and the consequences of having limited options, such as legal and social protections and any capacity to collectively organise. Our analysis examines the roles and responses of institutions and conceptualises the socio-political factors that affect the characterisation of homework as non-work or as self-employed entrepreneurial activities. By mapping the differing regulatory trajectories of these two groups of homeworkers in terms of regulation and representation, we find both similarities and differences. While garment homeworkers have achieved recognition through legislation and social mobilisation, their circumstances leave them less likely to access such rights. By contrast, the failure to recognise family day care homeworkers, has left them to market forces. JEL code: J01."
"Factors influencing the concentration of fecal coliforms in oysters in the river Blackwater Estuary, UK Bacteroidales; Seashore; Fecal Bacterium Contamination of water systems can not only entail high risks to human health but can also result in economic losses due to closure of beaches and shellfish harvesting areas. Understanding the origin of fecal pollution at locations where shellfish are grown is essential in assessing associated health risks-as well as the determining actions necessary to remedy the problem. The aim of this work is to identify the species-specific source(s) of fecal contamination impacting waters overlying the shellfisheries in the Blackwater Estuary, East Anglia, UK. Over a twelve-month period, water samples were taken from above the oysters and from a variety of upstream points considered to be likely sources of fecal microorganism, together with oyster samples, and the number of fecal streptococci and E. coli were determined. Transition from low to high tide significantly decreased the concentration of fecal streptococci in waters overlying the oyster beds, indicative of a freshwater input of fecal pollution in oyster bed waters. In 12 months, the number of E. coli remained constant throughout, while fecal streptococci numbers were generally higher in the winter months. Analyses of upstream samples identified a sewage outfall to be the main source of E. coli to the oyster beds, with additional fecal streptococci from agricultural sources. The findings may assist in developing approaches for assessing the risks to shellfishery industries of various fecal inputs into an estuary, which could then help local governmental authorities address the problem."
"A multivariate analysis of workplace mentoring and socializing in the wake of #MeToo Crowdsourcing; Personnel; Task Assignment This paper examines workplace mentoring and socializing behaviours in the wake of #MeToo and whether these practices might be associated with womenâ€™s career trajectories. To address this important and timely topic, we fielded two surveys, one to managers (n = 203) and the other to female employees (n = 1,847), asking several questions about mentoring and male/female work interactions. Descriptive statistics show that 32% of the female employee sample report that their views on male/female work interactions are different today than they were 1â€“2 years ago. Multivariate analyses of the manager sample indicate that male managers are significantly less likely than female managers to mentor or interact one-on-one with female employees. The implication of these findings is that female employees may face a mentoring disadvantage in the wake of #MeToo. The adverse effects for career growth and advancement for female employees could be profound."
"Developing the resilient project professional: examining the student experience Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management Purpose: Resilience development during university can increase the likelihood of positive employment outcomes for project management graduates in what is known as a stressful profession where the prevalence of project failure, job insecurity, and burnout is high. However, a focus on student resilience in project management education is scarce. The purpose of this paper is to address this gap by establishing a baseline profile of resilience for project management students, identifying priority areas of resilience development and exploring the relationship between resilience and well-being. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 292 Australian students undertaking project management studies completed a survey comprising of the Resilience at University scale, the Short Warwickâ€“Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale and an item assessing sleep adequacy. Findings: A resilience profile for undergraduate, postgraduate, male and female project management students was calculated. The resilience profile identified differences according to gender, and between undergraduate and postgraduate students. Mental well-being and adequate sleep were found to be significantly related to resilience. Practical implications: Findings support the call for a greater emphasis on resilience development in the project management curriculum for undergraduates and postgraduates. One priority area likely to facilitate resilience is the ability to maintain perspective. As well as supporting academic achievement, it will assist graduates to navigate through complex, uncertain and challenging project environments. Originality/value: This is the first known study of resilience for students undertaking project management studies in higher education."
"Design and implementation of an islanded hybrid microgrid system for a large resort center for Penang Island with the proper application of excess energy Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems The energy demand is growing daily at an accelerated pace due to the internationalization and development of civilization. Yet proper economic utilization of additional energy generated by the Islanded Hybrid Microgrid System (IHMS) that was not consumed by the load is a major global challenge. To resolve the above-stated summons, this research focuses on a multi-optimal combination of IHMS for the Penang Hill Resort located on Penang Island, Malaysia, with effective use of redundant energy. To avail this excess energy efficiently, an electrical heater along with a storage tank has been designed concerning diversion load having proper energy management. Furthermore, the system design has adopted the HOMER Pro software for profitable and practical analysis. Alongside, MATLAB Simulink had stabilized the whole system by representing the values of 2068 and 19,072 kW that have been determined as the approximated peak and average load per day for the resort. Moreover, the optimized IHMS is comprehended of Photovoltaic (PV) cells, Diesel Generator, Wind Turbine, Battery, and Converter. Adjacent to this, the optimized system ensued in having a Net Present Cost (NPC) of $21.66 million, Renewable Fraction (RF) of 27.8%, Cost of Energy (COE) of $0.165/kWh, CO2 of 1,735,836 kg/year, and excess energy of 517.29MWh per annum. Since the diesel generator lead system was included in the scheme, a COE of $0.217/kWh, CO2 of 5,124,879 kg/year, and NPC of $23.25 million were attained. The amount of excess energy is effectively utilized with an electrical heater as a diversion load."

"Marine protected areas ineffectively protect seagrass and coral reef fish communities in the Phu Quoc and An Thoi archipelago, Vietnam Marine Protected Areas; Marine Parks; Environmental Protection The Phu Quoc marine protected area (MPA) is a multiple-use MPA that was established in 2007 and is a component of Vietnamâ€™s National MPA System. The MPA is divided into two spatially separated zones based on habitat type: a seagrass zone and a coral reef zone. In this study, visual census data were collected in 2018â€“2019 and were used to derive fish biomass and community diversity metrics as proxies for ecosystem condition and function (trophic and mobility). The effectiveness of the MPA in protecting fish communities in the seagrass and coral reef zones was evaluated. An updated characterization of the Phu Quoc fish communities, and an assessment of fish community variation among regions and between habitat types, is provided. In total, 125 species representing 74 genera of 40 families were recorded. Omnivores were the most abundant (38%), followed by planktivores (24%), whereas piscivores (2%) were scarce. There was an especially low density of high-value fishery target species such as Haemulidae (<0.01%), Carangidae (<0.2%), Lethrinidae (<0.3%), Lutjanidae (<0.4%), Serranidae (<2%), and Chaetodontidae (<3%). Alarmingly, fishes with a total length of >20 cm only accounted for 1% of the total individuals. Species and functional composition were similar between protected and unprotected areas but differed among regions and between habitats. These results suggest that the protection of fishes provided by Phu Quoc MPA at the time of this study was ineffective. The taxonomic composition of fish communities has remained relatively unchanged over the last approximately 25 years, with the density of large fishes and commercial species remaining low. There is capacity to improve MPA performance by providing adequate resources for threat management and using evidence-based decision-making in management. The 2020 rezoning and expansion of the Phu Quoc MPA is discussed with regards to prioritizing biodiversity and coverage targets."

"Parking Availability Prediction with Long Short Term Memory Model Parking; Internet Of Things; Cruising Traffic congestion causes heavily energy consumption, carbon dioxide emission and air pollution in cities, which is usually created by cars searching on-street parking spaces. Drivers are likely to move slowly and waste time on the road for an available on-street parking space if parking slot availability information is not revealed in advanced. Therefore, it is necessary for city councils to provide a car parking availability prediction service which could inform car drivers vacant parking slots before they start the journey. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on recurrent network and use the long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict parking multi-steps ahead. The core idea of this framework is that both the occupancy rate of on-street parking in a specific region and car leaving probability are exploited as prediction performance metric. A large real parking dataset is used to evaluate the proposed approach with extensive comparative experiments. Experimental results shows the proposed model outperform the state-of-art model."
"Properties and environmental impact of the mosaic sludge incorporated into fired clay bricks Cement; Clay Brick; Sewage This paper presents fundamental information on the utlization of mosaic sludge waste from industrial mosaic activities into building materials. The study greatly benefits solid waste management and industries that produce waste with high heavy metal concentration by providing insights on ways to dispose waste by minimizing heavy metal leaching potential whilst providing a new formulation of low-cost and environmentally friendly building materials. Therefore, an alternative disposal method is to incorporate mosaic waste such as bodymill sludge (BS) and polishing sludge (PS) into fired clay brick. The bricks were incorporated with different percentages (0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% by weight) of sludge waste and fired at 1050 Â°C (0.7 Â°C/min heating rates). The optimization results showed that the incorporation of up to 30% of mosaic sludge into fired clay bricks is capable of improving its physical and mechanical properties. Moreover, the incorporation of mosaic sludge waste into clay bricks has a positive effect on firing shrinkage, density and compressive strength. However, a decreased performance was reported for certain aspects. Hence, this study demonstrated that BS and PS can be alternative low-cost and environmentally friendly which can be used to improve the physical and mechanical properties of fired clay bricks."
"Importance – Performance Analysis (IPA) of metro service attributes during the COVID-19 pandemic Public Transport; Motor Vehicles; Passengers Background: The study of user satisfaction with public transport services is of key interest for enhancing public transport ridership. However, the elevated risks of virus transmission on public transport associated with COVID-19 have resulted in a shift towards private vehicles. This issue is of concern to policymakers due to reduced levels of public transport use and increased private vehicle trips. Thus, it is relevant to re-evaluate attributes impacting user satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic to understand how this compares to related research undertaken before the pandemic. Methodology: Through a survey of 507 Tehran Metro users, the structural patterns among 33 metro service attributes were determined using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). A service quality model of the Tehran Metro service (including cleanliness, ventilation/temperature, congestion, operation hours, ticket, information, reliability, and safety) was then designed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Attributes and latent constructs were classified using Importance â€“ Performance Analysis (IPA). Findings: Attributes associated with general congestion in the metro, the performance of the metro during peak hours, cleanliness, and temperature/ventilation were found to be among the most influential attributes during the pandemic. Conclusion: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, time and cost effectiveness were key attributes affecting the choice of travel mode. Due to the outbreak of the virus, safety and health have been identified as the main attributes affecting the choice of travel mode. In this research, with a case study of the Tehran metro, it was found that there is a shift in attributes affecting service quality towards cleanliness, congestion and temperature/ventilation. As a result, a range of policies is needed to deal with the effect of COVID-19 on metro services. These include: increasing the number of metro services, reducing the time interval between metro services, improving air conditioning, and regular cleaning of vehicles. Policymakers can use the results of this study to improve user satisfaction with metro services and increase ridership levels during the pandemic."
"Techno-economic Evaluation of a 29-kW Micro-grid Hybrid Photovoltaic System for a Healthcare Center in Bangladesh Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems A micro-grid solar hybrid photovoltaic (PV) system has been designed for powering the remote healthcare center located at Charbhadrashan Upazila, Faridpur district in Bangladesh. Geographically, Bangladesh is a promising country for PV technologies, having an average of 4.5 kWh/m2/d solar insolation. The selected location for the work is an island into the mighty Padma River where the electric connection is not reliable for 24 hours service of a hospital. The considered roof-top PV system is comprised of 350 W solar panels, bi-directional inverter, generator, connecting wires, mounting system, and related accessories. In this assessment, state-of-the-art PV design software, HOMER Powering Health Tool has been utilized for estimating the load requirements, techno-economic and environmental evaluation of the micro-grid system. The load analysis revealed that a 29-kW grid-connected solar PV system is required for the hospital and the estimated net present cost (NPC) is US$29, 846, with a Levelized cost of energy is $0.045. Renewable electricity contributed 98% of this system's power requirement and the grid contributed only 2%. The annual production of this 25-year PV system is 43, 642 kWh/year and per unit, the electricity production cost is $0.058 which is significantly lower than today's average per-unit cost of $0.082 in Bangladesh. Besides, the system reduces 34.9 tons of CO2 emissions per year. Thus, this analysis suggested that the grid-connected PV system is a better configuration among other power sources for providing electricity to the health clinics in the absence of no electricity."
"Cycling behaviour in 17 countries across 6 continents: levels of cycling, who cycles, for what purpose, and how far? Bicycling; Bike; Cyclist International comparisons of cycling behaviour have typically been limited to high-income countries and often limited to the prevalence of cycling, with lack of discussions on demographic and trip characteristics. We used a combination of city, regional, and national travel surveys from 17 countries across the six continents, ranging from years 2009 through 2019. We present a descriptive analysis of cycling behaviour including level of cycling, trip purpose and distance, and user demographics, at the city-level for 35 major cities (>1 million population) and in urbanised areas nationwide for 11 countries. The Netherlands, Japan and Germany are among the highest cycling countries and their cities among the highest cycling cities. In cities and countries with high cycling levels, cycling rates tend to be more equal between work and non-work trips, whereas in geographies with low cycling levels, cycling to work is higher than cycling for other trips. In terms of cycling distance, patterns in high- and low-cycling geographies are more similar. We found a strong positive association between the level of cycling and womenâ€™s representation among cyclists. In almost all geographies with cycling mode share greater than 7% women made as many cycle trips as men, and sometimes even greater. The share of cycling trips by women is much lower in geographies with cycling mode shares less than 7%. Among the geographies with higher levels of cycling, children (<16 years) are often overrepresented. Older adults (>60 years) remain underrepresented in all geographies but have relatively better representation where levels of cycling are high. In low-cycling settings, females are underrepresented across all the age groups, and more so when older than 16 years. With increasing level of cycling, representation of females improves across all the age groups, and most significantly among children and older adults. Clustering the cities and countries into homogeneous cycling typologies reveals that high cycling levels always coincide with high representation of females and good representations of all age groups. In low-cycling settings, it is the reverse. We recommend that evaluations of cycling policies include usage by gender and age groups as benchmarks in addition to overall use. To achieve representation across different age and gender groups, making neighbourhoods cycling friendly and developing safer routes to school, should be equally high on the agenda as cycling corridors that often cater to commuting traffic."
"Towards high carbon conversion efficiency by using a tailored electrodialysis process for in-situ carboxylic acids recovery Electrodialysis; Membrane; Desalination Production of carboxylic acids from anaerobic fermentation has gained increasing attention. However, acidogenic fermentation is still facing challenges such as low yield of carboxylic acids and difficulties in product recovery and purification. The emission of acidogenic off-gas CO2 leads to a reduced carbon recovery (âˆ¼70%) and also increases the carbon footprint of the anaerobic treatment process. In this study, a tailored electrodialysis stack was integrated with a fermenter to recover the products and hence to improve quantity and quality of the produced carboxylic acids. Three levels of currents, i.e., 0.4, 1, and 4 A (T1, T2, and T3), were applied during electrodialytic separation of carboxylic acids and 12 cycles of electrodialysis were carried out to evaluate the performance of the integrated system. Results showed that different degrees of carboxylic acids removal led to varied impacts on the yield of carboxylic acids, economic viability, and the instability of microbial community. Compared with the case without coupling electrodialysis process, the carbon conversion rate increased by 28.04% in T3, which was due to the reuse of inorganic carbon introduced by a tailored electrodialysis process. After 12 cycles of fermentation, the percentage of Clostridiales finally increased from 0.11% (inoculum) to 31.15% in T3, which also confirmed the possible autotrophic acidogenesis by using inorganic carbon. This work would provide a promising solution to improve the recovery of carboxylic acids from organic wastes and achieve minimum carbon footprint in the organic waste management process."
"Readily tunable surface plasmon resonances in gold nanoring arrays fabricated using lateral electrodeposition Lithography; Nanospheres; Fabrication Generation and fine-tuning of surface plasmon resonances is a prerequstite for several established and emerging applications such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis, photothermal therapy, surface-enhanced spectroscopy, sensing, superlensing and lasing. We present a low-cost and scalable lateral electrodeposition method for fabrication of high aspect ratio gold nanoring arrays that exhibit multiple surface plasmon resonances in the visible to near-infrared region. Nickel disc arrays of 2 Âµm size were initially fabricated using maskless lithography and e-beam evaporation. Selective electrodeposition of gold on the lateral surfaces of nickel disc arrays was achieved using a 50 nm SiO2 film as an insulating mask. Growing from miniscule 100 nm wide lateral surfaces of nickel discs, nanorings with height up to 1084 nm could be obtained with their thickness and aspect ratio governed by the duration of electrodeposition. Facile tuning of the number of plasmon resonances, their resonant wavelength and relative intensity is demonstrated with applications in plasmon mediated photocatalysis and surface-enhanced Raman scattering."
"Nano/microplastics: Fragmentation, interaction with co-existing pollutants and their removal from wastewater using membrane processes Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Nano: and microplastic (NP/MP) is one of the most challenging types of micropollutants, coming from either direct release or degradation of plastic items into ecosystems. NP/MP can adsorb hazardous pollutants (such as heavy metals and pharmaceutical compounds) and pathogens onto their surface that are consumed by humans, animals, and aquatic living organisms. This paper presents the interaction of NP/MP with other pollutants in the water environment and mechanisms involved to enable the ultimate fate of NP/MP as well as the effectiveness of metal-organic frame (MOF)-based membrane over conventional membrane processes for NP/MP removal. It is found that conventional membranes could remove MPs when their size is usually more than 1000 nm, but they are ineffective in removing NPs. These NPs have potentially greater health impacts due to their greater surface area. MOF-based membrane could effectively remove both NP and MP due to its large porous structure, high adsorption capacity, and low density. This paper also discusses some challenges associated with MOF-based membranes for NP/MP removal. Finally, we conclude a specific MOF-based ultrafiltration membrane (ED-MIL-101 (Cr)) that can potentially remove both negative and positive charged NP/MP from wastewater by electrostatic attraction and repulsion force with efficient water permeability."
"The Thucydides Trap as an Alternative Explanation for the US–China Trade War Aid; Official Development Assistance; International Cooperation The current trade war between the USA and China is perceived to be motivated by the US desire to curtail the bilateral trade deficit, on the assumption that reducing the deficit boosts economic growth. This flawed proposition indicates gross misunderstanding of the national income identity and the basic principles of macroeconomics. The imposition of tariffs will not reduce the trade deficit as the assumptions and conditions required for a smooth working of the process are unrealistic and counterfactual. The notion of an economic Thucydides trap is put forward to explain why the trade war is motivated by US apprehension about Chinaâ€™s rising economic power."
"The climate just city Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Cities are increasingly impacted by climate change, driving the need for adaptation and sustainable development. Local and global economic and socio-cultural influence are also driving city redevelopment. This, fundamentally political, development highlights issues of who pays and who gains, who decides and how, and who/what is to be valued. Climate change adaptation has primarily been informed by science, but the adaptation discourse has widened to include the social sciences, subjecting adaptation practices to political analysis and critique. In this article, we critically discuss the just city concept in a climate adaptation context. We develop the just city concept by describing and discussing key theoretical themes in a politically and justice-oriented analysis of climate change adaptation in cities. We illustrate our arguments by looking at recent case studies of climate change adaptation in three very different city contexts: Port Vila, Baltimore City, and Karlstad. We conclude that the social context with its power asymmetries must be given a central position in understanding the distribution of climate risks and vulnerabilities when studying climate change adaptation in cities from a climate justice perspective."
"Atomically Thin Ga2S3 from Skin of Liquid Metals for Electrical, Optical, and Sensing Applications Molybdenum Disulfide; Monolayer; Van Der Waals Intriguing physical and chemical properties of atomically thin semiconductors provide avenues for the development of the next-generation electronics, optoelectronics, and sensing applications. However, many materials are intrinsically nonlayered and therefore difficult to obtain in two dimensions (2D) due to the presence of strong in-plane bonds. Here, we adopted liquid metal synthetic strategies to produce 2D gallium sulfide (Ga2S3), which is an intrinsically nonlayered material. The obtained monoclinic Î±-Ga2S3 has a relatively high field-effect mobility of 3.5 cm2 V-1 s-1 and features a p-type material with a bandgap of 2.1 eV. Photodetectors that are made based on these synthesized 2D Ga2S3 exhibit relatively strong photodetectivity of 1010 jones and photoresponsivity of 240 A W-1 in visible wavelengths. The 2D Ga2S3 is also found to be suitable for sensing of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas at low evaluated temperatures. Excellent electronic, optical, and gas sensing performance demonstrated in this work offers great promises for synthesizing high quality 2D materials based on the liquid metal framework."
"Internet of Things: The Potentialities for Sustainable Agriculture Internet Of Things; Food Supply Chain; Agricultural Products Internet of Things (IoT) technology has a substantial role to play in promoting sustainable agriculture and food production. SMEs are playing a leading role in this space. Tools that allow continuous monitoring and decision making for example regarding the use of fertilisers or water consumption are being applied in various parts of the world by SMEs as in Vietnam and Australia, to undertake sustainable agriculture and food production. The aim in this article is to provide an overview of the latest technology which has been developed and applied in this space. Through the consideration of examples of applications, the resulting implications and impacts for example relating to water and energy use are provided. The potential for reducing environmental impacts while creating sustainable agriculture and food production from the perspective of technological applications by SMEs is discussed with broader environmental impact considerations."
"The economic benefits of reductions in nitrogen loads from stormwater runoff by street trees Stemflow; Interception; Throughfall It is increasingly recognised that urban trees can contribute to reducing stormwater runoff by intercepting and retaining a fraction of rainfall received. What is less studied is the translation of this to reduced pollutant loads being transferred to receiving streams, rivers, and water bodies. In this paper, we assess interception of two tree species (Eucalyptus microcorys and Ulmus procera) in an urban park. These data are used in simple water balance modelling to predict the environmental and economic benefit of reducing nitrogen loads to receiving waterways as a function of reduced runoff volume resulting from rainfall interception by urban trees on public land (21% of the catchment area). We use a highly urbanized catchment in Melbourne, Australia to demonstrate the impact of an urban forest dominated by deciduous trees, evergreen trees or a mixed tree canopy cover. We found that doubling the urban canopy cover in the catchment, while keeping the current mix ratio of deciduous and evergreen trees, could reduce annual runoff volume by 30 mm (92 MLyrÌ„1). Using the prescribed values that developers must pay the local water authority for nitrogen treatment as a condition of new development, we calculate that this would deliver a nitrogen load removal benefit of AUD$ 200/tree. If only deciduous trees are planted, the annual runoff reduction would decrease to 24 mm (73 MLyrÌ„1) and increases to 37 mm (112 MLyrÌ„1) if only evergreen trees are planted. This study highlights both the additional benefits of public street trees and the differences in deciduous and evergreen trees which should be accounted for by policy makers."
"Influence of human activities on broad-scale estuarine-marine habitats using omics-based approaches applied to marine sediments Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus Rapid urban expansion and increased human activities have led to the progressive deterioration of many marine ecosystems. The diverse microbial communities that inhabit these ecosystems are believed to influence large-scale geochemical processes and, as such, analyzing their composition and functional metabolism can be a means to assessing an ecosystemâ€™s resilience to physical and chemical perturbations, or at the very least provide baseline information and insight into future research needs. Here we show the utilization of organic and inorganic contaminant screening coupled with metabolomics and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess the microbial community structure of marine sediments and their functional metabolic output. The sediments collected from Moreton Bay (Queensland, Australia) contained low levels of organic and inorganic contaminants, typically below guideline levels. The sequencing dataset suggest that sulfur and nitrite reduction, dehalogenation, ammonia oxidation, and xylan degradation were the major metabolic functions. The community metabolites suggest a level of functional homogeneity down the 40-cm core depth sampled, with sediment habitat identified as a significant driver for metabolic differences. The communities present in river and sandy channel samples were found to be the most active, with the river habitats likely to be dominated by photoheterotrophs that utilized carbohydrates, fatty acids and alcohols as well as reduce nitrates to release atmospheric nitrogen and oxidize sulfur. Bioturbated mud habitats showed overlapping faunal activity between riverine and sandy ecosystems. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria and lignin-degrading bacteria were most abundant in the sandy channel and bioturbated mud, respectively. The use of omics-based approaches provide greater insight into the functional metabolism of these impacted habitats, extending beyond discrete monitoring to encompassing whole community profiling that represents true phenotypical outputs. Ongoing omics-based monitoring that focuses on more targeted pathway analyses is recommended in order to quantify the flux changes within these systems and establish variations from these baseline measurements."
"Seeking Justice and Redress for Victim-Survivors of Image-Based Sexual Abuse Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica Despite apparent political concern and actionâ€”often fuelled by high-profile cases and campaignsâ€”legislative and institutional responses to image-based sexual abuse in the UK have been ad hoc, piecemeal and inconsistent. In practice, victim-survivors are being consistently failed: by the law, by the police and criminal justice system, by traditional and social media, website operators, and by their employers, universities and schools. Drawing on data from the first multi-jurisdictional study of the nature and harms of, and legal/policy responses to, image-based sexual abuse, this article argues for a new joined-up approach that supports victim-survivors of image-based sexual abuse to â€˜reclaim controlâ€™. It argues for a comprehensive, multi-layered, multi-institutional and multi-agency response, led by a government- and industry-funded online or e-safety organisation, which not only recognises the diversity of victim-survivor experiences and the intersection of image-based sexual abuse with other forms of sexual and gender-based violence and discrimination, but which also enables victim-survivors to reclaim control within and beyond the criminal justice system."
"OPCAT monitoring and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Decision Making; Disability Committee; UN Convention OPCAT (Optional Protocol for the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment) monitoring involves regular visits to places of detention in order to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is now well established in international law that social care, disability, health and mental health settings are places where torture and ill treatment can occur. In addition, it has been recognised that torture and ill treatment in international law encompass a range of practices and experiences that were previously overlooked. The idea that routine practices in care settings might be characterised as â€˜tortureâ€™ is controversial because these actions are generally thought to be motivated by the need to cure, help or protect people in care. This article analyses the contemporary definitions of torture in the context of social, disability health and health care settings, arguing that the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is prompting further expansion of the definition of torture and ill-treatment, requiring additonal attention to the circumstances and experiences of people with disabilities in all contexts. The article discusses the implications of evolving international standards for OPCAT monitoring in Australia."
"Bittersweet? Urban proximity and wine tourism in the Swan Valley Region Wine; Hedonic Price Function; Implicit Price Proximity to the target market is deemed desirable for tourism destinations, including wine-tourism. Yet, it also translates into a range of problems. While research into wine regions has exponentially grown over the last two decades, the majority of research in wine tourism focuses on the demand side with little attention to supply side dynamics that impact development. This paper considers the realities of the supply side of a wine tourism region, i.e. the perspectives of business owners, service providers and authorities, and reports on the perceptions and challenges as noted by a range of stakeholders in the Swan Valley in Western Australia as a distinct wine tourism area. The study highlights how proximity to an urban market can be a major challenge for an industry based on agri-business in a rural setting. The research has policy implications for local and state authorities, particularly in terms of alignment relating to land-use and infrastructure."
"Educators' experiences and strategies for responding to ecological distress Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Climate Change; Skepticism Research is increasingly identifying the issues of ecological distress, eco-anxiety and climate grief. These painful experiences arise from heightened ecological knowledge and concern, which are commonly considered to be de facto aims of environmental education. Yet little research investigates the issues of climate change anxiety in educational spaces, nor how educators seek to respond to or prevent such emotional experiences. This study surveyed environmental educators in eastern Australia about their experiences and strategies for responding to their learners' ecological distress. Educators reported that their students commonly experienced feeling overwhelmed, hopeless, anxious, angry, sad and frustrated when engaging with ecological crises. Educators' strategies for responding to their learners' needs included encouraging students to engage with their emotions, validating those emotions, supporting students to navigate and respond to those emotions and empowering them to take climate action. Educators felt that supporting their students to face and respond to ecological crises was an extremely challenging task, one which was hindered by time limitations, their own emotional distress, professional expectations, society-wide climate denial and a lack of guidance on what works."
"Income inequality and renewable energy consumption: Time-varying non-parametric evidence Environmental Kuznets Curve; China; Trade Openness We examine the effect of income inequality on renewable energy consumption, and its disaggregated components, for a panel of 17 nations over the period 1990 to 2016. We assess this relationship in a dynamic framework by tracing the time-varying evolution using non-parametric techniques. This framework enables us to pin down, at each point in time, the effect of income inequality on renewable energy and how the relationship evolved over time. The results show a time-varying effect, where for a short period between 1995 and 2002, the relationship was negative. From 2010 onwards the relationship then switches to positive. We also observe heterogeneous effects of income inequality depending on the measure of renewable energy used. The time-varying effects reflect that income inequality influences renewable energy consumption via various channels, and at specific times, some channels appear to be more dominant. Thus, the findings from this study highlight the need for policymakers to pay close attention to the role of income inequality when developing policies for the uptake of or transition to renewable energy, and particularly the need to be dynamic with policy formulation, taking into account the channels through which income inequality works."
"Dynamic Analysis of Flexible Wind Turbine Tower by a Transfer Matrix Method Offshore Wind Turbines; Dynamic Response; Soil-Structure Interaction To generate more power, wind turbine rotors are growing in size and consequently, wind turbine tower are becoming increasingly taller and more flexible. As a result, fluid-structure interaction (FSI) of the flexible tower caused by strong wind is a very important phenomenon, and tower vibration must be carefully considered. In this paper, the physical model of the wind turbine tower is simplified appropriately, and then a multi-body dynamics model of wind turbine tower system is established based on Transfer Matrix Method of Multibody System (MSTMM). Compared with the data from finite element model (FEM) and field tests, the simulation results show that the model has a good accuracy. By coupling the mode shapes with two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) wake oscillator model, the dynamic responses of the flexible tower are computed. The influence of various foundation stiffness and top mass on tower vibration is studied systematically using this model. The results indicate that different boundary conditions can affect the maximum amplitude and displacement along the axis of the tower. This work provides a reference for dynamic modeling and simulation of high-rise flexible structure, and the prediction of the maximum amplitude of the tower vibration, which can be used for aeroelastic control purpose."
"Tales from Camp Wilde: Queer(y)ing Environmental Education Research (Revisited) Autoethnography; Feminism; Sexual and Gender Minorities Following Constance Russell, Tema Sarick, and Jacqueline Kennellyâ€™s (Can J Environ Educ 7(1):54â€“66, 2002) pioneering foray into the generative possibilities of mobilizing queer theorizing in environmental education, we were encouraged to follow them a short time later with our own collaborative explorations of this academic territory (Gough et al., Can J Environ Educ 8:44â€“66, 2003) in a special issue of the Canadian Journal of Environmental Education (CJEE) on â€œExploring New Genres of Inquiry in Environmental Education Research,â€ and we are now pleased to revisit this work. The first part of this chapter is a reprint of that 2003 article. We explore some possibilities for queer(y)ing environmental education research by fabricating (and inviting colleagues to fabricate) stories of Camp Wilde, a fictional location that helps us to expose the facticity of the fieldâ€™s heteronormative constructedness. These stories suggest alternative ways of (re)presenting and (re)producing both the subjects/objects of our inquiries and our identities as researchers. At the end, we offer some brief reflections on Camp Wildeâ€™s inception and reception, together with some speculations on where we might go next."
"Do economic openness and institutional quality influence patents? Evidence from GMM systems estimates Intellectual Property Rights; Patent Protection; Patents By using GMM estimators for unbalanced panel data, we examine the effects of institutional quality, trade openness, and FDI flows on innovation in 84 countries for the period between 1996 and 2014. Our results show that, although institutional quality appears as a vital driver for patent applications, FDI flows and trade openness have different influences. Precisely, higher inward FDI flows have a positive effect on the number of patents whereas trade openness might have a negative one. We afterwards discuss the influence of institutional quality on these two effects by showing that the effects of economic openness are enhanced by the improvement of institutional quality. These results are important for policy makers in setting-up the short-run and long-run policies to sustain economic growth."
"Spatio-temporal assessment of social resilience to tropical cyclones in coastal Bangladesh Bangladesh; Cyclonic Storms; Disaster Tropical cyclones wreak havoc on the lives of coastal populations, especially in marginalised communities in developing countries where cyclone impacts are disproportionately lethal compared to developed countries. These populations must implement measures that enable them to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyclone impacts. Using empirical evidence, this study presents a spatio-temporally explicit, index-based assessment technique to assess social resilience to tropical cyclones. The key components of social resilience were extracted by Principal Component Analysis; distinct resilience indices were generated and mapped for the three disaster phases. The most influential components were then aggregated into an Effective Social Resilience Index (ESoRI), which was mapped across the study area. The technique was applied in a coastal sub-district of Bangladesh to demonstrate the approach. Basic preparedness training, emergency response, social bonding, and reconstruction and rehabilitation strongly influenced resilience in ways that corresponded closely to the phases of the disaster-management cycle: preparedness, response, and recovery. The spatial pattern of resilience revealed that social resilience varies significantly in time and space within a circumscribed locale. Importantly, areas close to the sea and rivers were found to be more resilient despite their high exposure to cyclones and lack of external support. This study will guide policymakers concerned with resilience building on a priority basis such as those working in resource-scarce conditions of developing countries."
"Gender relations and social media: a grounded theory inquiry of young Vietnamese women’s self-presentations on Facebook Vietnam; Intimate Partner Violence; Sexual Health Since the introduction of Äá»•i Má»›i (market economic reforms) in 1986, Vietnam has experienced rapid social, cultural, economic and technological changes. The purpose of this study is to explore the nexus between gender relations and social media with a focus on how young urban Vietnamese women present themselves on Facebook. Grounded theory was employed to inquire into this phenomenon, revealing that the participants use various self-presentation techniques (strategies) including an ideal appearance, competency (mastery) and a positive image. The participantsâ€™ self-presentations were found to be simultaneously influenced by Confucian ethics, socialist ideology and neoliberal global culture. The intersection of these social forces has changed the nature of gender relations and expectations for young Vietnamese women, leading to the emergence of a neoliberal gendered self in their presentations on Facebook. This study foregrounds how gender relations in early twenty-first century Vietnam are being reconfigured by competing values and how these can be analyzed through and influenced by social media use."
"Blockchain technology and its role in enhancing supply chain integration capability and reducing carbon emission: A conceptual framework Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things Most current blockchain and carbon emission studies are from engineering and sciences disciplines. By incorporating blockchain technology into supply chain integration capabilities, the firms are be able to work collaboratively with each other to enhance the supply chain integration and simultaneously reduce the carbon emission in a supply chain. This paper presents a conceptual framework to understand the role of blockchain in a low carbon supply chain management. Applying the Socio-Technical Theory and Resource-Based View, the research propositions between blockchain, supply chain integration capability and carbon emission are proposed in the research framework. The results indicate that the blockchain technology may be viewed as a strategic management approach to enhance supply chain integration and reduce the carbon emissions. In addition, it may be adopted as an operational tool to track carbon footprint, streamline processes and improve efficiency of carbon management to minimize the overall emissions in supply chains. The paper contributes to the blockchain literature and its applications in low carbon supply chain management and provides recommendation for future research."
"Integrative Herbal Medicine for Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy and Hand-Foot Syndrome in Colorectal Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Chemotherapy; Oxaliplatin; Goshajinkigan Objectives: To assess the clinical evidence for integrative herbal medicine therapy in the management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and hand-foot syndrome (HFS) resulting from treatments for colorectal cancer (CRC). Design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from major English and Chinese databases. Participants had been diagnosed with CRC by pathology and had received or were undergoing chemotherapy. Interventions included herbal medicines administered orally or topically. Controls were placebo, supportive care or conventional chemotherapy for CRC. Methods followed the Cochrane handbook. Meta-analyses were grouped by study design, outcome measure, severity, and chemotherapy. Random-effects models with 95% confidence intervals were used. Heterogeneity was assessed as I 2 . Results: Sixty-three RCTs (4286 participants) were included. Five used a placebo in the control groups. Fifty-eight studies tested oral herbal medicine, and 5 tested topical herbal medicine. Data were available for CIPN (60 studies) and HFS (12 studies). Fifty-seven studies combined orally administered herbal medicine with chemotherapy compared with the same chemotherapy. For CIPN, 33 studies used World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, 7 used Leviâ€™s criteria, and 10 used the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE). These were analyzed separately. For grades III + IV CIPN, there was a significant reduction in the integrative groups for WHO (relative risk [RR] 0.42 [0.23, 0.77], I 2 = 0%) and Leviâ€™s (RR 0.28 [0.11, 0.69], I 2 = 0%) but not NCI-CTCAE (RR 0.65 [0.37, 1.13], I 2 = 26.4%). Hand and foot baths showed no differences for Leviâ€™s grades III + IV CIPN but a significant reduction in all grades (RR 0.69 [0.50, 0.95], I 2 = 68.8%). For HFS (all grades) there was a significant reduction in the integrative groups for WHO (RR 0.62 [0.41, 0.96], I 2 = 22%) but not for NCI-CTCAE (RR 0.93 [0.55, 1.55], I 2 = 75.7%). Sensitivity analyses explored sources of heterogeneity. Conclusions: Integrative herbal therapy appeared to reduce CIPN and HFS in people receiving chemotherapy for CRC. However, the strength of the evidence was limited by lack of blinding in most studies, potential for bias, and relatively short study durations."
"Bamboo as an alternative bioenergy crop and powerful ally for land restoration in Indonesia Culms; Phyllostachys Edulis; Plantation The energy demand in Indonesia has increased significantly with its population growth, urbanization, and economic development. The growing concern of meeting energy demand while reducing dependency on fossil fuels has resulted in an increasing demand for renewable energy. As a country with a rich biomass base, bioenergy is now an important component of Indonesia's energy agenda. However, a crucial problem in bioenergy production is the selection of species that can provide a sustainable supply of feedstock without having an impact on food security and the environment. In this context, we discuss the characteristics and benefits of using bamboo, a perennial grass, as a potential species for bioenergy feedstock in Indonesia. We describe the fuel characteristics of bamboo along with the possibility to align its cultivation, production, and usage with environmental and developmental agendas which makes it a suitable bioenergy crop in the country. In addition, its ability to grow on degraded lands, fast growth, long root system, and easy maintenance prove it as a powerful ally for the restoration of degraded land. We recommend in-depth research on the social, ecological, and economic feasibility of using this species for bioenergy production."
"The causative relationship between natural resource rent and economic growth: evidence from Ghana’s crude oil resource extraction Resource Curse; Economic Growth; Extractive Industries Purpose: While the relationship between natural resource rent and economic growth is well documented in the literature, not much robust analysis has been done to estimate the causative relationship between oil resource rent and economic growth in Ghana. This might be due to the fact that commercial production of crude oil started not long ago in Ghana. This paper aims to examine the causal relationship between oil resource rent and economic growth for the period of 2011 to 2020 in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The study incorporates economic growth as a function of oil resource rent, non-oil revenue, foreign direct investment, capital and interest rate in a Cobbâ€“Douglass production function/model. The study used four different estimation strategies including the autoregressive distributed lags model, Todaâ€“Yamamoto test approach, nonlinear autoregressive distributed lags model and nonlinear Granger causality. Findings: The main finding revealed that 1% increase in oil resource rent generates 0.84% increase in economic growth of Ghana in the long run. Contrary, the authors find an insignificant positive effect of oil resource rent on economic growth of Ghana in the short run for the period under study. The result from the Todaâ€“Yamamoto test approach also showed a unidirectional causality running from oil resource rent to economic growth of Ghana, providing evidence in support of the resource blessing hypothesis in Ghana. The results are robust to two different alternative estimation strategies. Originality/value: The causal relationship between crude oil resource rent and economic growth is examined."
"International education and graduate employability: Australian Chinese graduates’ experiences Employability; Competency; Soft Skills This article investigates how international educational experiences affect the employment opportunities of Chinese who graduated from an Australian university. Findings based on 26 semi-structured interviews highlight that Chinese students who graduated from Australia gained a web of capital (i.e., human, cultural, psychological and identity), which facilitated their employment upon return home. However, social capital, which is critical in China, was a weakness for Chinese students who graduated from overseas institutions. The findings have provided strong evidence that Chinese studentsâ€™ employability benefited from studying overseas. This research utilised the Tomlinsonâ€™s Graduate Capital Model to an international education context. It has implications for Chinese students on how they could benefit from studying overseas and for universities that recruit Chinese international students."
"Potential for sustainable utilisation of agricultural residues for bioenergy production in Pakistan: An overview Pakistan; Renewable Energy Policy; Fossil Fuel Pakistan's current energy portfolio is problematic due to a lack of proper management and implementation of appropriate energy policies. This densely populated country has a high energy demand that rises yearly and is expected to increase three-fold by 2050. However, fossil fuel resources are continuously depleting by global overuse while negatively impacting the environment through increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This study reviewed the potential for agricultural residues to be used as renewable energy sources for bioenergy production in Pakistan to address the energy-related challenges that would also help in addressing the economic and environmental concerns. First, a comparison was made between the current energy situation, potential renewable energy scenarios, and global trends. Second, greenhouse gas (i.e., CO2) emissions in Pakistan were summarised and compared with other regions. Third, the thermochemical properties of different agricultural residues were reviewed along with varying the options of processing to produce renewable energy such as thermochemical conversion approaches (combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and liquefaction) and biochemical conversion options (anaerobic digestion, and fermentation). Pakistan being an agricultural-based economy, produces vast quantities of agricultural residue biomass, which is mostly underutilized as animal feed, conventional fuel substitutes, left to rot in fields or burnt to get rid, resulting in the vast emissions of greenhouse gases causing severe environmental pollution and smog formation. A considerable share of Pakistan's national energy demand can be fulfilled if these feedstocks are adequately managed and exploited through the energy sector and converted into large-scale bioenergy."
"Identifying critical enablers for homeownership in Hong Kong Home Ownership; Housing Tenure; Real Estate Market Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive assessment of the influential factors that must be considered in an effort to enhance homeownership. Design/methodology/approach: A list of 14 factors identified through the literature were assessed through a questionnaire survey with 502 useful responses. The data collected were analysed using mean item score (MIS), exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: MIS analysis revealed â€œprioritizing lending towards first-time buyersâ€, â€œreforming planning process to allow building of more homesâ€ and â€œintroducing subsidies for all first-time buyersâ€ as the most influential factors affecting homeownership. Using EFA, 3 key factors were generated from the 14 factors: subsidies and policy reforms; fiscal measures; and monetary measures. The SEM results show that all three factors have a significant positive effect on homeownership at different levels. Originality/value: This paper empirically examines the enabling factors for homeownership in Hong Kong, revealing a clear effect of various group factors on homeownership. The paper proposes practical and policy recommendations to improve homeownership rate."
"Combined method limiting shrinkage-swelling behaviours of expansive soils in Huai'an, China Unsaturated Soil; Soil Water Characteristic; Suction Controlling the swelling and shrinkage deformation of expansive soil is essential for the design of earth structures surrounded by expansive soils. Swelling and shrinkage deformation could induce severe damages (i.e. cracks and/or distortion) to infrastructures-for example, embankments, pavements and pipelines. In this study, a series of laboratory tests and a field trial on expansive soils in Huai'an, China were conducted to investigate their shrinkage-swelling cycle characteristics. A technology combining quicklime stabilisation and surcharge pressure was proposed to limit the shrinkage-swelling deformation of Huai'an expansive soil in a highway embankment project. The experimental and field test results show that (a) the swelling potential of Huai'an expansive soil increased with an increase in the number of drying-wetting cycles without surcharge pressure; (b) the swelling potential decreased with an increase in the magnitude of surcharge pressure; (c) the addition of quicklime to Huai'an expansive soil combined with surcharge pressure could reduce the swelling potential significantly; and (d) the shear strength of expansive soil samples decreased as the number of drying-wetting cycles increased. The measured settlement from the field test indicated that the proposed technique can reduce the swelling potential and control the heaving of Huai'an expansive soil effectively."
"Detecting covert communities in multi-layer networks: A network embedding approach Community Detection; Complex Network; Modularity Graph clustering is a fundamental task to discover community ties in multi-layer networks. In this paper, we propose a network embedding technique to find covert communities in multi-layer dark networks using a Log-BiLinear (LBL) approach. Recent works on graph clustering using network embedding have focused on new ways of learning representations of nodes and relations, upon which a classic clustering method is then used to identify the communities (clusters). However, these embedding approach does not yield good and accurate communities from the clustering task. Hence, we address this issue with a sequence-based network embedding technique on a multi-layer network. Our proposal learns structural representations of nodes and relations simultaneously by capturing the position of a given node within a set of neighboring anchor-set, and the type of connections between nodes in the anchor-set. To find the clusters (communities), clustering centroids are also learned as the representations of nodes and relations are extracted. Our solution is well-suited to detecting covert communities, such as terrorist networks. In our experiments on three real-world terrorist datasets and one synthetic network, our approach is found to deliver a higher level of accuracy in detecting covert communities compared with six baseline methods."
"Comparative psychophysics of colour preferences in two species of non-eusocial Australian native halictid bees Bombus; Bees; Foragers Colour signalling by flowers appears to be the main plant-pollinator communication system observed across many diverse species and locations worldwide. Bees are considered one of the most important insect pollinators; however, native non-eusocial bees are often understudied compared to managed eusocial species, such as honeybees and bumblebees. Here, we tested two species of native Australian non-eusocial halictid bees on their colour preferences for seven different broadband colours with bee-colour-space dominant wavelengths ranging from 385 to 560 nm and a neutral grey control. Lasioglossum (Chilalictus) lanarium demonstrated preferences for a UV-absorbing white (455 nm) and a yellow (560 nm) stimulus. Lasioglossum (Parasphecodes) sp. showed no colour preferences. Subsequent analyses showed that green contrast and spectral purity had a significant positive relationship with the number of visits by L. lanarium to stimuli. Colour preferences were consistent with other bee species and may be phylogenetically conserved and linked to how trichromatic bees processes visual information, although the relative dearth of empirical evidence on different bee species currently makes it difficult to dissect mechanisms. Past studies and our current results suggest that both innate and environmental factors might both be at play in mediating bee colour preferences."
"Airline Value Chain Capabilities and CSR Performance: The Connection Between CSR Leadership and CSR Culture with CSR Performance, Customer Satisfaction and Financial Performance Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy This research examines Corporate Social Responsibility in Leadership (CSRL) and Culture (CSRC) as valuable resources of the value chain capabilities, and its influence on CSR Performance (CSRP), as well as its resulting effect on Customer Satisfaction (CS) and Financial Performance (FP) in the context of the airline industry. CSR entails the practice of social and environmental activities. These activities mainly concentrate on improving the relationships of a firm with its stakeholders, which consist of shareholders, charitable and community organisations, employees, suppliers, customers, and the environment (Sprinkle and Maines, 2010). It is therefore in this context that this research adopts the concept of CSR which consists of two aspects of social and environmental sustainability. Based on the traditional value chain model by Porter of the mid 1980's, this research however also focuses on other robust and contemporary business thinking such as culture and leadership within the CSR setting. Three carriers in the aviation industry within the US and Asia Pacific markets are analysed and some resulting academic and managerial implications are discussed. Findings from this research highlights the importance of cultivating and promoting CSR culture and leadership so as to positively influence CSR performance, which can in turn enhance other aspects of firm performance specifically customer satisfaction and financial performance. Hence, this research provides incentives for managers to invest in CSR in their quest for sustainable performance. Building on the hypothesis that firms achieve sustainable performance and ultimately financial performance through the identification of value chain capabilities such as CSRL and CSRC, the findings of this research indicate that there is a strong requirement for sustainable firm performance in the current environment but this can only be achieved where the approach is embedded in the core business, by CSR leaders who can apply the concepts of value creation through a strong CSR culture. This research is original as it is perhaps one of the first studies which examine the linkage between CSR-related constructs of leadership, culture and performance."
"Housing wealth, mortgages and Australians’ labour force participation in later life Home Ownership; Housing Wealth; Real Estate Market In the life cycle model of consumption and saving, homeownership is an important vehicle for horizontal redistribution. Households accumulate wealth in owner-occupied housing during working lives before benefiting from imputed rent streams in retirement. But in some countries housing wealthâ€™s welfare role has broadened as owners increasingly use flexible mortgages to smooth consumption during working lives. One consequence is higher outstanding mortgages later in life, a burden exacerbated by high real house prices that compel home buyers to demand mortgages that are a growing multiple of their incomes. We investigate whether these developments are prompting longer working lives, an idea that is especially relevant in countries offering relatively low government pensions. Australia is one such country. We use the 2001â€“2017 panels of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey to estimate hazard models of exits from the Australian labour force as workers approach pensionable age. We find that those with high outstanding mortgage debts are more likely to postpone retirement, as are those with relatively low amounts of private pension wealth. These results are stronger in urban housing markets, and especially among males."
"Working with ‘illiberal’ sources of peace and order: Talking about human rights Melanesia; Vanuatu; Papua New Guinea Lack of human rights observance and accountability are often put forward by donor agencies as key reasons for not engaging positively with societal sources of order, security and justice in post-colonial states. Discussing issues of gender violence in Vanuatu in particular, this chapter argues for a dialogic approach to engaging across significant differences of power and culture on questions of the systemic imposition of suffering. The chapter argues that this is both a more productive way of working against abuse, but may also be fundamental to understanding and working with human rights. This approach encourages a subtle but significant shift to more relational, dynamic approaches to understanding and promoting human rights."
"Potential of plasmonic microreactor for Photothermal hydrogen-enriched fuel production from biomethane Fischer-Tropsch Reaction; Catalyst; Synthesis Gas In the present article, a series of coupled computational physics - fluid dynamics models were developed aiming at assessing the feasibility of photothermal synthetic fuel production from biogas (biomethane) and steam blends using plasmonic nanostructure Ag/TiO2 substrate (each, 0.1 Î¼m in thickness) inside a thermal, momentum and mass transport boundary layer in a microreactor. A chain of partial and complete biogas reforming and water-gas shift reactions were modelled as the dominant chemical reactions responsible for synthetic fuel production from biomethane. Using equilibrium analysis, plausible thermodynamic operating conditions were identified and applied to the computational models. The effect of light wavelength (Î») on the reaction rate, chemical conversion extent, syngas quality, exergy partitioned in synthetic fuel, and composition of gas products were investigated. The results showed that the performance of the microreactor is wavelength-dependent. It was found that the highest production rate for the synthetic fuel was achieved at 580 nm < Î» < 620 nm. Within the same wavelength range, the chemical conversion of biomethane to synthetic fuel reached 85% at steam to methane ratio of 3 and the synthetic fuel quality was >2.05, which is suitable for a Fischer-Tropsch process. It was also identified that the syngas quality of the synthetic fuel can be regulated by adjusting the wavelength of the light. The exposure time was also identified to be a critical parameter affecting the performance of the microreactor. For an exposure duration of up to 10 ns, high quality of synthetic fuel >2.05 can be achieved within the optimum wavelength range of 580 nm < Î» < 620 nm."
"SERS and fluorescence-based ultrasensitive detection of mercury in water Catalytic DNA; Aptasensors; Genetic Procedures The development of reliable and ultrasensitive detection marker for mercury ions (Hg2+) in drinking water is of great interest for toxicology assessment, environmental protection and human health. Although many Hg2+ detection methods have been developed, only few offer sensitivities below 1 pM. Herein, we describe a simple histidine (H) conjugated perylene diimide (PDI) bolaamphiphile (HPH) as a dual-responsive optical marker to develop highly selective and sensitive probe as visible (sol-to-gel transformation), fluorescence and SERS-based Hg2+sensor platform in the water. Remarkably, HPH as a SERS marker supported on Au deposited monodispersed nanospheres monolayers (Au-MNM) of polystyrene offers an unprecedented selectivity and the best ever reported detection limit (LOD) of 60 attomolar (aM, 0.01 parts-per-quadrillion (ppq)) for Hg2+ in water. This is ten orders of magnitude lower than the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) tolerance limit of Hg2+ in drinking water (10 nM, 2 ppb). This simple and effective design principle of host-guest interactions driven fluorescence and SERS-based detection may inspire the future molecular engineering strategies for the development of ultrasensitive toxic analyte sensor platforms."
"Metal-Air Transistors: Semiconductor-Free Field-Emission Air-Channel Nanoelectronics Electrode; Emitters (Equipment); Electron Sources Scattering-free transport in vacuum tubes has always been superior to solid-state transistors. It is the advanced fabrication with mass production capability at low cost which drove solid-state nanoelectronics. Here, we combine the best of vacuum tubes with advanced nanofabrication technology. We present nanoscale, metal-based, field emission air channel transistors. Comparative analysis of tungsten-, gold-, and platinum-based devices is presented. Devices are fabricated with electron beam lithography, achieving channel lengths less than 35 nm. With this small channel length, vacuum-like carrier transport is possible in air under room temperature and pressure. Source and drain electrodes have planar, symmetric, and sharp geometry. Because of this, devices operate in bidirection with voltages <2 V and current values in few tens of nanoamperes range. The experimental data shows that influential operation mechanism is Fowler-Nordheim tunnelling in tungsten and gold devices, while Schottky emission in platinum device. The presented work enables a technology where metal-based switchable nanoelectronics can be created on any dielectric surface with low energy requirements."
"Exploring apprenticeship learning for player modelling in interactive narratives Interactive Narrative; Artificial Intelligence; Storytelling In this paper we present an early Apprenticeship Learning approach to mimic the behaviour of different players in a short adaption of the interactive fiction Anchorhead. Our motivation is the need to understand and simulate player behaviour to create systems to aid the design and person-alisation of Interactive Narratives (INs). INs are partially observable for the players and their goals are dynamic as a result. We used Receding Horizon IRL (RHIRL) to learn playersâ€™ goals in the form of reward functions, and derive policies to imitate their behaviour. Our preliminary results suggest that RHIRL is able to learn action sequences to complete a game, and provided insights towards generating behaviour more similar to specific players."
"Selective laser melting of duplex stainless Steel 2205: Effect of post-processing heat treatment on microstructure, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Additive manufacturing (AM) is a rapidly growing field of technology. In order to increase the variety of metal alloys applicable for AM, selective laser melting (SLM) of duplex stainless steel 2205 powder and the resulting microstructure, density, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance were investigated. An optimal set of processing parameters for producing high density (> 99.9%) material was established. Various post-processing heat treatments were applied on the as-built predominantly ferritic material to achieve the desired dual-phase microstructure. Effects of annealing at temperatures of 950 Â°C, 1000 Â°C, 1050 Â°C, and 1100 Â°C on microstructure, crystallographic texture, and phase balance were examined. As a result of annealing, 40-46 vol.% of austenite phase was formed. Annealing decreased the high yield and tensile strength values of the as-built material, but significantly increased the ductility. Annealing also decreased the residual stresses in the material. Mechanical properties of the SLM-processed and heat-treated materials outperformed those of conventionally produced alloy counterparts. Using a scanning strategy with 66Â° rotation between layers decreased the strength of the crystallographic texture. Electrochemical cyclic potentiodynamic polarization testing in 0.6 M NaCl solution at room temperature showed that the heat treatment improved the pitting corrosion resistance of the as-built SLM-processed material."
"Synthesis of biodiesel from chicken skin waste: an economic and environmental biofuel feedstock in Bangladesh Transesterification; Catalyst; Rubber Seed Oil One of the dominating meat supply industries, the poultry chicken sector, is facing waste management concerns worldwide. Due to high oil content containment, biofuel researchers emphasized poultry waste as abundant, cheap, and high-quality feedstock for biodiesel production. Therefore, in the current study, an experimental investigation of biodiesel production from wasted chicken skin through the transesterification process has been performed. The chicken skin used in this study for biodiesel production can be used as the potential waste source for biodiesel production worldwide. Techno-economic, environmental, and sustainability analyses were also performed. During the synthesis, the reaction was conducted with potassium hydroxide (KOH), and the process yielded 48% biodiesel. The cost of electricity for providing electricity is estimated at US$0.575 per kWh when an auto-sized generator has been fueled by biodiesel. The environmental and substantiality analysis found that biodiesel is more suitable than conventional diesel as an environmentally friendly and sustainable fuel."
"Real-Time UAS Guidance for Continuous Curved GNSS Approaches Helicopter; A-6 Aircraft; Airspace This paper presents new efficient guidance algorithms allowing Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) to avoid a variety of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) continuity and integrity performance threats detected by an Aircraft Based Augmentation System (ABAS). In particular, the UAS guidance problem is formulated as an optimal control-based Multi-Objective Trajectory Optimization (MOTO) problem subject to suitable dynamic and geometric constraints. Direct transcription methods of the global orthogonal collocation (pseudospectral) family are exploited for the solution of the MOTO problem, generating optimal trajectories for curved GNSS approaches in real-time. Three degrees-of-freedom aircraft dynamics models and suitable GNSS satellite visibility models based on Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation ephemeris data are utilised in the MOTO solution algorithm. The performance of the proposed MOTO algorithm is evaluated in representative simulation case studies adopting the JAVELIN UAS as the reference platform. The paper focusses on descent and initial curved GNSS approach phases in a Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) scenario, where multiple manned/unmanned aircraft converge on the same short and curved final GNSS approach leg. The results show that the adoption of MOTO based on pseudospectral methods allows an efficient exploitation of ABAS model-predictive augmentation features in online GNSS guidance tasks, supporting the calculation of suitable arrival trajectories in 7 to 16 s using a normal PC."
"Transmedia Activism and Future Dreaming: Big hART’s Yijala Yala Comics; Graphic Novels; Superheroes While Jenkinsâ€™s original conceptualization of transmedia refers to interconnected components of fictional narrative storyworlds (2006), Lina Srivastava expands the possibilities for change through grounding transmedia in community, participation and story (2016a). This chapter discusses Yijala Yala, an eight-year project based around the remote and predominantly Indigenous town of Roebourne in north-west Australia and teases out ideas around grassroots community collaboration, story-telling across platforms and mediums, and long-range impacts and change. In framing Big hARTâ€™s longitudinal project within a context participatory practices and activism, I underpin these works in relation to Jenkinâ€™s concept of transmedia, claiming that the principles can equally be applied more broadly to the concept of place as world."
"Feminism as Epic Theory Alexis De Tocqueville; Democracy; American Exceptionalism Sheldon Wolin identifies a particular tradition within political theory that he calls 'epic theory'. Epic theory, he explains, is political theory's equivalent of the Kuhnian scientific revolution. This article takes up the analogy between epic theory and scientific revolution to show that feminism is an epic theory in the truest sense of the term, a sense not fully grasped by Wolin. It is so for two reasons. First, it is a theory of the whole. Second, it is less a discovery than an invention of the world. The author seeks to account for the existence of feminism in the face of its impossibility, and to demonstrate the magnitude of the achievement that feminism represents."
"Independent Mental Health Advocacy: A Model of Social Work Advocacy? Community Treatment Orders; Psychiatry; Health Act Advocacy has received less attention in social work research than other aspects of social work practice. This paper draws attention to two tensions in social work advocacy; between worker-led advocacy and person-led advocacy, and between individual advocacy and system level advocacy. We argue that human-rights-based social workers must choose a person-led approach over a worker-led approach while advocating with both systems and individuals. This argument is made by drawing on findings of an evaluation of Independent Mental Health Advocacy (IMHA) in Victoria, Australia. It is shown that social work training had not prepared social workers for rights-based, person-led advocacy and that social workers in public mental health services were struggling to maintain the rights of people in their services even with assistance from IMHA. IMPLICATIONS Independent Mental Health Advocacy (IMHA) is a model of advocacy influenced by social work theory and delivered in part by social-work-trained advocates. Social work training is not preparing social workers for person-led, human-rights-based advocacy. Public mental health social workers are struggling to maintain the rights of people in mental health services even with the support of external advocacy services."
"Fate of road-dust associated microplastics and per- and polyfluorinated substances in stormwater Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Emerging contaminants such as microplastics (MPs) and per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) in the water environment have been documented as the major environmental threat due to their negative impact on the ecosystem. Road dust has been recognised as a potential source of these emerging pollutants in stormwater which are eventually released into open water bodies. The aim of this study was to identify the existence of MPs and PFAS in Australian road dust and stormwater samples. We found that different MP types such as polyethylene, nylon, polyester and cotton were identified in the stormwater samples. The main type of MPs in stormwater was microfibres which accounted for more than 50 %. It was also found that PFAS was detected in Australian road dust from industrial and heavily trafficked areas. Although there was no PFAS in stormwater in the selected industrial and heavy traffic study area, they can be found in airport and defence sites. This study indicated that road dust acts as the potential origin of MPs and PFAS in urban stormwater runoff."
"Additive manufacturing of specific ankle-foot orthoses for persons after stroke: A preliminary study based on gait analysis data Foot Orthoses; Ankle; Orthotic Devices The aim of present study is to investigate the feasibility of patient-specific ankle-foot orthoses fabricated using additive manufacturing (AM) techniques. Then, clinical performance of the AFOs manufactured using material PA12 was evaluated in stroke survivors based on gait analysis data. The ankle and foot were scanned by EinScan-Pro 3D scanner. The software Geomagic Studio was used for modifying the AFO model. After processing the original AFO model into the final required model, material PA12 were used to fabricate the AFOs by Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) technique. Finally, gait analysis of 12 stroke patients was conducted to compare the effects with and without AFO. It took 2 hours from processing the initial AFO model to the completion of final model, and the printing time was 8 hours. The printing thickness of the AFO was 1.2 mm. With respect to the temporal-spatial parameters, the velocity and stride length in the gait with AFO increased significantly as compared to the gait without AFO (P = 0.001, P = 0.002). The cadence increased, double limb support phase decreased, and the step length difference decreased in the gait with AFO; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.117, P = 0.075, P = 0.051). This study confirmed the feasibility of patient-specific AFO fabricated by AM techniques, and demonstrated the process of modifying AFO models successfully. The specific ankle-foot orthoses fabricated by material PA12 have a significant effect on the improvement of velocity and stride length in people with stroke."
"Sustainable developments and corporate social responsibility in Vietnamese fashion enterprises Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate the status of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility in fashion enterprises in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is qualitative in nature and utilized a multiple case study approach (questionnaires and face-to-face interviews) to achieve the objectives of the research. NVivo was used to analyze the data. Findings: Findings showed that by collaborating with the local artisans to create the unique clothing lines, the fashion brands try to blend and upscale the traditional indigenous clothing styles with modern design concepts to promote the diversity of Vietnamese ethnic culture. The findings also suggest that both the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large enterprises (LEs) should maintain their corporate social responsibility (CSR) concepts to comply with the legal obligations such as salary and welfare benefits for employees, work safety, gender equality and promotions. Further, the CSR activities should address the social issues with their target stakeholders, particularly with the local communities. Originality/value: This study sought to provide a snapshot on the current sustainable practices followed in Vietnamese fashion enterprises."
"Recent advances in heterogeneous catalyst design for biorefining Biomass; Levulinic Acids; Ethyl Levulinate Biorefineries are a new concept in chemical manufacturing in which naturally occurring, sustainable biomass resources such as forestry and agricultural waste are converted to diverse fuel and chemical product streams, akin to the processing of non-renewable fossil fuels by petrochemical refineries. Biomass derived from waste agricultural and forestry materials or non-food crops offers the most easily implemented and economical solutions for transportation fuels, and the only nonpetroleum route to organic molecules for the manufacture of bulk, fine, and speciality chemicals necessary to secure the future needs of society. The successful implementation of biorefineries can address concerns over dwindling oil reserves, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel sources and associated climate change, and will be underpinned by catalytic processes to facilitate the co-production of platform chemicals and biofuels. Catalysis is a central theme in sustainable chemistry, lowering energy and resource requirements while minimising waste production. In contrast to fossil-derived crude oil, which has low oxygen content, the high oxygen and water content of biomass feedstocks presents challenges for their utilisation and requires innovations in catalyst and process design for the selective conversion of these hydrophilic, bulky feedstocks into fuels or high-value chemicals. This article highlights how methods to control porosity, solid acid and base character, and surface hydrophobicity are essential components of a toolkit for the design of heterogeneous catalysts for biomass processing."
"Microbial exposure drives polyclonal expansion of innate γδ T cells immediately after birth Butyrophilins; Intraepithelial Lymphocytes; T-Cells Starting at birth, the immune system of newborns and children encounters and is influenced by environmental challenges. It is still not completely understood how Î³Î´ T cells emerge and adapt during early life. Studying the composition of T cell receptors (TCRs) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in neonates, infants, and children can provide valuable insights into the adaptation of T cell subsets. To investigate how neonatal Î³Î´ T cell repertoires are shaped by microbial exposure after birth, we monitored the Î³-chain (TRG) and Î´-chain (TRD) repertoires of peripheral blood T cells in newborns, infants, and young children from Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. We identified a set of TRG and TRD sequences that were shared by all children from Europe and Africa. Thesewere primarily public clones, characterized by simple rearrangements of VÎ³9 and VÎ´2 chains with low junctional diversity and usage of non-TRDJ1 gene segments, reminiscent of early ontogenetic subsets of Î³Î´ T cells. Further profiling revealed that these innate, public VÎ³9VÎ´2+ T cells underwent an immediate TCR-driven polyclonal proliferation within the first 4 wk of life. In contrast, Î³Î´ T cells using VÎ´1+ and VÎ´3+ TRD rearrangements did not significantly expand after birth. However, different environmental cues may lead to the observed increase of VÎ´1+ and VÎ´3+ TRD sequences in the majority of African children. In summary, we show how dynamic Î³Î´ TCR repertoires develop directly after birth and present important differences among Î³Î´ T cell subsets."
"Transnational crime and its trends in South-East Asia: A detailed narrative in Vietnam Human Trafficking; Sexual Exploitation; Prostitution While implementing economic and political reforms to develop society and the economy since 1986, Vietnam has faced serious challenges to national security and social order associated with the complexities of transnational crimes (e.g., illegal drugs, human trafficking, green crimes and high-tech crimes). Additionally, as an uncharted territory in the field of criminology and policing, overall assessment of these crimes in Vietnam is still absent. Lack of knowledge and background on transnational crimes in Vietnam is considered one of the barriers to full understanding of the nature of cross-border criminals in comparison to other South-East Asian countries. This study analyses specific characteristics and modus operandi of transnational crimes in Vietnam by examining these particularly severe crimes. Findings show there are sophisticated cunning associated with flexible activities to avoid law enforcement monitors. Findings call for further research to inform policymakers and scholars."
"Renewable thermal energy driven desalination process for a sustainable management of reverse osmosis reject water Distillation; Direct Contact; Membrane A sustainable circular economy involves designing and promoting products with the least environmental impact. This research presents an experimental performance investigation of direct contact membrane distillation with feed approaching supersaturation salinity, which can be useful for the sustainable management of reverse osmosis reject water. Traditionally, reject water from the reverse osmosis systems is discharged in the sea or in the source water body. The reinjection of high salinity reject water into the sea has the potential to put the local sea environment at risk. This paper presents a design of a solar membrane distillation system that can achieve close to zero liquid discharge. The theoretical and experimental analysis on the performance of the lab scale close to zero liquid discharge system that produces supersaturated brine is studied. The lab-based experiments were conducted at boundary conditions, which were close to the real-world conditions where feed water temperatures ranged between 40â—¦C and 85â—¦C and the permeate water temperatures ranged between 5â—¦C and 20â—¦C. The feed water was supplied at salinity between 70,000 ppm to 110,000 ppm, similar to reject from reverse osmosis. The experimental results show that the maximum flux of 17.03 kg/m2Â·h was achieved at a feed temperature of 80â—¦C, a feed salinity of 10,000 ppm, a permeate temperature of 5â—¦C and at constant feed and a permeate flow rate of 4 L/min. Whereas for the same conditions, the theoretical mass flux was 18.23 kg/m2Â·h. Crystal formation was observed in the feed tank as the feed water volume reduced and the salinity increased, reaching close to 308,000 ppm TDS. At this condition, the mass flux approached close to zero due to crystallisation on the membrane surface. This study provides advice on the practical limitations for the use of membrane distillation to achieve close to zero liquid discharge."
"DIY Entrepreneurship? – Self-reliance for Women Refugees in Australia Migrant Workers; Self-Employment; Ethnic Business In this paper, we call for a re-examination of the self-reliance ideology based on a neoliberal perspective to make policies for refugee women's (self-)employment and integration. We use a social constructionist perspective to conduct a narrative analysis of data from the lived experience of twelve women refugee entrepreneurs. Three prominent themes emerge from the womenâ€™s own narratives of their entrepreneurial journey â€“ self-reconstruction, social capital, and resilience. Our findings reveal the complexities of self-reconstruction and socialization as experienced by refugee women entrepreneurs â€“ for whom â€œpushâ€ factors take precedence over â€œpullâ€ factors with the explicit understanding that the onus is on them to survive with their own resilience. We argue that offering people hope of a new life means offering them meaningful choices, built on forms of economic activity whose sustainability over the long term is evidenced by the positive supports available to make sure economic activity succeeds."
"Determining house prices in data-poor countries: Evidence from Ghana Spatial Regression; House Price Index; Property Prices In many developing countries, house price index construction is sparse, leaving decisions which hinge on housing performance data with little corroboratory evidence. Thus, the purpose of this research is to ascertain the micro-level determinants of house prices in Ghana. Using a qualitative approach, data are collected through semi-structured interviews with twenty expert property practitioners including valuers, academics, property developers, mortgage providers and housing agents. This research uncovers interesting findings including the relevance of unexpired lease terms, and the impacts of market dynamics such as the physical heterogeneity of properties and hearsay. The study also reveals that an index needs to be created and managed through a collaborative effort between the government and industry to ensure wide acceptability. This study lends guidance to housing policy decisions at the local and national levels, and provides a much-needed source of data for further academic inquiry into the housing dynamics in Ghana."
"A Dynamic Robust Restoration Framework for Unbalanced Power Distribution Networks Distribution Network; Reconfiguration; Distributed Generation The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generators has led to a reduction in the effectiveness of existing strategies for restoring the power distribution network. This article proposes a dynamic robust restoration (DRR) framework for the recovery of outage power considering uncertain PV outputs and demands. This framework is presented in two subsequent steps. In the first step, optimal decisions regarding the network configurations are generated. The second step then computes the modified dynamic Distflow equations and constraints under consideration of the worst operating conditions over the associated uncertainty sets with the aim of maximizing the recovery of outage power. The DRR model is formulated as a bilevel mixed-integer linear programming problem. A decomposition algorithm in a master-sub structure is used to solve the resulting system. The results of case studies show that the proposed DRR model yields obvious advantages over the existing deterministic dynamic restoration model in terms of robustness against system uncertainties."
"Sensitivity of a Large and Representative Sample of Antarctic Marine Invertebrates to Metals Toxicity; Aquatic Organisms; Environmental Assessment There are limited data on the sensitivity to contaminants of marine organisms in polar regions. Consequently, assessments of the risk of contaminants to marine biota in polar environments typically include extrapolations from temperate and/or tropical species. This is problematic because the taxonomic composition of organisms differs between polar and temperate/tropical waters, and both the toxicity of chemicals and the physiology of organisms are very different at the stable low temperatures experienced in polar marine systems. Collecting high-quality sensitivity data for a wide range of marine polar organisms using traditional toxicity assessment approaches is a time-consuming and difficult process, especially in remote and hostile environments. We applied a rapid toxicity testing approach, which allowed a much larger number of species to be tested than would be possible with traditional toxicity test methods, albeit with lower replications and fewer exposure concentrations. With this rapid approach, sensitivity estimates are less precise, but more numerous. This is important when constructing species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), which aim to represent the sensitivity of communities. We determined the approximate sensitivity (4- and 10-d median lethal concentration [LC50] values) of a large and representative sample of Antarctic marine invertebrates to copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd). Up to 88 LC50 values (from 88 different taxa) were used in the construction of SSDs. The hazardous concentrations for 1% of taxa (HC1) based on 10-d LC50 values were 37, 346, and 792 Î¼g/L for Cu, Zn, and Cd, respectively. Our results provide a basis for estimating the risk of exposure to metals for a large representative sample of marine polar invertebrates. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1560â€“1568. Â© 2019 SETAC."
"Supercritical water technology: an emerging treatment process for contaminated wastewaters and sludge Supercritical; Batch Reactors; Hydrothermal The destruction of toxic, persistent, refractory, and hazardous organic compounds, often present at high concentrations in both industrial and municipal wastewaters, remains a major challenge to be overcome, mainly due to the inefficiencies of conventional processes. Notwithstanding, the search for novel treatment methods has received great attention recently. Supercritical water technology has proved to be a very promising treatment method for contaminated wastewaters and sludges. Performances of supercritical water technology in treating wastewaters from a wide variety of industries including pulp and paper, pharmaceutical, textile, pesticides, dairy, petrochemical, explosives, and distillery were reviewed. Furthermore, the effects of main operating conditions, namely temperature, pressure, residence time on the treatment efficiency, usually reported in terms of total organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand removal were summarized. In addition, well-known technical challenges faced by supercritical water processes such as corrosion, salt deposition, clogging, elevated running costs and possible solutions to mitigate those challenges have been discussed. At last, the future scope of the supercritical water technology is expected to be driven by policies aiming at the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, environmental protection, mitigation of climate changes and the production of commercial gases from highly efficient treatment of contaminated organic wastewaters and sludges."
"Stories and standards: The impact of professional social practices on safety decision making Whistleblowing; Personnel; Fraud Organisational influences on safety outcomes are the subject of much attention in both academia and industry with a focus on how workplace factors and company systems, both formal and informal, influence workers. Many individuals who make important decisions for safety are not simply employees of a particular firm, but also members of a profession. This second social identity is little studied or acknowledged and yet is it critical for safety. This chapter addresses two key social practices that influence safety outcomes. The first is professional learning for disaster prevention. Research has shown that much professional learning is profoundly social including sharing stories and using stories directly as an input to key decisions. Another critical professional activity is development of standards. Standards are seen as authoritative sources and so â€˜called upâ€™ in legislation and yet the processes by which they are developed are opaque to those outside the small group of professionals involved. Again, this important social practice of groups of professionals remains little studied. Professional social practices such as these are worthy of much more attention from both academia and industry."
"Reducing inequities in early childhood mental health: How might the neighborhood built environment help close the gap? a systematic search and critical review Health Impact Assessment; Health Equity; Policy Making Background: Optimal mental health in early childhood is key to later mental health, physical health, education, and social outcomes; yet, children facing disadvantage tend to have worse mental health and fewer opportunities to develop this foundation. An emerging body of research shows that neighborhoods provide important opportunities for the development of childrenâ€™s mental health. Synthesizing this evidence can advance understandings of the features of the neighborhood built environment (e.g., housing, parks) that (1) promote optimal mental health in childhood and (2) reduce mental health inequities. Methods: We systematically searched and critically reviewed the international quantitative literature investigating associations between the neighborhood built environment and young childrenâ€™s mental health. Results: 14 articles met inclusion criteria; most examined nature or public open space. Studies tended to find greater access to or quantity of neighborhood nature or public open space were associated with better mental health. Significant gaps included a lack of studies investigating social infrastructure, and few studies examined how the built environment related to positive mental health (i.e., functioning, rather than problems). Conclusions: Current evidence suggests there is some relationship, but additional research is needed that addresses these gaps and examines differences in associations between child subgroups (e.g., diverse socioeconomic backgrounds)."
"How to navigate the evolving world of clinical placement: an Australian university collaboration to support clinical supervision Preceptorship; Nursing Students; Mentor Clinical placement is an integral part of medical radiation science student learning and development. Clinical placement provides opportunity for students to apply their theoretical knowledge and enable students to prepare for their future professional practice. Clinical supervisors have a significant role in this process to facilitate student learning on clinical placement. However, clinical supervisors often have little formal training to supervising students on placement and will default to their own previous learning experience. There is a need to provide an educational perspective from tertiary education partners to assist medical radiation practitioners in their role of supervising students. This paper is a collaboration between Australian Nuclear Medicine University partners with the aim to support and educate nuclear medicine technologists, and indeed all medical radiation practitioners to competently fulfil their role regarding student supervision and assessment."
"Semi-transparent perovskite solar cells with a cross-linked hole transport layer Perovskite Solar Cells; Solar Cell; Formamidine Semi-transparent perovskite solar cells (ST-PeSCs) have received great attention because of their excellent performance and promising application in areas such as tandem devices and building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs). Critical across all these applications is achieving both high efficiency and stable photovoltaic performance of such devices. Realizing both of these properties simultaneously has not been possible using device architectures featuring the archetypal doped Spiro-OMeTAD as a hole transport layer (HTL). As such, in this work we explore the use of a solution-processed cross-linked HTL formed from N4,N4â€²-di(naphthalen-1-yl)-N4,N4â€²-bis(4-vinylphenyl)biphenyl-4,4â€²-diamine (VNPB) molecules as an alternative to the conventional Spiro-OMeTAD within an FTO/SnO2/C60-SAM/Perovskite/HTL/MoOx/ultra-thin gold/MoOx ST-PeSC device architecture. Through an optimized multi-step thermal treatment process that maximizes charge extraction and reduces recombination from these devices, we can achieve ST-PeSCs that exhibit record power conversion efficiencies for Spiro-OMeTAD-free devices with average visible transmittance values between 10 and 30%. These devices exhibit comparable efficiencies to their Spiro-OMeTAD counterparts, with the additional benefit that the use of the poly-VNPB as the HTL material provides significant improvements in long-term device stability under both continuous illumination and high humidity conditions."
"Particle-Gaseous pollutant emissions and cost of global biomass supply chain via maritime transportation: Full-scale synergy model Biomass; Supply Chain Design; Biomass Power Environmental and economic issues in the maritime transportation and logistics industry have historically received less stakeholder attention than aviation and overland freight sectors. Stakeholders in the port industry have gradually started paying attention to emissions and cost issues across all the sectors, such as supply chains. Global biomass supply chain is one of the main sectors which has not been addressed in published literature. To address this gap, this study aims to develop a dynamic full-scale synergy model to assess cost-mass flow, particulate matter emissions, and air pollutants for maritime transportation of the global crude palm oil biomass supply chain. Focusing on leading producers of palm oil worldwide, we have analyzed a total of 93 sea routes from Malaysia and Indonesia to main export markets in the US, Europe, and Asia. The analysis distinguishes three freight categories: light, medium-weight, and heavy for different sizes of capacity and types of container ships based on the twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU). The findings highlight the dependency of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions level on other factors such as technology, size, and mass flow used for container ships. The results also show a strong relationship between GHG emitted and the type of container ship in a systemic view. A ship with higher TEU contributes to the higher transported amount and lower GHG emissions in the long term. To conclude, the results would increase port industry stakeholdersâ€™ understanding of developing energy policies and managerial strategies for low cost and low carbon fuels technologies."
"Teaching Control during the COVID-19 Pandemic Psychological Support; Mindfulness; COVID-19 This paper aims to analyze some different solutions that were adopted in control education activities during the pandemic. The authors of this paper are educators in the control education field from different countries on all the continents, who have developed a questionnaire with the idea of collecting data about the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the control education activities. The main objective is to study the diverse alternatives that were used worldwide to perform the online educational activities during that period, such as methodologies, tools, learning management systems (LMS), theoretical exercises, laboratory experiments, types of exams, simulators, software for online lecturing, etc. As a result, comparisons between pre- and during-pandemic educational resources and methods are performed, where useful ideas and discussions are given for the control education community."
"The 4Cs of mass customization in service industries: a customer lens Manufacturing; Postponement; Make-To-Stock Purpose: Increasingly, customers are demanding products that fit their individual needs. Many firms respond by cultivating product individualization via mass customization, often integrating this capability via interactive platforms that connect them with customers. Despite such customization, research to date has lacked cohesion, often taking the organizational, rather than customer, view. The purpose of this paper is to provide inconclusive theorizing in regard to customization from the consumersâ€™ perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The review and synthesis of the literature revealed that co-configuration is an underexplored domain of mass customization. Consequently, an initial conceptualization of co-configuration is developed and compared with current customization strategies. Specifically, the definition and boundary conditions of co-configuration are compared with three domains of mass customization, namely, co-production, co-construction and co-design. This led to the development of research priority areas to establish an agenda for future research on mass customization and its role in customerâ€™ firm relationships. Findings: This paper provides the delineation of four distinct consumer customization strategies, conceptualized in a matrix, and proposes separate customer journey visualizations. In advancing the theoretical understanding by means of a unifying typology, this paper identifies three existing Cs of mass customization (co-production, co-construction and co-design) and focuses specifically on a fourth (co-configuration), identified as an understudied mass customization strategy. Originality/value: This paper extends the previous conceptualizations of mass customization comprising co-production, co-design and co-construction. The proposed typology establishes a foundation for four research priority areas that can improve both academic rigor and practical application."
"Smart mobility adoption: A review of the literature Smart Cities; Big Data; Internet of Things Traffic congestion and air pollution continue to be serious concerns, especially in large cities, and going forward, this is not sustainable. Urban transport around the world is facing challenges, such as air pollution and inefficient use of resources, that often inhibit economic development. Simply building more roads cannot address such challenges. There is a need to integrate the urban infrastructure through smart connectivity. Smart mobility, as a vital cornerstone of a smart city, will potentially reduce traffic jams, commuting times, and road crashes and create an opportunity for passengers to customize their journeys. In fact, planning smart mobility solutions is among the top challenges for large cities around the world. It involves a set of deliberate actions backed by sophisticated technologies. The different elements and dimensions that characterize smart mobility are investigated to depict the overall picture surrounding the smart mobility domain. Additionally, the trends, opportunities, and threats inherent to smart mobility are addressed. There are four segments of smart mobility that are highlighted in this paper: intelligent transport systems, open data, big data analytics, and citizen engagement. These segments are all inter-related and play a crucial role in the successful implementation of smart mobility."
"Energy flow in thermostatted non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations Liquid; Shear Viscosity; Lennard-Jones Energy transfers between internal kinetic and potential energy reservoirs in a simple liquid are studied by setting the temperature of one energy reservoir to a different value from that of the others and computing the resultant energy flows. In the first set of simulations, the x-directional kinetic temperature was artificially raised above the other five, and in the second, the x-directional configurational temperature was artificially raised above the other five. In both cases, external energy flows balanced, but unexpected energy flows between different directional components of the potential energy were observed. Additional simulations showed that these energy flows occurred regardless of the arrangement of thermostats imposed on the six degrees of freedom and the addition of shear. Heat flow between degrees of freedom that were ostensibly at the same temperature was anomalously observed. It was concluded that a different breakdown of the contributions to the configurational energy that is consistent with the definition of the directional configurational temperatures is required."
"Exploring safety management challenges for multi-national construction workforces: a UK case study Personnel; Career Barriers; Employed Women Large construction projects frequently operate with multi-national workforces, utilizing migrant workers to provide both skilled and unskilled labour. Multi-national workforces are also brought together through joint ventures, as companies from different countries collaborate and share their expertise to construct large and complex construction projects. A multi-national joint venture in the UK provides the case study for an examination of the safety management challenges found on such projects. Whilst language and communication issues amongst workers are typically primary concerns, here they have not been prioritized. Instead, findings are presented that illuminate more nuanced and unquantifiable problems that faced the safety management team. An ethnographically informed approach was mobilized, with the lead researcher spending three years on the site with the safety team gathering data. Analysis revealed several challenges: problems with non-UK company compliance with UK legislation and standards; differences in working practices amongst both non-UK workers and their managers; differences associated with national cultures; and problems of poor worker welfare. It is suggested that awareness of these challenges should inform both the way in which such projects are initially contracted, as well as the development of more sophisticated safety management systems that better support multi-national construction projects in practice."
"Direct and indirect carbon emissions in foundation construction – Two case studies of driven precast and cast-in-situ piles Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Precast technique has gained significant reputation in the construction industry due to improved efficiency and reduced construction waste. Pile foundation is often built through driven precast or cast-in-situ construction technique. The two types of pile foundations have been widely utilised in various building construction types. The selection of the piling methods has been largely based on the project scope, soil conditions and availability of resources. However, little research has been conducted on environmental impacts brought by driven precast piles compared to cast-in-situ bored piles. The paper aims to address the research gap by conducting a comparative study to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of driven precast and cast-in-situ piles construction using two case studies in China. A process-based quantification model is developed to measure the major emissions and impacts due to materials, transportation and equipment usage. Results of the study indicated 113.04 and 107.46 kgCO2 per pile per metre of excavated depth for case study A and B respectively. Results of the study also observed a reduction for equipment usage and an increase for transportation in GHG emissions for driven precast piles as compared to cast-in-situ piles. Four scenarios were selected to further investigate the GHG emissions variation. Results indicated that use of sustainable materials can achieve the maximum GHG emissions reduction for both types of pile construction. Transportation distance was recorded as a key factor to be considered in reducing GHG emissions for driven precast piles construction. Results of the study can be effectively utilised to compare life cycle GHG emissions of precast construction with cast-in-situ construction."
"Kinetics, isotherms and adsorption–Desorption behavior of phosphorus from aqueous solution using zirconium–iron and iron modified biosolid biochars Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption Excessive discharge of phosphorus (P) to aquatic ecosystems can lead to unpleasant eutrophication phenomenon. Removal and recovery of P is challenging due to low C/N ratios in wastewater, hence the development of efficient removal and recovery of P strategies is essential. In this study, zirconiumâ€“iron (Zrâ€“FeBC) and iron modified (Feâ€“BC) biosolid biochars were examined to investigate their capacity for the removal of P by batch experiments. The influence of solution pH, biochar dose, initial P concentration, ionic strength, interfering ions and temperature were also studied to evaluate the P adsorption performance of biochars. The P experimental data were best described with pseudo-second order kinetics and the Freundlich isotherm model. The maximum P adsorption capacities were reached to 33.33 and 25.71 mg gâˆ’1 for 24 h by Zrâ€“FeBC and Fe-BC at pH 5 and 4, respectively. Desorption studies were performed to investigate the reusability, cost-effectiveness and stability of the adsorbents Zrâ€“FeBC and Fe-BC. The adsorptionâ€“desorption study suggests that both examined biochars have considerable potentiality as adsorbent candidates in removing as well as recovery of P from wastewaters. Results also reveal that the regenerated Zrâ€“FeBC and Feâ€“BC could be utilized repetitively in seven adsorptionâ€“desorption cycles using NaOH as a desorbing agent, which greatly reduces the P-removal cost from wastewaters. Thus, P enriched biochar could potentially be used as fertilizer in the agriculture sector."
"Microplastic contamination has limited effects on coral fertilisation and larvae Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Microplastics are ubiquitous throughout the world's oceans and contaminate coral reef ecosystems. There is evidence of microplastic ingestion by corals and passive contact with coral tissues, causing adverse health effects that include energy expenditure for particle removal from the tissue surface, as well as reduced growth, tissue bleaching, and necrosis. Here, it was examined whether microplastic contamination impairs the success of gamete fertilisation, embryo development and larval settlement of the reef-building coral Acropora tenuis. Coral gametes and larvae were exposed to fifteen microplastic treatments using two types of plastic: (1) weathered polypropylene particles and (2) spherical polyethylene microbeads. The treatments ranged from five to 50 polypropylene pieces L-1 and 25 to 200 microbeads L-1. Fertilisation was only negatively affected by the largest weathered microplastics (2 mm2), but the effects were not dose dependent. Embryo development and larval settlement were not significantly impacted by either microplastic type. The study shows that moderate-high levels of marine microplastic contamination, specifically particles <2 mm2, will not substantially interfere with the success of critical early life coral processes."
"Decontamination-induced modification of bioactivity in essential oil-based plasma polymer coatings Plasma Polymerization; Polypyrrole; Poly(Furan-Co-Aniline) Plasma polymer coatings fabricated from Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil and its derivatives have been previously shown to reduce the extent of microbial adhesion on titanium, polymers, and other implantable materials used in dentistry. Previous studies have shown these coatings to maintain their performance under standard operating conditions; however, when used in e.g., a dental implant, these coatings may inadvertently become subject to in situ cleaning treatments, such as those using an atmospheric pressure plasma jet, a promising tool for the effective in situ removal of biofilms from tissues and implant surfaces. Here, we investigated the effect of such an exposure on the antimicrobial performance of the Melaleuca alternifolia polymer coating. It was found that direct exposure of the polymer coating surface to the jet for periods less than 60 s was sufficient to induce changes in its surface chemistry and topography, affecting its ability to retard subsequent microbial attachment. The exact effect of the jet exposure depended on the chemistry of the polymer coating, the length of plasma treatment, cell type, and incubation conditions. The change in the antimicrobial activity for polymer coatings fabricated at powers of 20â€“30 W was not statistically significant due to their limited baseline bioactivity. Interestingly, the bioactivity of polymer coatings fabricated at 10 and 15 W against Staphylococcus aureus cells was temporarily improved after the treatment, which could be attributed to the generation of loosely attached bioactive fragments on the treated surface, resulting in an increase in the dose of the bioactive agents being eluted by the surface. Attachment and proliferation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells and mixed cultures were less affected by changes in the bioactivity profile of the surface. The sensitivity of the cells to the change imparted by the jet treatment was also found to be dependent on their origin culture, with mature biofilm-derived P. aeruginosa bacterial cells showing a greater ability to colonize the surface when compared to its planktonic broth-grown counterpart. The presence of plasma-generated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the culture media was also found to enhance the bioactivity of polymer coatings fabricated at power levels of 10 and 15 W, due to a synergistic effect arising from simultaneous exposure of cells to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and eluted bioactive fragments. These results suggest that it is important to consider the possible implications of inadvertent changes in the properties and performance of plasma polymer coatings as a result of exposure to in situ decontamination, to both prevent suboptimal performance and to exploit possible synergies that may arise for some polymer coating-surface treatment combinations."
"Foaming at the mouth: Ingestion of floral foam microplastics by aquatic animals Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Phenol-formaldehyde plastics are used globally as floral foam and generate microplastics that can enter the environment. This study is the first to describe how aquatic animals interact with this type of microplastic, and the resultant physiological responses. We analysed â€œregular foamâ€ microplastics generated from petroleum-derived phenol-formaldehyde plastic, and â€œbiofoamâ€ microplastics generated from plant-derived phenol-formaldehyde plastic. Regular foam and biofoam microplastics showed similar FTIR spectra. Both types of microplastics were consumed by all six invertebrate species tested: the freshwater gastropod Physa acuta, the marine gastropod Bembicium nanum, the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis, adults and neonates of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna, the marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa, and nauplii of the marine crustacean Artemia sp. For all species, the occurrence of ingestion was similar for regular foam and biofoam microplastics. Biofoam microplastics leached more than twice as much phenolic compounds than regular foam microplastics. The leachates from regular foam and biofoam microplastics showed the same acute toxicity to Artemia nauplii (24-h LC50 = 27.4 mg mLâˆ’ 1 and 22.8 mg mLâˆ’ 1, respectively) and D. magna (48-h LC50 = 17.8 mg mLâˆ’ 1 and 15.3 mg mLâˆ’ 1, respectively). However, biofoam microplastic leachate was twice as toxic to embryos of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, compared with leachate from regular foam microplastic (96-h LC50 = 43.8 mg mLâˆ’ 1 vs 27.1 mg mLâˆ’ 1). Using M. galloprovincialis, we show that regular foam microplastic leachate and the physical presence of the microplastics exerted separate and cumulative effects on catalase (CAT) activity, glutathione-s-transferase (GST) activity and lipid peroxidation. Microplastic ingestion did not affect the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Taken together, these results show that phenol-formaldehyde microplastics can interact with a range of aquatic animals, and affect sublethal endpoints by leaching toxic compounds, and through the physical presence of the microplastics themselves."
"“Decent work” in the ready-made garment sector in Bangladesh: The role for ethical human resource management, trade unions and situated moral agency Aristotle; Virtue Ethics; Human Flourishing Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the perspectives of 26 business owners, managers and supervisors on â€œdecent workâ€ (DW) in the ready-made garment (RMG) sector in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative study draws on a framework of ethical human resource management and situated moral agency to establish the ways in which RMG workers are afforded DW. This study uses semi-structured interviews to assess the prospect of DW through applying the ILOâ€™s four-pillar framework of DW. Findings: Findings indicate there is a concern among owners and managers of the need to reconcile internal and external pressures to maintain and improve DW. It is evident that ethical practices and moral agency are not self-initiated but in response to mounting political and legal pressures and those of external stakeholders. Employers favour the concept of workersâ€™ participation committees as one means to communicate and negotiate with workers rather than recognise trade unions. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to six organisations in the RMG sector in Bangladesh, but there are implications for all RMG sector organisations to promote reform and DW for all workers. Practical implications: DW necessitates major national and international stakeholders to negotiate and cooperate to ensure the long-term competitiveness and survival of the Bangladeshi RMG sector. Originality/value: The study calls for reform in a developing country where many workers are denied DW."
"Bringing nature back into cities Urban Biodiversity; Urbanization; Birds Protecting nature is a fundamental aspect of local and Indigenous cultures that has more recently become an urban sustainability goal. The benefits provided by nature to people and other species have sparked an upsurge in research exploring how best to manage existing nature in urban environments. Here we expand this focus by drawing attention to an emerging pathway of research and practice that is engaged with the idea of bringing nature back into cities (BNB). We argue that BNB could be a vital force of the 21st century urban-sustainability agenda. However, the enthusiasm of practitioners and policymakers for incorporating BNB objectives into local and global strategies remains uneven. As interdisciplinary scholars involved with the theory and practice of caring for urban nature, we believe that the time is ripe to present a fresh perspective on seven key areas that can unlock the potential of actions to bring nature back into cities. Specifically, we: (a) argue that the sovereignty of local and Indigenous knowledge-systems be acknowledged and respected; (b) contend that the choice of bringing nature back actions should be driven by inclusive decision-making; (c) discuss advances in ecology that need to be addressed to facilitate the return of nature into cities; (d) outline how the diffusion of innovation theory may assist communication of BNB actions to stakeholders; (e) discuss how built-environment professionals can demonstrate the value of urban infrastructure for BNB; (f) call for longitudinal research to understand, quantify and qualify the benefits of BNB actions and (g) consider solutions needed to address concerns about potential risks and disservices associated with actions to bring nature back into urban environments. Taken together, these perspectives, and the transdisciplinary framework that emerges from them, embody theoretical innovation regarding how to bring nature back into cities and a holistic view of how to make this happen in practice. Bringing nature back into cities has the potential to become an environmentally just and culturally inclusive dimension of the 21st urban sustainability agenda upon which future generations of city-dwellers rely.

"Feasibility analysis of an islanded hybrid wind-diesel-battery microgrid with voltage and power response for offshore Islands Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems Practically feasible and applicable design of a hybrid micro-grid wind-diesel alternative energy system has been demonstrated to get the results to fulfil the load demand of 115 kWh/d and a peak load of 11.2 kW for a small community of Mersing town, Malaysia. The whole optimization process has been conducted with the consideration of meteorological data and the technical specifications of each module by the proper utilization of the iHOGA renewable energy software, DIgSILENT PowerFactory and Matlab Simulink. From the simulation results, it can be observed that the designed and simulated Islanded Hybrid Microgrid System (IHMS) is economically and environmentally feasible, and the simulation results reported as the net present cost, cost of energy and CO2 emission, are being reduced by about 72%, 73.5% and 82% respectively per year compared to the conventional power plant of the Tanjung Bin Energy Power Plant, Johor, Malaysia. Moreover, the voltage, power and frequency responses also checked and compared with the practical results and ensured the stability of the whole energy system. Besides this, the system reliability indices also analysed and reported to ensure the technical and economic feasibility of the designed system. The optimization results reported that the least cost of energy is about USD 0.05/kWh and the net present cost is USD 77,286. The comparison between the analysed hybrid energy system and conventional energy systems has been reported properly to justify the importance of renewable energy resources all over the world. This optimized combination of the hybrid alternative energy system will be applicable for all other locations in the world with similar meteorological and environmental conditions."
"Computational modelling of strut defects in SLM manufactured lattice structures Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Addition of manufacturing defects to computational models of 3D-printed lattice structures enable improved simulation accuracy. A computational model of a cellular structure based on finite element method (FEM) analysis, often starts from defect-free computer-aided design (CAD) geometries to generate discretised meshes. Such idealised CAD geometries neglect imperfections, which occur during the additive manufacturing process of lattice structures, resulting in model oversimplification. This research aims to incorporate manufacturing defects in the strut elements of a lattice structure, thereby enhancing predictive capabilities of models. In this work, a method of generating CAD AM representative strut models is proposed. The models are generated from micro-computer tomography (Î¼CT) analysis of SLM fabricated struts. The proposed additive manufacturing (AM) representative strut FE model's axial stiffness and critical buckling load is compared to idealised- and Î¼CT- based FE models, with significant error reduction over idealised strut models. The AM representative strut models are then used to generate full lattice FE models and compared with manufactured and idealised FE models. The AM representative FE lattice models show greater correlations toward experiment and more realistic deformation behaviours. Overall, the methodology used in this study demonstrates a novel approach to representing struts in FE models of AM fabricated lattice structures."
"Financial inclusion and poverty: a tale of forty-five thousand households Financial Development; Economic Growth; Trade Openness Using a new nationally representative survey data covering approximately 45,000 Indian households, we examine the effects of financial inclusion on poverty. We construct a multidimensional indicator of financial inclusion and examine the effects of financial inclusion on multiple measures of poverty including the household Poverty Probability Index (PPI), household deprivation scores, and poverty line. We find that financial inclusion has a strong poverty-reducing effect. This finding is consistent across the different measures of poverty used, and alternative ways of measures financial inclusion. These results underpin the importance of financial inclusion and the need for its promotion across countries."
"Identifying high crash risk segments in rural roads using ensemble decision tree-based models Crash Injuries; Crash; Random Parameters Traffic safety forecast models are mainly used to rank road segments. While existing studies have primarily focused on identifying segments in urban networks, rural networks have received less attention. However, rural networks seem to have a higher risk of severe crashes. This paper aims to analyse traffic crashes on rural roads to identify the influencing factors on the crash frequency and present a framework to develop a spatialâ€“temporal crash risk map to prioritise high-risk segments on different days. The crash data of Khorasan Razavi province is used in this study. Crash frequency data with the temporal resolution of one day and spatial resolution of 1500 m from loop detectors are analysed. Four groups of influential factors, including traffic parameters (e.g. traffic flow, speed, time headway), road characteristics (e.g. road type, number of lanes), weather data (e.g. daily rainfall, snow depth, temperature), and calendar variables (e.g. day of the week, public holidays, month, year) are used for model calibration. Three different decision tree algorithms, including, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) have been employed to predict crash frequency. Results show that based on the traditional evaluation measures, the XGBosst is better for the explanation and interpretation of the factors affecting crash frequency, while the RF model is better for detecting trends and forecasting crash frequency. According to the results, the traffic flow rate, road type, year of the crash, and wind speed are the most influencing variables in predicting crash frequency on rural roads. Forecasting the high and medium risk segment-day in the rural network can be essential to the safety management plan. This risk will be sensitive to real traffic data, weather forecasts and road geometric characteristics. Seventy percent of high and medium risk segment-day are predicted for the case study."
"Hormone Therapy and Discrimination in the Labor Market: Emerging Experimental Evidence on the Economics of Endocrinology Premium; Body Height; Aesthetic Value Background: Gender transitioning is increasingly common, but little is known about the extent to which individuals in transition and fully transitioned suffer from wage discrimination. Methods: Managers in the United States (n=204) were shown photos of white and Asian male and female â€œemployeesâ€ at different stages of simulated hormone therapy and were asked to estimate their actual hourly wages based on appearance. Results: The results suggest that Asian men and women â€œin transitionâ€ and fully transitioned do not suffer from significant wage discrimination. However, among the white stimuli, gender atypical (â€œin transitionâ€ and fully transitioned) men and women are estimated to earn significantly less than their gender typical (sexually dimorphic) counterparts, with some gender-specific nuances. Conclusions: The effects of hormone therapy may have a deleterious impact on the wages of white transgender individuals."
"Waste-to-energy ash for treating highly expansive clays in road pavements Waste Incineration; Municipal Solid Waste; Coal Ash Expansive clays are problematic soils as they contain minerals that swell when wetted and shrink during drying. Highway construction on expansive soils requires some form of chemical stabilisation or other treatments to improve pavement performance. Many commercial and waste by-products, such as cement, lime, fly ash and slag, are used as chemical stabilisers to treat expansive clays. Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash is a product obtained from waste-to-energy plants which have attracted increasing attention to prevent land contamination and to reduce landfill costs. This paper investigates the stabilisation mechanism and hydro-mechanical performance of MSWI fly ash-stabilised high plasticity expansive clays. In this study, compressive strength, California bearing ratio (CBR), dynamic cone penetration, shrinkage and swelling, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) tests were conducted to understand the performance of MSWI fly ash for the treatment of high-plasticity expansive clay. The study found that MSWI fly ash reduces swelling potential and increases the ten-day soaked CBR to about 80%. Microlevel analysis showed that hydration reaction, cationic exchange, flocculation, and agglomeration between clay sheets are the key phases in MSWI fly ash stabilisation. In addition, the porosity of the clay reduced from 3.43% to 0.18% after stabilisation with 20% MSWI fly ash. The outcomes from the study provide guidance on using MSWI ash for improving problematic soils while enabling an efficient way to manage municipal solid wastes."
"Corrosion resistance of in-situ growth of nano-sized Mg(OH) 2 on micro-arc oxidized magnesium alloy AZ31—Influence of EDTA Magnesium Alloys; Biodegradable Implant; Corrosion One of the major obstacles for the clinical use of biodegradable magnesium (Mg)-based materials is their high corrosion rate. Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) coatings on Mg alloys provide mild corrosion protection owing to their porous structure. Hence, in this study a dense Mg(OH) 2 film was fabricated on MAO-coated Mg alloy AZ31 in an alkaline electrolyte containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium (EDTA-2Na) to reinforce the protection. Surface morphology, chemical composition and growth process of the MAO/Mg(OH) 2 hybrid coating were examined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer. Corrosion resistance of the coatings was evaluated via potentiodynamic polarization curves and hydrogen evolution tests. Results manifested that the Mg(OH) 2 coating possesses a porous nano-sized structure and completely seals the micro-pores and micro-cracks of the MAO coating. The intermetallic compound of AlMn phase in the substrate plays a key role in the growth of Mg(OH) 2 film. The current density of Mg(OH) 2 -MAO composite coating decreases three orders of magnitude in comparison with that of bare substrate, indicating excellent corrosion resistance. The Mg(OH) 2 -MAO composite coating is beneficial to the formation of calcium phosphate corrosion products on the surface of Mg alloy AZ31, demonstrating a great promise for orthopaedic applications."
"Trace element concentrations in feathers of seven petrels (Pterodroma spp.) Feathers; Birds; Grus Japonensis Gadfly petrels (Pterodroma spp.) are one of the most threatened and poorly studied seabird groups, and as marine predators, are exposed to biomagnified and bioaccumulated chemical pollutants from their prey. We quantified trace element concentrations in breast feathers of seven petrel species that breed in the southern hemisphere to quantify current concentrations. Selenium (Se) concentrations were significantly lower in chicks than adults; this was not observed for zinc (Zn) or lead (Pb). Overall, the species examined here exhibited similar concentrations of Se, with Pb and Zn concentrations more variable among species. The mean Se concentration in adult birds exceeded those thought to be potentially deleterious, and three species had concentrations that were above the assumed threshold for Pb toxicity. Further investigation of potentially toxic trace elements in gadfly petrels is warranted."
"Heatwaves, cooling and young children at home: Integrating energy and health objectives Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort This paper examines the practices advised by health authorities and performed by parents to cool infants during hot weather. The aim is to explore how health and energy efficiency imperatives can be better integrated for households. Consumption of home air conditioning is increasing around the world alongside policy concerns about energy poverty, climate change and peak demand. This paper analyses online sources containing advice to parents about temperature, hot weather and infant health. The content of this â€˜know-whatâ€™ for parents was considered alongside experience-based â€˜know-howâ€™ (Royston, 2014) as described by parents in 44 interviews and home tours in Australia. Air conditioning is frequently positioned by health authorities as superior to low or no energy practices. However, understandings of infant care during hot weather are diverse and unsettled âˆ’ both amongst parents and authorities. The absence of health sector consensus leaves space for energy policymakers to engage with the health sector to develop integrated cross-sectoral policy approaches. Continued circulation of adaptive, less energy-intensive hot weather practices is needed. Arresting the trajectory towards widespread reliance on air conditioning can help household finances, reduce electricity demand during hot weather, and avoid leaving parents ill-equipped when high demand or unexpected events compromise electricity supply."
"A multicriteria analysis approach for evaluating the performance of agriculture decision support systems for sustainable agribusiness Farmers Knowledge; Decision Support Systems; Decision Making Agriculture decision support systems (DSSs) play an important role in facilitating evidenceâ€based agricultural decisionâ€making for improving agribusiness productivity. Evaluating and selecting the most appropriate agriculture DSS for sustainable agribusiness is, however, challenging due to the existence of production and marketing alternatives, a variety of objective functions from economic to lifestyle to longâ€term sustainability, and the subjectiveness and imprecision involved in the evaluation process. To help decision makers effectively deal with these issues, this paper presents a multicriteria analysis approach for evaluating and selecting the most appropriate agriculture DSS for sustainable agribusiness. The subjective assessments of decision makers in the evaluation process are formulated using linguistic variables approximated by fuzzy numbers. The concept based on the positive and the negative ideal solutions is applied for producing a performance index value for every agriculture DSS alternative across all evaluation criteria based on which the most appropriate agriculture DSS is. An empirical study is presented for demonstrating the stepâ€wise process for evaluating and selecting the most appropriate agriculture DSS for sustainable agribusiness. The outcome from the performance evaluation process allows agribusinesses to effectively adopt appropriate agriculture DSSs for achieving competitive advantages."
"Perception of wind in open spaces Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Microclimate Dense urbanization influences the livability of cities. Changes in local meteorological conditions can be adverse for human health and well-being. In urban open spaces, it is widely known that changes in building density and configuration in cities influence wind speed (Va). This influence modifies latent heat flux between the human body and surrounding environment and thereby affecting the thermal comfort conditions in open spaces between buildings. Several studies have demonstrated the significant effect of wind speed on outdoor thermal comfort. Melbourne's Central Business District (CBD) has recently experienced dense urbanization and this pattern of development has instigated noticeable changes in meteorological conditions. Some evidence has suggested that the patterns of wind flow induce thermal discomfort during cool seasons. Conversely, the wind is most welcomed during warm seasons. This study was conducted to assess outdoor users' responses to Va in three open spaces of an educational precinct in Melbourne's CBD. The open spaces studied are different in terms of design and function. Users' responses and meteorological conditions were examined through a series of field measurements and questionnaire surveys from November 2014 to May 2015. This study used three perceptual scales to analyze participants' experience of Va during field surveys: ""Bedford preference"", ""thermal sensation"" and ""personal acceptability"". Analytical results yielded the wind perceptual comfort thresholds for different seasons as well as the entire study period. The results suggested that in addition to the geometry of the urban open space, the function of place could influence people's perceptions of Va. The research findings contribute to developing thermally comfortable outdoor environments."
"Shell buckling: From morphogenesis of soft matter to prospective applications Wrinkle; Buckling; Thin Films Being one of the commonest deformation modes for soft matter, shell buckling is the primary reason for the growth and nastic movement of many plants, as well as the formation of complex natural morphology. On-demand regulation of buckling-induced deformation associated with wrinkling, ruffling, folding, creasing and delaminating has profound implications for diverse scopes, which can be seen in its broad applications in microfabrication, 4D printing, actuator and drug delivery. This paper reviews the recent remarkable developments in the shell buckling of soft matter to explain the most representative natural morphogenesis from the perspectives of theoretical analysis in continuum mechanics, finite element analysis, and experimental validations. Imitation of buckling-induced shape transformation and its applications are also discussed for the innovations of sophisticated materials and devices in future."
"Managing bullying in the workplace: a model of servant leadership, employee resilience and proactive personality Mobbing; Incivility; Nurses Purpose: This paper develops and tests a model for managing workplace bullying by integrating employee perceived servant leadership, resilience and proactive personality. Specifically, this paper explores servant leadership as an inhibitive factor for workplace bullying, both directly and indirectly in the presence of employee resilience as a mediator. It further explores whether proactive personality moderates the indirect relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This is an empirical study based on analysis of survey data collected from 408 employees working in services and manufacturing sector organisations in Pakistan. Structural equation modelling was used to test the research model. Findings: Structural equation modelling results support the proposition that servant leadership helps in discouraging workplace bullying, both directly and indirectly, in the presence of employee resilience as a mediator. However, employee proactive personality moderates this process, such that the association between resilience and workplace bullying is stronger for individuals with high proactive personality. Research limitations/implications: This study's findings illuminate the strong potential of servant leadership for managing workplace bullying. This potential is attributed to positive role modelling in the workplace, which may assist in building followers' resilience. This study provides evidence to support the importance of leadership in the process by which employees develop better psychological resources to combat bullying at work. Originality/value: This is the first study that examines the direct relationship between servant leadership and bullying at work. In addition, this study introduced the mediating effect of resilience and the moderating effect of proactive personality on this relationship."
"The Role of Biochar in Sustainable Agriculture, and Climate Change Mitigation for Sustainable Cities Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Sustainable development is facing a transformation. One solution finding its place as a key strategy in a number of sustainable development goal areas is biochar. Biochar is a geo-engineered bi-product that is similar in appearance to charcoal which differs from charcoal in that the organic biomass waste from which it is created is heated in an enclosed chamber to low temperatures and deprived of oxygen. This paper investigates the latest studies in crop productivity, commercial viabilities, and the socio-economic options of biochar production at a local and international level in the pursuit of sustainability and climate change mitigation. In terms of sustainability the uptake of biochar as a model for sustainable agriculture is steadily gaining momentum due to its agronomic potential for crop yields, organic soil carbon, carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The economic viability of biochar production varies markedly around the world. The most promising opportunities for soil carbon sequestration have derived from voluntary carbon markets and government initiatives such as Australiaâ€™s Emissions Reduction Fund. The scheme promoted the integration of biochar in land use management practices at a farm scale. If biochar is to have a more profound impact on a global scale, then countries need to adopt a sustainable biochar strategy which is universal along with standardised sustainability protocols."
"Chromated copper arsenate timber: A review of products, leachate studies and recycling Copper; Wood Preservatives; Brown-rot Fungi Large volumes of chromated copper arsenate (CCA)-treated wood are disposed of in lined and un-lined landfills across the world. Studies regarding the disposal and reuse of CCA-treated timber date back to the 1980s. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the research undertaken regarding reconstituted chromated copper arsenate-treated timber products, and considers the relevant health issues and disposal techniques, such as incineration and thermochemical conversion, as well as long-term solutions for the managing of chromated copper arsenate-treated-waste wood. The results from reviewing the literature regarding reconstituted timber products consisting of CC-treated timber such as particle board, cement-bonded particle board, flake board, remediated wood composites, wood-plastic composites, and wood-cement composites revealed that products such as particle board, wood-plastic composites and flake board composed of CCA-treated timber show considerable promise. Further research is required to determine the optimum percentage of CCA-treated timber in wood-plastic composites to minimize leaching while attaining suitable physical and mechanical performance, and to evaluate the durability of reconstituted chromated copper arsenate timber products via severe accelerated aging tests. Several CCA-waste wood disposal methods were investigated in the form of extraction and destruction techniques including thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis, gasification), incineration, co-incineration and combustion. Such management techniques demonstrate promising, feasible, future solutions providing the ability to trap arsenic gas, recover metals, and create secondary energy forms. However, more research is required, especially regarding resultant arsenic compounds and their volatile behaviours. Industries that create and sell chromated copper arsenate-treated wood products are encouraged to follow the United States Environmental Protection Agency leachate testing procedures (Methods 1314 and 1315, published in 2013), since these methods are more accurate at evaluating the leaching behaviour during their lifetime, and various disposal scenarios that reflect differing pH values and liquid to solid ratios."
"The gendered nature of the risk factors of the COVID-19 pandemic and gender equality: A literature review from a vulnerability perspective Reproductive Health; Abortion; COVID-19 The risk factors of COVID-19 are not gender-neutral but gendered. A vulnerability approach to pandemics suggests that females are more prone to risk exposure while there are inequalities in accessing resources and opportunities. These inequalities create a gendered pandemic vul-nerability. The current article addresses the specific vulnerability on the gendered risk factors en-countered by girls and women due to the gendered pandemic in a global context and their impacts on gender inequality. This study analyses the existing literature on the gendered pandemic and risk factors on females that lead to gender inequality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study adopts a vulnerability approach to the pandemic as an analytical concept. Our findings from the systematic literature review suggest that womenâ€™s pre-existing vulnerabilities are exacerbated in the wake of the pandemic due to the gendered risk factors worsening the gender equality gap. We con-clude by arguing that our studyâ€™s finding supports a vulnerability approach to disasters."
"The effect of high performance work system strength on organizational effectiveness: Opportunities for international joint ventures by foreign firms High Performance Work Systems; Personnel; HR Practice Purpose: This paper aims to examine the implications of high performance work system (HPWS) strength from a managerial perspective and the impact of economic, cultural, political, legal and technological factors on the operationalization of HPWSs in the banking industry in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach: The data for this study were collected from three licensed commercial banks in Sri Lanka. This research used a case study approach for data collection with archival analysis of records and semi-structured interviews with the CEO, head of HR, two board members and three focus groups (top, middle and lower level managers across various functional areas) in each bank which altogether covers 66 key informants. Findings: The findings supported the research proposition that to gain positive outcomes on organizational effectiveness, there should be a strong HPWS, resulting in a positive attitudinal climate among employees. Further, the findings provide evidence of the global applicability of HPWSs, although more research is needed to clearly specify the contextual boundaries of HPWS effectiveness. Originality/value: Contemporary research provides ample evidence to endorse the contribution of high performance work systems toward organizational effectiveness. However, there is a dearth of literature on how high performance work systems are operationalized across the management hierarchy and support the achievement of organizational effectiveness. Few studies have been conducted on high performance work system strength and organizational effectiveness in emerging economies."
"Estimating unit cost of public university education in Vietnam Firm; Bribes; Anti-corruption Measures This paper is motivated by the ongoing debate on university reform in Vietnam. In particular, there is a need to quantify the level of governmental support for public universities and examine whether or not such a support is adequate. To this end, the present paper estimates training costs per student in different disciplines within the Vietnamese public university education system in 2010. The various estimates of unit costs are based on the definitional approach which defines unit cost as the ratio of total costs over output. In measuring total costs, private costs incurred by university students (apart from formal tuition fees) are excluded. Further, the opportunity cost method employed emphasizes implicit costs such as imputed land rent. The total output is based on weighted student numbers. Unit costs are then estimated using a variety of primary (from survey) and secondary data sources. The results obtained suggest that the unit costs of public university education in Vietnam vary considerably between disciplines. The results also support the presence of economies of scale and scope in higher education and a negative relationship between unit costs and teaching quality proxies. The overall unit cost of public universities in Vietnam is very low in absolute terms when comparing with other countries. However, unit cost relative to GDP per capita in Vietnam is more comparable with those of neighboring countries. Nevertheless, the findings of the paper imply that more resources need to be allocated to the public university sector as part of an urgently needed university reform in Vietnam."
"The evolution of a micro-credential Mathematics; Numeracy; Bank Employees In 2017, key representatives from the University microcredentials team and the Library collaborated to develop, deliver and embed into curriculum, digital literacy micro-credentials in multiple course shells via the Universityâ€™s new learning management system. The first microcredential delivered was Information Literacy. This credential aimed to address student needs to recognise when information was needed and strengthen their ability to locate, evaluate, and use information effectively (ALA Clearing House, 2017). Students who earned the microcredential were rewarded with a digital badge that outlined the achieved learning outcomes and recognition of this award was reflected on their official academic transcript. In addition, the badges were shared on social media platforms like LinkedIn as a way to demonstrate new skills and engage prospective employers. In 2019, the original credential was reviewed to ensure relevancy. A subsequent eight-week sprint process was initiated. The review process sought feedback from various stakeholders that included the RMIT Creds team learning designer, the subject matter experts (SMEs) from the Library and student reviewers. Results from the review process for the Information Literacy credential highlighted key changes to content and learning outcomes to reduce confusion for students and ensure learning outcomes addressed the module content directly. In addition, a shift away from a traditional educational context of information literacy to a broader professional context was also recommended to ensure relevancy to industry."
"Child protection and family group conferencing curriculum for social workers in Palestine First International; Indigenization; Family Preservation This article describes a United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund project to develop a child protection curriculum in social work schools in Palestine conducted over 2016, 2017 and 2018. The curriculum was delivered in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as to a delegation from Palestine in Melbourne. The article discusses the challenges and highlights in introducing a rights and strength-based, child-focused, family-inclusive, and trauma-informed child protection curriculum in the context of occupation, poverty and patriarchy. It emphasises the need for critical reflection for foreign educators in relation to culture, gender, human rights and anti-oppressive practices when teaching in the Middle East and other collective cultures. The key outcomes were new collaborations between Palestinian academics from Gaza and the West Bank, as well as their preference for family group conferencing over traditional Western case management models of child protection to promote peaceful, inclusive societies."
"The Effect of Geometry on Local Processing State in Additively Manufactured Ti-6Al-4V Lattices Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Laser-based powder bed fusion is a thermal metal additive manufacturing process suitable for the fabrication of complex structures. Laser-based powder bed fusion induces large localized thermal gradients and cooling rates, which can produce significant variation in mechanical properties by affecting the underlying microstructure and porosity. This research describes how thermal imaging data can be analyzed to establish correlations for geometric factors such as strut diameter, inclination angle, and lattice location with thermal field variables. This research develops a methodology to analyze full-field temporal and spatial data across entire printed objects and systematically classify those data based on local and far-field geometry characteristics. This methodology is applied to generate an experimental timeâ€“temperature dataset for: (1) evaluation of the interactions of specific local geometric features and the local processing characteristics, (2) evaluation and calibration of proposed thermal models and (3) providing a methodology to validate other qualitative but higher spatial and temporal resolution in-process monitoring approaches."
"Top economics universities and research institutions in Vietnam: evidence from the SSHPA dataset Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science Economic research is vital for creating more suitable policies to facilitate economic growth. Employing a combination of descriptive and Bayesian analyses, this paper investigates the research landscape of the economics discipline in Vietnam, in particular, the leading affiliations in the field and how these institutions compare to each other in terms of productivity, the number of lead authors, new authors and publications' journal impact factor. We also examine the differences in the authors' productivity based on their age and gender. The dataset extracted from the SSHPA database includes 1,444 articles. The findings show that among top producers of economic research in Vietnam, seven are universities, leaving only one representative of research institutes. These top producers account for 52% of research output among 178 institutes recorded in the database. We also find a correlation between a researcher's affiliation, sex, and scientific productivity in Vietnam's economic discipline. Overall, publications by male researchers outnumber those by female ones in most of the top affiliations. The findings also indicate that 40â€“44 is the age group with the highest scientific productivity. Researchers' collaboration, which is observed through co-authorship, is on the rise in all of the top eight economic research affiliations. However, the quality of current Vietnam's scientific works in the discipline is questionable. Therefore, it is suggested that in order to sustain scientific productivity, economic researchers might need to balance the quantity and quality of their contributions.Scientific collaboration; scientific publishing; economics discipline; Vietnam; Bayesian analysis."

"Bodies of/at Work: How Women of Colour Experienced Their Workplaces and Have Been Expected to ‘Perform’ During the COVID-19 Pandemic Intersectionality; Feminism; Social Location Almost 50 years ago, Edward Said wrote on â€˜the otherâ€™ in relation to race and gender in his path-breaking book Orientalism (1978). While much has evolved around notions of gendered and racialised otherness since then, Saidâ€™s conceptualisation still resonates today. Our paper reports on a 2020/2021 survey of Women of Colour in the Australian workplace. The survey was conducted during the pandemic by Women of Colour Australia, a not-for-profit group, working with the lead author. We focus on the qualitative answers from participants, many of which detail sometimes painful and extremely personal workplace experiences. More than 500 Women of Colour, including seven per cent who were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, completed the survey. Sixty per cent said they had experienced discrimination in the workplace, despite 59 per cent of participants saying their workplace had a Diversity and Inclusion policy. Participants had to â€˜performâ€™ their identities whilst being subjected to intersectional issues of racism and sexism, some of which the pandemic exacerbated. Our paper describes the harmful ramifications of gendered othering of Women of Colour for Australian organisations and society in the years of the pandemic."
"Recycling steel slag from municipal wastewater treatment plants into concrete applications – A step towards circular economy Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption Municipal wastewater is a major source of the release of phosphorus into the marine environment, and its excessive release could negatively impact marine flora and fauna. In this study, steel slag a by-product from steel industry was used to remove phosphorus content from the municipal wastewater. The Langmuir isotherm model revealed a maximum adsorption capacity of 3.8 mg phosphate/g of steelmaking slag. The results showed that the phosphate removal efficiency of granular slag was about 90%. The wastewater contained a significant amount of iron and manganese content that was filtered out by the slag granules. X-ray fluorescence and x-ray diffraction analysis show that the wastewater treatment process changes the chemical phase composition of slag in addition to the absorption/adsorption of various chemicals within its pore structure. To recycle this waste slag after the water treatment process, that significantly altered its chemical and mineralogical composition, it was used in concrete as a replacement of conventional coarse aggregates. The results show that the treated slag aggregates provide compressive strength improvement of 32.5% and 18% at 7 days and 8.2 and 16.8% improvement at 28 days compared to that of raw slag and conventional aggregates, respectively. In addition, due to the pozzolanic nature of slag both the raw and treated slag aggregates showed a seamless monolithic bond at the interfacial transition zone between the slag and the cement matrix. This study demonstrates that the waste slag generated from the wastewater treatment process has a great potential to be used as a replacement of conventional aggregates in concrete applications."
"Trends in bioaccumulation and metabolite profiles in Mediterranean mussels with sub lethal exposure to mixtures of trace metals Zinc Transporter; Znaf-2; Neuron Trace metals are major environmental contaminants, and the accumulation of trace metals could cause changes to the metabolism of marine organisms. In order to understand trends in bioaccumulation and changes in metabolic pathways in marine mussels during short-term and long-term exposure to trace metal mixtures, wild Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were exposed to natural seawater spiked with two sub lethal concentrations of a mixture of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and lead (Pb) for 30 days. Mussels were collected every 5 days and trace metal levels in the whole bodies were measured. The gills of mussels collected on day 5 and day 30 were sampled separately. Trace metal levels in whole bodies of these samples were measured and metabolites in the gill tissue extracted, profiled, identified, and compared between groups with different exposure time and trace metal levels. The results showed continuous increase in body burdens of Cu and Pb in mussels throughout the exposure period, while Zn accumulation reached a plateau after day 10 in the whole body and gills. The metabolomics analysis demonstrated that multiple metabolites were down-regulated and multiple metabolic pathways possibly interrupted by exposure to the mixture of trace metals. This study provides extensive knowledge that the effects of Cu, Zn, and Pb exposure on the metabolic pathways have the potential to result in reduced fitness of Mediterranean mussels and demonstrates potential of GC-MS based untargeted metabolomics to be used as a part of trace metal pollution evaluation and ecosystem health monitoring."
"Trustworthy maps Spatial Data; Crowdsourcing; Global Positioning System Maps get used for decision making about the world's most pressing problems (e.g., climate change, refugee crises, biodiversity loss, rising inequality, pandemic disease). Although maps have historically been a trusted source of information, changes in society (e.g., lower levels of trust in decision makers) and in mapmaking technologies and practices (e.g., anyone can now make their own maps) mean that we need to spend some time thinking about how, when, and why people trust maps and mapmaking processes. This is critically important if we want stakeholders to engage constructively with the information we present in maps, because they are unlikely to do so if they do not trust what they see. Here I outline three questions about trust and maps that I think need research attention. First, how can we focus map readers' attention on the trustworthiness of mapped data, especially if trustworthiness changes as in the case of real-time data sources? Second, does presenting uncertainty information on maps affect the level of trust map readers have in the map, and if so, does trust vary depending on how the uncertainty information is presented? Finally, how does virality affect trust? Are viral maps less trusted? The time and resources required to develop a better understanding of how trust in maps might be changing will be repaid. The world needs good information to guide policy- and decision-making. Well designed maps can help stakeholders to work together to solve problems, but only if they are trusted."
"A review of dry sanitation systems Sludge Treatment; Toilet Facilities; Sewage Dry sanitation systems (waterless or composting toilets) have been used since the 1970s. Their use has received acceptance in rural regions of Europe and the United States. Some of the advantages of dry sanitation systems include their waterless nature, their low energy requirement and the creation of fertilizer as an added value product. Moreover, the use of such a system is a sustainable sanitation approach that may reduce the burden on infrastructure and provide sanitation to the 2.5 billion people worldwide who do not currently have access to it. The critical factors when choosing a dry sanitation system and their optimum parameters include aeration, moisture content (50%â€“60%), temperature (40â€“65â—¦C), carbon to nitrogen ratio (25â€“35), pH (5.5â€“8.0) and porosity (35%â€“50%). The temperatureâ€“time criterion approach is the most common method used to evaluate the stability and safety of the compost as a fertilizer. The risks of handling the waste after 12 months of composting have been calculated as low. Here, we have reviewed and assessed the features of dry sanitation systems currently available, focusing on those designed for and operated in remote areas such as national parks and tourist destinations and, more importantly, in rural areas in developing countries or refugee shelters where water/sanitation may be scarce."
"Influence of soil moisture regimes on growth, photosynthetic capacity, leaf biochemistry and reproductive capabilities of the invasive agronomic weed; Lactuca serriola Plant Leaves; Stomatal Conductance; Photosynthesis Global temperatures are predicted to increase by 1.5â€“5.9C during this century, and this change is likely to impact average rainfall, with predictions that water deficit will perhaps be the most severe threat to sustainable agriculture. In this respect, invasive weeds, which have traits better adapted to drought stress than crops, add to concerns regarding crop sustainability. Lactuca serriola, an aggressive agronomic weed is thought to be a successful weed because of its ability to maintain high water use efficiency under drought conditions. In this study, experiments were conducted to examine the influence of different soil moisture regimes (100%, 75%, 50% and 25% water holding capacity (WHC)) on growth, photosynthetic capacity, leaf biochemistry and reproduction of this species. Soil moisture significantly affected plantâ€™s height, stem diameter, number of leaves and biomass. The highest plant height (115.14 cm Â± 11.64), shoot diameter (9.4 mm Â± 0.18), leaf area (1206.5 mm2 Â± 73.29), plant fresh weight (83.1 Â± 3.98) and dry weight (22.38 Â± 1.24) were recorded at 75% soil moisture content. A fundamental adaptation to drought was observed as plants in the 25% WHC treatment had the highest root: shoot ratio. Soluble sugars and total phenolic content were highest in the 25% WHC treatment and significantly different to 100% WHC which was a response to soil moisture stress to ameliorate the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species produced under stress conditions. Results also indicate that L. serriola can survive and produce seeds under water stress as more than 6000 seeds were produced per plant in all WHC treatments. In this study, there was no significant difference in the seed weight, number of seeds produced and their germination ability. This can have a huge impact on agricultural systems as the species can survive both under low and high soil moisture conditions. We therefore suggest that the demonstrated ability of L. serriola to complete its life cycle and produce biomass and seeds under water stressed conditions leads to the introduction of strategies that minimize weed survival while maximizing irrigation efficiency for the crop. A clear understanding of the ecological and biological characteristics of this weed will help land managers take appropriate control measures to mitigate the effect of this species on economic crop productivity."
"Contamination of groundwater with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from legacy landfills in an urban re-development precinct Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane The extent of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in groundwater surrounding legacy landfills is currently poorly constrained. Seventeen PFAS were analysed in groundwater surrounding legacy landfills in a major Australian urban re-development precinct. Sampling locations (n = 13) included sites installed directly in waste material and down-gradient from landfills, some of which exhibited evidence of leachate contamination including elevated concentrations of ammonia-N (â‰¤106 mg/L), bicarbonate (â‰¤1,740 mg/L) and dissolved methane (â‰¤10.4 mg/L). Between one and fourteen PFAS were detected at all sites and PFOS, PFHxS, PFOA and PFBS were detected in all samples. The sum of detected PFAS (âˆ‘14PFAS) varied from 26 ng/L at an ambient background site to 5,200 ng/L near a potential industrial point-source. PFHxS had the highest median concentration (34 ng/L; range: 2.6â€“280 ng/L) followed by PFOS (26 ng/L; range: 1.3â€“4,800 ng/L), PFHxA (19 ng/L; range: <LOQ â€“ 46 ng/L) and PFOA (12 ng/L; range: 1.7â€“74 ng/L). Positive correlations between âˆ‘14PFAS, PFOA and other perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) (e.g. PFHxA) with typical leachate indicators including ammonia-N and bicarbonate were observed. In contrast, no such correlations were found with perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) (e.g., PFOS and PFHxS). In addition, a strong positive linear correlation (R2 = 0.69) was found between the proportion of PFOA in the sum of detected perfluorinated alkylated acids (PFOA/âˆ‘PFAA) and ammonia-N concentrations in groundwater. This is consistent with previous research showing relatively high PFOA/âˆ‘PFAA in municipal landfill leachates, and more conservative behaviour (e.g. less sorption and reactivity) of PFCAs during subsurface transport compared to PFSAs. PFOA/âˆ‘PFAA in groundwater may therefore be a useful indicator of municipal landfill-derived PFAA. One site with significantly elevated PFOS and PFHxS concentrations (4,800 and 280 ng/L, respectively) appears to be affected by point-source industrial contamination, as landfill leachate indicators were absent. PFAS have been analysed in groundwater surrounding legacy landfills in a major urban re-development precinct in Australia, to better understand their sources, fate and transport."
"Factors affecting the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices: Findings from panel data for Vietnam Agriculture; Indo-Gangetic Plain; Tillage Conventional farming and climate change are placing considerable stress on agricultural systems around the world, leading to increased hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, particularly in developing countries. Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) can help raise productivity and agricultural incomes while minimising negative environmental impacts. While recognising that sustainability is a contested term, we identify agricultural practices that are generally viewed as sustainable as they minimise impacts on the environment. Despite the benefits of SAPs, adoption rates are still low in developing countries. While previous studies have examined the factors affecting SAP adoption, most have not accounted for issues of heterogeneity and endogeneity inherent in such analysis. In this paper, we address this by employing a random-effects probit model with the Mundlak approach and fixed-effects linear probability models to control for farmer- and plot-level heterogeneities and to avoid the incidental parameters problem. We analyse panel data from Vietnam for approximately 14,000 plots over the period 2008â€“2016 to identify the factors behind SAP adoption. Overall, we find that improved knowledge transferred by extension agents and learning from peers significantly influence adoption. Farmers' knowledge of their land and soil quality are also important factors. We recommend enhancing cooperation between extension agents, farmer groups and peers in order to encourage SAP adoption."
"A techno-economic case for volatile fatty acid production for increased sustainability in the wastewater treatment industry Activated Sludge; Anaerobic Digestion; Pretreatment Methane, the final product of methanogenesis during anaerobic digestion is a low value product (0.1 $ per m3). Concerns over fugitive emissions from methane coupled with recent reduction in costs of solar and wind energy raise questions over the long-term sustainability of the anaerobic digestion process as a technology to produce renewable energy. The production of short chain volatile fatty acids (VFAs), a by-product of acetogenesis, represents a high value product. The projected VFA market demand for 2020 is 18 500 kilotons, increasing at an annual rate of 3% per year. Here, we review the business case for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to produce VFAs instead of biogas. Techno-economic and sensitivity studies are conducted to understand and compare economic feasibilities. Under favourable conditions, with positive government incentives, future WWTPs could produce high purity (>98%) propionic acid at 3.8 $ per kg, 35% less than the commercial selling value (6 $ per kg)."
"Discursive constructions of consumer choice, performance measurement and the marketisation of disability services and aged care in Australia Social Support; Social Care; Direct Payments We show how policy discourses construct consumer choice, performance measurement and quality standards as key technologies in the marketisation of disability services and aged care in Australia. The emergence of performance outcome measurement and increased consumer access to these through diverse consumer facing and interactive platforms enables the state to â€œgovern at a distanceâ€ through the management and shaping of outcome indicators rather than delivery of services. The state does this by creating market competition and establishing outcomes which reflect the construction people using services as informed and rational consumers rather than citizens. This construction and operationalisation frame marketisation as a rational solution to broken systems, assume choice is unproblematic and ignore diverse capacities to access and use information, resource differentials and contextual variables such as market maturity and service availability. The benign marketisation of human services thus discriminates against those who are already marginalised and disadvantaged unless equity strategies are clearly in place."
"Effect of Crystallization State on the Gel Properties of Oleogels Based on β-sitosterol Emulsion; Monoacylglycerols; Candelilla Wax Oleogels based on three different oils (sunflower oil, solid coconut oil and liquid coconut oil) were formulated using Î²-sitosterol. In general, an observed increase in crystallinity was correlated with an increase in the gel storage modulus and hardness. Addition of lecithin promoted the formation of needle-like crystals of Î²-sitosterol with a corresponding increase in strain tolerance and oil-trapping capacity for oleogels produced with liquid oils. However, the incorporation of Î²-sitosterol crystals with or without lecithin into oleogels containing solid coconut oil reduced its strain tolerance by interrupting the formation of continual radiolitic crystal structures. The use of sunflower oil (long chain fatty acids) was more favourable to the packing and growth of gelator crystals and the formation of an elastic gel, in comparison to liquid coconut oil (short chain fatty acids). Overall, the type and physical state of oil influence the formation of oil crystal network, thus affecting its gel properties. These findings allow the better understanding of Î²-sitosterol-based oleogels, providing opportunity to design for the application as a fat-replacer and lowering solid fat content."
"Cyber Attacks Detection from Smart City Applications Using Artificial Neural Network Intrusion Detection System; Network Security; Denial-Of-Service Attack Recently, the widespread deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications has contributed to the development of smart cities, which utilise smart applications to maximize operational efficiency, and thereby the quality of services and the wellbeing of people. In this paper, we propose an attack and anomaly detection technique based on machine learning algorithms to mitigate IoT cybersecurity threats in a smart city. Notably, while there are many different machine learning (ML) algorithms, including computationally expensive deep learning network, we opted for using artificial neural network (ANN) since an ANN can provide a simple and computationally faster architecture as needed for smart city operations. A widely used performance metrics, namely, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are utilized to evaluate the model. Experiment results with the recent attack dataset demonstrate that the proposed technique can effectively identify the cyber attacks and outperform results reported in an existing work."
"Skilled migrant workplace integration: the choice between pragmatism and critical realism approaches Labour Market Integration; Emigrants and Immigrants; Earnings Gap This article provides a rationale for adopting the critical realism (CR) instead of pragmatism paradigm when researching skilled migrants' (SMs) workplace integration in Australia. While the extant SM literature has provided an abundance of â€˜explanations' reflecting the difficulties SMs face, it appears almost impossible for SMs to overcome some challenges such as discrimination or lack of local work experience. However, there is not a sufficient explanation for why many SMs have successfully integrated within the host labour market despite facing such difficulties. This study was designed to challenge what may have been â€˜taken-for-granted' in the literature and explore the causal relationship behind the SMsâ€™ difficulties and success. The CR paradigm provides a new way to examine the problems SMs face and their strategies to overcome such issues. It also empowers researchers to look beyond the empirical layer of evidence and explore how and why things happen the way they do."
"Challenges and opportunities of the fourth revolution: a brief insight into the future of food Fog Computing; Network Protocol; Internet of Things By 2050, the global population is projected to be in excess of nine billion people. This will result in an increased burden and stress on the food production systems, particularly in adjustments to several stages of the value chain that will require improvements and/or modifications in their effectiveness such as reducing waste, adapting to climate change, food security, and health. Disruptions such as digital agriculture, digital food, food agility, big data, have been utilized to characterize the changes in the way agro-food systems evolve and function, as well as in the approach they have been analyzed, measured, and monitored. It has been long recognized that the food industry is considered as a data driven enterprise. These characteristics are very important as the food industry becomes global and sustainable. The food industry is currently undergoing significant changes, and with this, challenges are occurring. These challenges are brought about from the food chains, climate changes, and the ability to be resilient in the production of food. Furthermore, health and cultural changes to food are occurring, where the diseases of obesity, diabetes, and aging in the population will continue to change the consumerâ€™s patterns and choices; whereby the consumer will be persuaded to choose and eat healthy and more nutritious foods. Indeed, the cultural awareness and social innovation to prevent food waste and therefore improve food security and sustainability will also prove to further complexities. This short review will briefly discuss some of the forefront issues in food value chains with a focus on using technology."
"Elite sport hubs during COVID-19: The job demands and resources that exist for athletes Sports; Football; Athletes In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, elite sport leagues implemented hubs, or 'bubbles', which restricted athletes' movements and social interactions in order to minimise the risk of athlete infection and allow competitions to continue. This was a new way of working and living for elite athletes and there was a dearth of literature on this topic. The main objective of the study was to investigate the impacts of the hub model on athletes over time, and what job demands and resources existed for athletes through the application of Demerouti et al. (2001) Job Demands-Resources Model. Multiple sequential semi-structured interviews were conducted with Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) athletes during the 2020 season, which was held entirely in a hub in North Queensland, Australia. The key job demands in an elite sport hub identified were the volume of work, simultaneous overload and underload, and nature of work in the hub. The key resources that emerged include recovery services, control and player agency, and constructive social relations. Despite the presence of job resources, which work to counteract, or buffer job demands in order to reduce work stress and improve motivation, they were found to be insufficient for athletes and inequitably distributed between clubs. The intensity of the hub model also amplified demands present in all WNBL seasons. This research is therefore useful for planning of future elite sport leagues to improve the type and amount of resources available to athletes, thereby improving athlete wellbeing and performance both within and outside a hub model."
"The professionalization tension in women’s sport: the case of women’s basketball in Australia Football; Masculinity; Sports Research Question: Women athletes in elite leagues are increasingly viewed as professional, but often this label is aspirational and does not reflect their experience. They are rarely provided with professional working conditions, which creates barriers to becoming elite, full-time athletes. This research aimed to explore the barriers faced by Australian women basketballers at the elite and sub-elite level, how those barriers vary at each stage on the professionalization continuum, and how this impacted the athleteâ€™s experience. Research methods: Concept Mapping is a two-phased mixed-methods technique that was used to explore the barriers faced by elite and sub-elite women basketballers. Participants in both groups separately brainstormed barriers they faced, sorted them into groups based on similarity of meaning, and rated them for importance and frequency. Results and findings: For sub-elite players, barriers resulting from the inability to balance sporting commitment with other facets of their lives were rated the most important and most frequently experienced. For elite players, the main barrier was low pay. Both these types of barriers link to the respective stage of professionalization of their leagues. Cluster maps and go-zones for each group represent the data. Implications: By placing the results in the context of Bowes and Culvinâ€™s (2021) definition of professionalization, this research adds to the understanding of how the current stage of professionalization in Australian womenâ€™s basketball hinders career progression for these athletes, and diminishes their experience as a player."
"Who Goes to Metropolitan Parks? A Latent Class Analysis Approach to Understanding Park Visitation Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians This study aimed to identify typologies of park visitors and to examine associations among these typologies and socio-demographic characteristics. In 2013, intercept interviews were completed with 794 adult park visitors at two large parks located in Melbourne, Australia. Latent class analysis identified three classes of visitor: physically active visitor, with dog (12.4%); physically active visitor, with no dog (35.7%); and infrequent, low active, social visitor (51.9%). Respondents who were older and owned a dog had higher odds of being in Class 1 and Class 2. Respondents who had children had higher odds of being in Class 3. Respondents who reported poor health were less likely to be in Class 2 than in Class 3. Park users can be distinguished by the behaviors in which they engage. Understanding typologies of visitors will assist with the development of intervention strategies to optimize park visitation and park-based physical activity."
"Opportunities for biodiversity conservation as cities adapt to climate change Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Cities are investing billions of dollars in climate change adaptation to combat the effects of sea-level rise, temperature extremes, increasingly intense storm events, flooding and water scarcity. Natural ecosystems have enormous potential to contribute to city resilience, and so, actions that rely on this approach could sustain considerable co-benefits for biodiversity. In this paper we identify the prevalence of key themes of human adaptation response that could have biodiversity conservation outcomes in cities. We then quantify the area of impact for actions that identify specific targets for greening or green infrastructure that could involve natural ecosystems, providing an indicator of potential co-benefits to biodiversity. We then extrapolate to explore the total area of land that could benefit from catchment management approaches, the area of waterways that could benefit from nature-based improvement of these spaces, and finally the number of threatened species that could benefit across these cities. From 80 city climate adaptation plans analysed, we found that urban greening plays a key role in most adaptation strategies, and represents an enormous opportunity for biodiversity conservation, given the diversity of animal and plant species in urban environments. We show that the ranges of at least 270 threatened species overlap with the area covered by just 58 city adaptation plans, including watershed catchments totalling over 28 million km2. However, an analysis of 80 city adaptation plans (of a total 151 found globally) shows that this opportunity is being missed. Just 18% of the plans assessed contained specific intentions to promote biodiversity. We highlight this missed opportunity, as climate adaptation actions undertaken by cities represent an enormous incipient opportunity for nature conservation. Finally, we encourage planners and city governments to incorporate biological conservation into climate adaption plans, for the mutual benefit of urban societies and their biodiversity."
"Highly Living Stars via Core-First Photo-RAFT Polymerization: Exploitation for Ultra-High Molecular Weight Star Synthesis Trithiocarbonic Acid; Reversible; Block Copolymers Star polymers are highly functional materials that display unique properties in comparison to linear polymers, making them valuable in a wide range of applications. Currently, ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) star polymers synthesized using controlled radical polymerization are prone to termination reactions that have undesirable effects, such as star-star coupling. Herein, we report the synthesis of the largest star polymers to date using controlled radical techniques via xanthate-mediated photo-reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization using a core-first approach. Polymerization from xanthate-functionalized cores was highly living, enabling the synthesis of well-defined star polymers with molecular weights in excess of 20 MDa."
"Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence and CSR: Radical Feminist Theory and a Human Rights Perspective Fair Trade; Global Value Chains; Global Production Networks This paper extends Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) scholarship to focus on issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence. Despite a significant body of work on gender and CSR from a variety of feminist perspectives, long-standing evidence of sexual harassment and sexual violence in business, particularly in global value chains, and the rise of the #MeToo movement, there has been little scholarship focused specifically on these issues in the context of CSR. Our conceptual paper addresses this gap in the literature through two key contributions. First, we extend the theoretical base of CSR scholarship by drawing upon and explicating radical feminist theory, a resource that has been underutilized in the field to date. This theoretical perspective is well placed to offer insights around the issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence, and to explain the centrality of these concerns to the gender equality agenda in business and in CSR. Second, building upon insights from radical feminism, and from research on CSR and human rights, we explicate a business and human rights approach to sexual harassment, sexual violence and CSR. We point to ways in which this approach might be more effective in addressing these issues than previously adopted strategies and suggest directions for future research arising from our analysis."
"The economic dynamics and population change of Australia’s regional cities Regional Development; Leadership; Governance Arrangement Key points This analysis is based on data from the 2011 and 2016 censuses, and does not take into account the redistributions and changes that may have occurred with COVID-19. This report can be seen as providing a baseline for subsequent analysis of the changes that have occurred and continue to occur, identifying the trends and conditions across regional Australiaâ€™s urban centres prior to 2020. Populations in regional urban centres are growing overallâ€”however, this growth is differentiated. Regional urban centre population growth is associated with proximity to major cities, and to coastal locations. Regional urban centre population decline is associated with remoteness and exposure to the resource economy. Capital cities are the main source of migration to regional urban centres, principally coastal and satellite centres with regional-to-regional-centre migration highly self-contained. International migration follows similar distribution. Commuting between regional centres and proximate capital cities increased over 2011â€“2016, indicating increased peri-metropolitan dependency on metropolitan interactions. Employment growth is associated with population growth, particularly for the larger metropolitan satellite and coastal regional citiesâ€”however, this is also associated with lower wage growth due to the employment mix. Health, community service, construction, hospitality and accommodation increased their share of regional employment. Industries associated with agglomeration economies are concentrating in fewer urban centres, while those associated with population services are becoming more dispersed. National economic growth factors appear to expert greater influence on employment growth in regional urban centres, while industry factors exert very limited influence. Regional effects exert greater influence than industry effects, although these are unevenly distributed. In 135 of 198 cases, a regional urban centre exhibits employment growth along with its surrounding functional economic region. For 33 regional urban centres there is positive divergence, while for 25 there is negative divergence. Four regional urban centres are declining within a declining functional economic region. Factors associated with stronger employment growth include employment factors, industry factors (especially those dependent on population growth), while income growth was less associated with employment growth. Population change exerted a strong influence on employment growth, as did human capital factors. Housing market (i.e. price) growth is strongly associated with population growth, while locational factors exhibited low associations. Cluster analysis identified nine distinctive regional urban centre groups: metro-satellites; large regional cities; medium growth cities; regional service centres; ageing population centres; agricultural centres; mining centres; industrial centres, and northern Queensland centres. Policy development should consider the following: Policy and planning measures to address the phenomenon of growth in metropolitan satellite regional urban centres, and the need to ensure coherent population, housing and employment distribution and linkages. Coordinated economic and social development approaches to emerging low-income service economies in coastal regional urban centres. Long-term transition planning to address resource-dependent regional urban centres facing cyclical economic changes based on the labour intensity of construction relative to ongoing economic activity. Opportunities and mechanisms to leverage high-wage economic development from existing regional city industry clusters. Opportunities and mechanisms for regional spatial coordination of fiscal policy to optimise development of high-wage employment in suitable regional urban centres. The study Purpose The contribution of regional urban centres to Australiaâ€™s economic and population growth has been a topic of growing policy interest in the past two decades, as a result of rapid growth in the major cities and concerns for parts of regional Australia that have experienced population decline. Associated with these trends is the distribution of economic activity and employmentâ€”particularly as traditional regional strengths such as agriculture, manufacturing and mining have declined as sources of employment in recent decades. Over the same period, metropolitan areas have prospered because of concentrations of high-skill, high-wage knowledge work, indicating diverging regional fortunes as a result of wider economic trends. The purpose of this research is to investigate patterns and dynamics of population, migration and economic change in Australian regional urban centres 2011â€“2016. The research is principally an empirically focused investigation identifying patterns and dynamic processes of regional change using advanced spatial analytical techniques, but provides an information base that will support future policy development efforts. Inquiry This research is part of a wider AHURI Inquiry into population growth in Australiaâ€™s smaller cities. The Inquiry asks two overarching questions: First, what is the capacity of Australiaâ€™s smaller cities to assist in managing national population growth, including international and national migration? Second, which policy instruments and programs are most likely to redirect population movements to these locations? Study This research investigates two overarching questions related to the Inquiry: How can we differentiate Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres according to economic profile, population trajectory, industry structure and geography? What are the current mobility and settlement patterns of migrants, including those arriving from other parts of Australia and from other nations, across these smaller cities? Three further research questions are posed by this project: 1. How can a typology of smaller cities assist to understand their role in regional, state and national economies? 2. How are Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres differentiated in terms of economic profile, population trajectory and industry structure? 3. What demographic, economic and spatial factors are associated with economic and population growth, and what attributes are associated with better economic performance of regional urban centres? Approach and methods For Research question 1: the project undertakes longitudinal measures of social, demographic and industry change in regional cities 2011â€“2016 using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census data. Next, flow analysis and mapping of migration is applied to identify key migration patterns. Migration flows are used to construct migration regions via modularity analysis. Similar techniques are used to identify journey to work flows from which functional economic regions are constructed. Shift share of employment change and location quotient analysis of employment is used to understand economic change and industry structure. For Research question 2, to understand how Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres are differentiated the project applies hierarchical cluster and discriminant analysis to construct a typology of regional urban centres. This is based on a combination of economic, demographic and geographic factors. These are compiled into summary data and descriptive explanations. For Research question 3: the study applies structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify the relationships between economic, social and demographic factors affecting population change and economic growth in regional urban centres. Key findings Differentiating Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres Australiaâ€™s regional urban centres are heterogeneous in terms of size, location within the Australian continent and settlement structures, level of employment, industrial mix and degree of interaction with regional, metropolitan, national and international economic processes and dynamics. In 2016, there were 198 Australian regional urban centres that had populations greater than 5,000 residents. Most are experiencing population growth. However this growth is differentiated across a range of factors, including: the existing size of the centre location relative to the coast location relative to an existing major capital city. A small number of regional urban centres are experiencing population decline. These centres are largely associated with the resource economy. They are typically positioned in remote locations in Australia. Migration Migration is a major factor in population change within regional urban centres. Migration patterns are clearly structured at the regional scale, with distinct geographies of intra-regional movement that include discernible levels of self-containment. There is a sizeable phenomenon of major city to regional urban centre migration, especially in the south-east of Australia. Beyond the major metropolitan zones, there are larger internally connected migration regions, which often involving movement between adjacent regional urban centres. Some regional urban centres lose and receive populations across long distances. For example, the Northern Territory (NT) operates as a single migration region, partly because of its relatively small population and large scaleâ€”although the volumes of movement are relatively small."
"Patterns of tree removal and canopy change on public and private land in the City of Melbourne Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Many cities face a struggle to reconcile ambitious tree canopy cover targets with urban development pressures. Canopy cover in The City of Melbourne, Australia, which has a target of 40 % canopy cover on public land by 2040, was analysed together with individual tree removal data, with particular focus on how many street trees were removed near major development sites between 2008 and 2017. We observed major gains and losses of canopy, resulting in small net changes. Our analyses showed a net gain in tree canopy cover in public streets and a net loss of canopy cover in public parks and private properties. The most frequently removed trees in both public parks and streets were small (<15 cm stem diameter). In contrast, more large, exotic trees were removed from public parks than public streetscapes. These large park trees represented a small proportion of total tree removals, but had larger stem basal areas and therefore large canopies. From 2008 to 2017, almost 2000 street trees were removed within 10 m of major development sites, equivalent to almost 20 % of all street trees removed in that time period, but this constituted only 8% of streetscape tree canopy cover losses. These findings suggest that in The City of Melbourne, mature tree succession and removal in parks has the greatest potential to hinder the achievement of canopy cover targets. Canopy cover gains could be maximised through improvements in the establishment and survival of replacement trees in both parks and streetscapes. The protection of the existing urban forest, through policy and practice, will also be critical for the retention and enhancement of tree canopy cover."
"Reviewing indoor environmental quality of high-rise social housing Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Office Buildings People spend most of their time indoors and majority of this time is spent inside their homes. The vulnerable population, including those with low-income, consider housing as central to their lives. More so for the elderly and sick as they stay inside their residences for even longer times. In Australia, almost 14% of the population live below poverty line. Therefore, social housing for low-income population is key to the national housing sector. In Melbourne, many social housing are single-sided units in high-rise buildings. The indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in these units is generally poor due to building design and characteristics, lack of maintenance and absence of appropriate heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems, causing health-related problems to a vulnerable group. This paper will present a critical review of the IEQ in social housing units in high-rise buildings and its impact on occupant health and comfort. This paper will also explore the interrelationships between the IEQ factors to get a holistic view of their performance focusing on how the design of the building envelope and the provision of windows affect the overall indoor environment of the residential units."
"The influence of food waste rearing substrates on black soldier fly larvae protein composition: A systematic review Edible Insects; Hermetia Illucens; Insect The Black Soldier Fly (BSF) offers the potential to address two global challenges; the environmental detriments of food waste and the rising demand for protein. Food waste digested by BSF larvae can be converted into biomass, which may then be utilized for the development of value-added products including new food sources for human and animal consumption. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies investigating the influence of food waste rearing substrates on BSF larvae protein composition. Of 1712 articles identified, 23 articles were selected for inclusion. Based on the results of this review, BSF larvae reared on â€˜Fish waste Sardinella auritaâ€™ for two days reported the highest total protein content at 78.8% and BSF larvae reared on various formulations of â€˜Fruit and vegetableâ€™ reported the lowest protein content at 12.9%. This review is the first to examine the influence of food waste on the protein composition of BSF larvae. Major differences in larval rearing conditions and methods utilized to perform nutritional analyses, potentially influenced the reported protein composition of the BSF larvae. While this review has highlighted the role BSF larvae in food waste management and alternative protein development."
"HDPE and PET as Aggregate Replacement in Concrete: Life-cycle assessment, Material Development and a case study Rubber Waste; Mechanical Properties; Tires This paper reports on a comprehensive research program and practical application of concrete made from recycled plastic materials for use in municipal concrete infrastructure. A systematic life-cycle analysis (LCA) is first conducted to evaluate the global warming potential of concrete containing recycled plastic waste. Using the outcomes of this analysis critical allowable plastic aggregate (PA) content which maintains mechanical properties and minimises global warming potential is identified. Using the LCA results as guidance, laboratory investigations at different scales are undertaken to develop mix designs using recycled plastic materials and to characterize the physical, mechanical and durability-related properties of the waste-based concrete products. Having developed concrete mixes that meet practical and commercial requirements, field applications of the concrete mixes as pavement materials were undertaken to demonstrate the concrete has appropriate engineering properties to enable its use in municipal infrastructure. The field demonstrations support the further development of new concretes with viable sustainable alternative materials as aggregate replacement and are expected to encourage industry and end-user take up of recycled plastic waste materials in concrete for municipal construction application."
"Potential for sustainable utilisation of agricultural residues for bioenergy production in Pakistan: An overview Pakistan; Renewable Energy Policy; Fossil Fuel Pakistan's current energy portfolio is problematic due to a lack of proper management and implementation of appropriate energy policies. This densely populated country has a high energy demand that rises yearly and is expected to increase three-fold by 2050. However, fossil fuel resources are continuously depleting by global overuse while negatively impacting the environment through increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This study reviewed the potential for agricultural residues to be used as renewable energy sources for bioenergy production in Pakistan to address the energy-related challenges that would also help in addressing the economic and environmental concerns. First, a comparison was made between the current energy situation, potential renewable energy scenarios, and global trends. Second, greenhouse gas (i.e., CO2) emissions in Pakistan were summarised and compared with other regions. Third, the thermochemical properties of different agricultural residues were reviewed along with varying the options of processing to produce renewable energy such as thermochemical conversion approaches (combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and liquefaction) and biochemical conversion options (anaerobic digestion, and fermentation). Pakistan being an agricultural-based economy, produces vast quantities of agricultural residue biomass, which is mostly underutilized as animal feed, conventional fuel substitutes, left to rot in fields or burnt to get rid, resulting in the vast emissions of greenhouse gases causing severe environmental pollution and smog formation. A considerable share of Pakistan's national energy demand can be fulfilled if these feedstocks are adequately managed and exploited through the energy sector and converted into large-scale bioenergy."
"Public response to installation of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system to residential buildings in Wuhan, China China; Overcapacity; Photovoltaic System Chinese government has been encouraging the deployment of renewable energy resources such as solar PV for many years. However, up to date building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system is still not a common practice in construction industry and encounters many barriers for entry into public realm especially in residential buildings. In this study, a comprehensive survey was conducted in June 2019 to investigate the public responses to and expectations for installing BIPV system to residential buildings in Wuhan, China. A sample size of 206 has been collected from different residential buildings. The results show that agreement is not a real barrier for the installation of BIPV to residential buildings; however, knowledge, technology, economic, social and political barriers are the hurdles for BIPV adoption. Based on the data analysis, some recommendations have been made to address the barriers. The results of this study will assist policymakers and relevant stakeholders of building industry in making informed BIPV-related decisions and in targeting future research and development efforts."
"Challenges and opportunities of the fourth revolution: a brief insight into the future of food Fog Computing; Network Protocol; Internet of Things By 2050, the global population is projected to be in excess of nine billion people. This will result in an increased burden and stress on the food production systems, particularly in adjustments to several stages of the value chain that will require improvements and/or modifications in their effectiveness such as reducing waste, adapting to climate change, food security, and health. Disruptions such as digital agriculture, digital food, food agility, big data, have been utilized to characterize the changes in the way agro-food systems evolve and function, as well as in the approach they have been analyzed, measured, and monitored. It has been long recognized that the food industry is considered as a data driven enterprise. These characteristics are very important as the food industry becomes global and sustainable. The food industry is currently undergoing significant changes, and with this, challenges are occurring. These challenges are brought about from the food chains, climate changes, and the ability to be resilient in the production of food. Furthermore, health and cultural changes to food are occurring, where the diseases of obesity, diabetes, and aging in the population will continue to change the consumerâ€™s patterns and choices; whereby the consumer will be persuaded to choose and eat healthy and more nutritious foods. Indeed, the cultural awareness and social innovation to prevent food waste and therefore improve food security and sustainability will also prove to further complexities. This short review will briefly discuss some of the forefront issues in food value chains with a focus on using technology."
"Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Logic Control for Energy Management of Hybrid Electric Autonomous Vehicles Connected Vehicles; Energy Utilization; Fuel Consumption Autonomous vehicles are aimed to reduce accidents and traffic congestion. Since hybrid electric vehicles offer feasible solutions to reduce energy consumption and emission to the environment, it is expected that autonomous vehicles will be powered through a hybrid electric system compared to other alternatives. In this paper, a hybrid electric autonomous vehicle is studied under significant amount of uncertainty and ambiguity in the road environment and driver behavior. A Type 1 fuzzy logic controller is constructed here to address the uncertainties of driving conditions. The design involves building an intelligent energy management system for the hybrid electric autonomous vehicle. We have also examined the potentials of the Interval Type 2 fuzzy logic control, especially for energy consumption management. Two simulations are implemented, to demonstrate that the intelligent system, proposed trough Type 1 and Interval Type 2 fuzzy logic control, decreases the fuel usage of the vehicle from 6.74 to 6.58 L/100km, respectively. It is also demonstrated that the Interval Type 2 fuzzy logic controller saves more battery life compared to the Type-1 when the vehicle works under uncertain and ambiguous road conditions. Finally, Interval Type-2 fuzzy logic controller facilitates a reduction of carbon footprint in the autonomous vehicle as desired by the automotive industry stakeholders."
"Hybrid spatial–temporal graph convolutional networks for on-street parking availability prediction Parking; Internet Of Things; Cruising With the development of sensors and of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities can provide people with a variety of information for a more convenient life. Effective on-street parking availability prediction can improve parking efficiency and, at times, alleviate city congestion. Conventional methods of parking availability prediction often do not consider the spatialâ€“temporal features of parking duration distributions. To this end, we propose a parking space prediction scheme called the hybrid spatialâ€“temporal graph convolution networks (HST-GCNs). We use graph convolutional networks and gated linear units (GLUs) with a 1D convolutional neural network to obtain the spatial features and the temporal features, respectively. Then, we construct a spatialâ€“temporal convolutional block to obtain the instantaneous spatialâ€“temporal correlations. Based on the similarity of the parking duration distributions, we propose an attention mechanism called dist Att to measure the similarity of parking duration distributions. Through the dist Att mechanism, we add the long-term spatialâ€“ temporal correlations to our spatialâ€“temporal convolutional block, and thus, we can capture complex hybrid spatialâ€“temporal correlations to achieve a higher accuracy of parking availability prediction. Based on real-world datasets, we compare the proposed scheme with the benchmark models. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme has the best performance in predicting the parking occupancy rate."
"The use of the theory of planned behaviour to assess graduate attributes for sustainability Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Higher Education plays an influential role in societal transformation towards sustainability. An understanding of the application of sustainability learning from degree programs in a graduateâ€™s professional practice can serve as an important feedback loop for developing and advancing sustainability in higher education. A knowledge gap exists between graduate learning outcomes and employability skills, with little exploration of the methods to collect evidence of such relationships. This paper presents the results of a study to measure the uptake and application of sustainability attributes by graduates, post degree-completion. The study developed and trialled a graduate attribute assessment tool informed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). The results demonstrate that the graduates sampled understood what was required for them to act sustainably and showed preparedness to act appropriately. However, these actions were moderated by the influence of key stakeholders and work-place contexts."
"The effect of wind and solar power generation on wholesale electricity prices in Australia Costs And Cost Analysis; Bidding Strategy; Electricity Price Our paper investigates the effect of wind and utility-scale solar electricity generation on wholesale electricity prices in Australia over 2010â€“2018. We use both high frequency (30-min) and daily datasets for the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). We estimate autoregressive distributed lag models (ARDL) to decompose the merit order effect of wind and utility-scale solar PV generation over time and across states. We find that an extra GW of dispatched wind capacity decreases the wholesale electricity price by 11 AUD/MWh at the time of generation, while solar capacity by 14 AUD/MWh. The daily merit order effect is lower. We show that the wind merit order effect has been increasing as a function of dispatched wind capacity over time. Despite of this, wholesale electricity prices in Australia have been increasing, predominantly driven by the increase in natural gas prices. Our findings further strengthen the evidence of the merit order effect of renewable energy sources, with important implications for the current energy policy debate in Australia."
"The role of water utilities in urban greening: A case study of Melbourne, Australia Stormwater; Green Infrastructure; Water Melbourne's â€œGreening the Westâ€ (GTW) initiative is a successful example of water utilities actively supporting urban greening through facilitating collaboration between stakeholders. GTW was convened by City West Water in 2011, to bring together 23 partner organisations to protect and enhance urban greening to support community wellbeing. This research involved interviews to determine how GTW works, its challenges, factors for success, achievements, areas for improvement, future directions, and implications. It is found that the existence of GTW has resulted in an additional one million trees planted in Melbourne's western suburbs, and has caused a significant cultural shift within local government."
"Symbolic Intersection of Self-Reflection, Workplace Interaction and Sociocultural Aspects in Shaping Women Identify as Leaders: A Study in Higher Education, Vietnam Workplace; Sexism; Gender Stereotypes The current literature identified the under-representation of women in leadership roles in higher education. Several countries have recognized the absence of women leaders in senior roles. Along with government efforts in various countries, the first thing is that women need to consider themselves as leaders to prepare themselves to take up leadership positions. The purpose of this study is to examine if there is any role of self-reflection, workplace interaction, and sociocultural phenomenon in shaping up the identities of women in higher education institutions (HEIs) in Vietnam. The data was collected from 14 women leaders working in higher education sector in Vietnam. The methodology used in this study to analyse the data was symbolic interaction to understand how women think about themselves asleaders and shape their own identify. The results from the study suggest that there is intersection of all three aspectsâ€”self-reflection, workplace interaction indicating gendered leadership, and sociocultural phenomenon and all these plays a vital role in shaping up the identify of women leaders. The women did not see themselves as leaders due to their family responsibilities, lack of self-confidence, views on gendered leadership at the workplace, and societal pressure. It is suggested to formally train the women, which will boost their self-confidence, and support from institutions and society is also equally important to encourage them to become leaders."
"A comparative study on the nanoindentation behavior, wear resistance and in vitro biocompatibility of SLM manufactured CP–Ti and EBM manufactured Ti64 gyroid scaffolds Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) The present study investigates the nanoindentation behavior, wear resistance and in vitro biocompatibility of SLM manufactured CPâ€“Ti and EBM manufactured Ti64 gyroid scaffolds and the results were compared to those of casting CPâ€“Ti. Both the SLM- and EBM manufactured scaffolds exhibited anisotropic properties with higher reduced modulus (up to 10%) and nanohardness (up to 30%) in the transverse direction than those in building direction. The wear resistance of scaffolds in transverse direction was higher than those of in building direction by up to âˆ¼25% and âˆ¼82% for SLM manufactured CPâ€“Ti and EBM manufactured Ti64 scaffolds, respectively. The SLM manufactured CPâ€“Ti scaffolds displayed significant enhancement in wear resistance over cast dense CPâ€“Ti with 75% lower mean worn height during a nanowear test. The coefficient of friction was varied between 0.11 and 0.24 and exhibited a steady mean value of 0.15â€“0.18 for CPâ€“Ti and Ti64 scaffolds, respectively. During in vitro cell culture study, CPâ€“Ti scaffolds showed higher cell viability and cell adhesion density in comparison to Ti64 scaffolds for all unit cell sizes. Moreover, cell adhesion density of scaffolds with smaller unit cell sizes (G2) are lower than those of larger unit cells (G3). SEM observations confirmed that both the inner space and surfaces of gyroid scaffolds provided a suitable environment for cell migration, attachment and proliferation after cell culture for 7 d. Statement of significance: It is essential to evaluate the properties of EBM/SLM manufactured scaffolds and to determine whether they can meet the tough performance requirements of the biomedical industry. In this study, nanoindentation and nanowear properties of SLM manufactured CPâ€“Ti and EBM manufactured Ti64 gyroid scaffolds with different unit cell sizes and sample orientations were evaluated and compared to cast dense CPâ€“Ti samples. Moreover, the in vitro biocompatibility of the scaffolds was assessed and compared to each other. To our best of knowledge, this type of study on EBM/SLM manufactured CP-Ti and Ti64 scaffolds have not been reported, to date."
"Gender diversity on board of directors: comprehensive analysis of female directorate networks and the linkage between busyness and performance Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence Purpose: Drawing from social capital theory, this study aims to investigate the manifested critical barriers in deriving and implementing gender diversity policies, paying particular attention to the role multiple directorships play in shaping the directorsâ€™ behavior and the dynamic of the board of directors. The study comprehends social capital as a multi-dimensional concept and uses combinations of interconnected internal, external, expressive and instrumental networks. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a mixed-method approach through which the quantitative approach is supplemented by a qualitative research method to comprehensively examine the development and impact of female directorsâ€™ networks in Australia. To do so, a large data set consisting of 2,527 observations of all Australian firms and data emerged from semi-structured interviews with female directors were brought together and analyzed. Findings: The findings reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between the size of womenâ€™s directorate networks and firm performance. The study additionally explicates the key moderating factors influencing the optimal number of multiple directorships. The key power-based and psychological well-being-related benefits of the inter- and intra-organizational interactions and â€œopenâ€ directorate networks for individual directors are further discussed. The findings also elucidate the status quo vis-Ã -vis labyrinth metaphor and excessive numbers of directorships. Social implications: The study should be of interest to those interested in effective gender diversity management. The findings would assist in enabling tangible outcomes for women through advanced processes and systematic investment in and institutionalization of well-structured, equitable opportunities provided via gender-responsive policies dedicated to the education and training of future female directors. Originality/value: Calling for social dialogues and discussions on non-financial factors, this study adds to the scarce literature on influential factors related to diversity management policies and practices on the board of directors."
"Syrian Refugee Migration, Transitions in Migrant Statuses and Future Scenarios of Syrian Mobility Asylum; Human Rights; Protection of Refugees This article analyses the international migrations and statuses of people who left Syria after the outbreak of the civil war. In addition to exploring the dynamics of Syrian refugee migrations since 2011, we also discuss future prospects and possibilities of return. The ambition of the article is twofold. First, we aim to develop and nuance the typology of migrations of Syrians. Secondly, the article seeks to explore useful lessons from former large-scale refugee migrations; that is, knowledge which may hopefully contribute to preparing the relevant institutions and organisations for Syrian migrations in the eventual post-war period. Based on experiences from other post-conflict situations, several possible future scenarios of Syrian migrations are discussed. The proposed typologies of migrants and repatriation regimes may help us understand the nuances, the dynamic of status change and the complexity of the forced migrations. It is maintained that migration trends, reception, and repatriation conditions and policies are highly interconnected. Refugees' responses to reception and repatriation regimes result in transitions in their legal statuses in receiving countries and changing motivations for migration and repatriation."
"Treatment of wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate using alginate-immobilised microalgae: Integrated impact of solution conditions on algal bead performance Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Alginate can be used for entrapment of microalgal cells in gel beads to achieve high-rate treatment of wastewater and can overcome the difficulties of cell separation that would occur in suspended microalgae treatment systems. The potential for alginate beads to disintegrate in the presence of high ion concentrations could limit the use of alginate entrapment for treating municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC). The combined effect of the pH, alkalinity, and salinity of the ROC that impact the physical stability, chemical characteristics, biomass production, and nutrient removal performance of alginate-entrapped Chlorella vulgaris for treating the ROC was investigated. Water adsorption resulting from the loss of calcium from the alginate matrix was the initiating cause of reduction of the algal bead stability. The combination of alkalinity >400 mg/L and pH â‰¥9.5 led to a >65% reduction in compressive strength and thus disintegration of beads during ROC treatment. However, alginate beads of C. vulgaris were sufficiently stable and were capable of nutrient remediation (up to 100% TP and 85% TN per treatment cycle of 48 h over a 10-day period) and biomass production (up to 340 mg/L/d) when salinity, pH, and alkalinity levels were <8 g TDS/L, 7â€“9.5, and <400 mg/L, respectively. Empirical models that were developed and validated could enable the prediction of the performance of the algal beads for various ROC compositions. This study enhances the insight and decision-making regarding the feasibility of the alginate-immobilised microalgal system for treating municipal wastewater ROC streams."
"Large-scale experiment on the behaviour of concrete flat slabs subjected to standard fire Temperature; Flammability; Concrete Slabs The use of concrete flat slabs in multi-storey buildings is increasing, and the current fire design guidelines for flat slabs are based on research carried out a few decades ago. Since then, material properties of concrete and construction techniques have changed, which require new experiments to be carried out to assess the fire performance of concrete flat slabs. In this work, the fire resistance of flat slabs was investigated at a large scale (3.78 m Ã— 4.75 m) under structural loading and exposed to ISO 834 fire conditions. The boundary conditions were partially fixed, compared to previous tests where they were free to expand. These modified boundary conditions simulate closer to the actual conditions and capture the effects of membrane action on punching shear behaviour. No spalling occurred during the 3-h duration of the test. The test was also extended to investigate the behaviour during the cooling phase, as it is critical with restrained support conditions. Results show that the duration of fire resistance is significantly higher than that of similar tests with no lateral restraint. Heat propagation and deformation recovery during the cooling phase were also measured. Improved fire resistance duration suggests that the punching shear resistance is enhanced by restrained support conditions."
"Opportunities for biodiversity conservation as cities adapt to climate change Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Cities are investing billions of dollars in climate change adaptation to combat the effects of sea-level rise, temperature extremes, increasingly intense storm events, flooding and water scarcity. Natural ecosystems have enormous potential to contribute to city resilience, and so, actions that rely on this approach could sustain considerable co-benefits for biodiversity. In this paper we identify the prevalence of key themes of human adaptation response that could have biodiversity conservation outcomes in cities. We then quantify the area of impact for actions that identify specific targets for greening or green infrastructure that could involve natural ecosystems, providing an indicator of potential co-benefits to biodiversity. We then extrapolate to explore the total area of land that could benefit from catchment management approaches, the area of waterways that could benefit from nature-based improvement of these spaces, and finally the number of threatened species that could benefit across these cities. From 80 city climate adaptation plans analysed, we found that urban greening plays a key role in most adaptation strategies, and represents an enormous opportunity for biodiversity conservation, given the diversity of animal and plant species in urban environments. We show that the ranges of at least 270 threatened species overlap with the area covered by just 58 city adaptation plans, including watershed catchments totalling over 28 million km2. However, an analysis of 80 city adaptation plans (of a total 151 found globally) shows that this opportunity is being missed. Just 18% of the plans assessed contained specific intentions to promote biodiversity. We highlight this missed opportunity, as climate adaptation actions undertaken by cities represent an enormous incipient opportunity for nature conservation. Finally, we encourage planners and city governments to incorporate biological conservation into climate adaption plans, for the mutual benefit of urban societies and their biodiversity."
"3D printed dual macro-, microscale porous network as a tissue engineering scaffold with drug delivering function Tissue Engineering; Scaffold; Selective Laser Sintering Tissue engineering macroporous scaffolds are important for regeneration of large volume defects resulting from diseases such as breast or bone cancers. Another important part of the treatment of these conditions is adjuvant drug therapy to prevent disease recurrence or surgical site infection. In this study, we developed a new type of macroporous scaffolds that have drug loading and release functionality to use in these scenarios. 3D printing allows for building macroporous scaffolds with deterministically designed complex architectures for tissue engineering yet they often have low surface areas thus limiting their drug loading capability. In this proof-of-concept study, we aimed to introduce microscale porosity into macroporous scaffolds to allow for efficient yet simple soak-loading of various clinical drugs and control their release. Manufacturing of scaffolds having both macroporosity and microscale porosity remains a difficult task. Here, we combined porogen leaching and 3D printing to achieve this goal. Porogen microparticles were mixed with medical grade polycaprolactone and extruded into scaffolds having macropores of 0.7 mm in size. After leaching, intra-strut microscale pores were realized with pore size of 20-70 Î¼m and a total microscale porosity of nearly 40%. Doxorubicin (DOX), paclitaxel (PTX) and cefazolin (CEF) were chosen as model drugs of different charges and solubilities to soak-load the scaffolds and achieved loading efficiency of over 80%. The microscale porosity was found to significantly reduce the burst release allowing the microporous scaffolds to release drugs up to 200, 500 and 150 h for DOX, PTX and CEF, respectively. Finally, cell assays were used and confirmed the bioactivities and dose response of the drug-loaded scaffolds. Together, the findings from this proof-of-concept study demonstrate a new type of scaffolds with dual micro-, macro-porosity for tissue engineering applications with intrinsic capability for efficient loading and sustained release of drugs to prevent post-surgery complications."
"Synchronous Generator Governor Response: Performance Implications under High Share of Inverter-Based Renewable Energy Sources Inertia; Asynchronous Generators; Wind Farms Inverter-based generation sources' significant uptake has seen most power system operators place a strong focus on unlocking their capability to respond to frequency excursions. Consequently, the effective utilization of conventional generation assets to improve frequency regulation in power systems has received less focus. This letter highlights two crucial aspects (governor deadbands and governor inactivity) pertinent to conventional generation assets, which must be considered by the system operator when operating power systems with a high share of inverter-based sources. Poor governor control is shown to significantly impact frequency regulation, thus undermining power system operation and performance, in an Australian case study. Furthermore, a high share of governor inactivity causes power system instability owing to degradation in governor response. For power systems with a high share of inverter-based sources, implementation of properly chosen governor deadbands and mandatory governor response is recommended to improve system frequency regulation."
"Prediction of public trust in politicians using a multimodal fusion approach Emotion Recognition; Emotional Speech; Emotion This paper explores the automatic prediction of public trust in politicians through the use of speech, text, and visual modalities. It evaluates the effectiveness of each modality individually, and it investigates fusion approaches for integrating information from each modality for prediction using a multimodal setting. A database was created consisting of speech recordings, twitter messages, and images representing fifteen American politicians, and labeling was carried out per a publicly available ranking system. The data were distributed into three trust categories, i.e., the low-trust category, mid-trust category, and high-trust category. First, unimodal prediction using each of the three modalities individually was performed using the database; then, using the outputs of the unimodal predictions, a multimodal prediction was later performed. Unimodal prediction was performed by training three independent logistic regression (LR) classifiers, one each for speech, text, and images. The prediction vectors from the individual modalities were then concatenated before being used to train a multimodal decision-making LR classifier. We report that the best performing modality was speech, which achieved a classification accuracy of 92.81%, followed by the images, achieving an accuracy of 77.96%, whereas the best performing model for text-modality achieved a 72.26% accuracy. With the multimodal approach, the highest classification accuracy of 97.53% was obtained when all three modalities were used for trust prediction. Meanwhile, in a bimodal setup, the best performing combination was that combining the speech and image visual modalities by achieving an accuracy of 95.07%, followed by the speech and text combination, showing an accuracy of 94.40%, whereas the text and images visual modal combination resulted in an accuracy of 83.20%."

Further, it offers selected insights into a founder of our literature as well as a hugely influential early leader of the social and environmental accounting movement."
"Process automation in intelligent transportation system (ITS) Army; Intelligent Transportation Systems; Transportation Infrastructure Collectively, process simulation is an intricate element within an intelligent transport system (ITS); arrange of modeling techniques and subsequent transition operations also form components of such a system. Although the ITS incorporates asset of process automations such as systematic prototypes and simulation, it also integrates computational modeling, and therefore, efficient operational transitions. Processes such as automation, modeling, and operational transitions are at the core of a fastidious ITS. Accordingly, these system elements need to be holistically integrated and amalgamated through effective computationbased methods. Fittingly, the main objective of this study is to examine the utilization of process automation- and computation-based methods as the basis for ITS integration perspectives. In doing so, Sydney Metro will be included as a case study to further elucidate such integration processes."
"Hydrogenolysis of Lignin-Derived Aromatic Ethers over Heterogeneous Catalysts Bio-Oil; Catalyst; Guaiacol Global temperature has risen >1 Â°C since the preindustrial era, resulting in well-documented adverse climate impacts including extreme weather (floods, droughts, storms, and heat waves), a rise in sea level accompanying melting polar and glacial ice, and disrupted crop growth. These changes are closely correlated with anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, predominantly arising from the combustion of nonrenewable fossil fuels. Lignin derived from lignocellulose is the second most abundant biopolymer on Earth, and a rich source of renewable aromatic hydrocarbons to replace those currently obtained from fossil resources. Lignin depolymerization by cleavage of C-O and C-C linkages in the biopolymer can be achieved by direct pyrolysis or catalytic transformations, involving oxidation, hydrolysis, or hydrogenolysis reactions. Hydrogenolysis, in which H2 gas (or in-situ generated reactive H species) is supplied to lignin under relatively mild conditions, has attracted significant attention. This Perspective summarizes recent progress in the development of heterogeneous catalysts for the cleavage of C-O linkages in lignin-derived aromatic ethers by hydrogenolysis: It encompasses strategies using H2, hydrogen transfer, and photocatalysis for aromatic monomers production, and the determination of structure-activity relationships and underlying reaction mechanisms."
"Climate change impacts on pollutants mobilization and interactive effects of climate change and pollutants on toxicity and bioaccumulation of pollutants in estuarine and marine biota and linkage to seafood security Climate Change; Sea Urchins; Acanthochromis Polyacanthus This article provides an overview of the impacts of climate change stressors (temperature, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and hypoxia) on estuarine and marine biota (algae, crustaceans, molluscs, corals, and fish). It also assessed possible/likely interactive impacts (combined impacts of climate change stressors and pollutants) on pollutants mobilization, pollutants toxicity (effects on growth, reproduction, mortality) and pollutants bioaccumulation in estuarine and marine biota. An increase in temperature and extreme events may enhance the release, degradation, transportation, and mobilization of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic pollutants in the estuarine and marine environments. Based on the available pollutants' toxicity trend data and information it reveals that the toxicity of several high-risk pollutants may increase with increasing levels of climate change stressors. It is likely that the interactive effects of climate change and pollutants may enhance the bioaccumulation of pollutants in seafood organisms. There is a paucity of literature relating to realistic interactive effects of climate change and pollutants. Therefore, future research should be directed towards the combined effects of climate change stressors and pollutants on estuarine and marine bota. A sustainable solution for pollution control caused by both greenhouse gas emissions (that cause climate change) and chemical pollutants would be required to safeguard the estuarine and marine biota."
"The impact of terrestrial protected areas on vegetation extent and condition: A systematic review protocol Systematic Review; Collating; Conservation Management Background: Establishing protected areas is a key approach to protecting nature. However, protected areas are often biased towards remote and less productive lands. It is important to evaluate the impacts protected areas have had, or in other words, what changes in outcomes of interest are attributable to protected areas. Studies that evaluate the impact of protected areas on vegetation - the state and processes that support biodiversity - are scarce and published in a range of disciplines. This systematic review will scope, identify, and synthesize studies that quantitatively measure the impact of protected areas on vegetation extent and condition. The findings will be useful for researchers and policy makers and provide important knowledge for setting post 2020 targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity. This review will also identify research gaps in the current evidence base and provide direction for future research. Methods: This review follows the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence guidelines for evidence synthesis and complies with the ROSES (RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Synthesis) reporting framework. We will use a comprehensive search strategy developed through several rounds of scoping review to cover databases; Web of Science, Scopus and CAB Abstracts, 16 organizational websites, google scholar and existing review documents. Our search terms and strategies aim to find impact evaluation studies (both peer-reviewed and grey literature) in English from protected areas globally. The search results will be screened at title, abstract, and then full text by two independent reviewers. A quality appraisal of evidence will be conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) risk of bias tool. Review results will be presented in the form of narrative synthesis, as well as in meta-analysis form, where data quality and amount allow."
"High oxygen-content titanium and titanium alloys made from powder Sintering; Powder Metallurgy; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4) Oxygen remains to be a central issue in the manufacture of titanium (Ti) and its alloys from powder. The strong and short-range repulsion between interstitial oxygen and screw dislocation core strengthens titanium but compromises its resistance to cracking. It is therefore challenging to produce strong and ductile (tensile) Ti materials from high oxygen-content powder. This article reviews the tensile properties of high oxygen-content Î±-Ti, (Î±+Î²)-Ti alloys, and Î²-Ti alloys made from powder. A minimum tensile ductility value of 6% is used to define ductile Ti according to existing technical specifications for Ti-6Al-4V and other powder metallurgy materials. Two post-processing methods, solution heat treatment and thermomechanical processing, are identified to be effective remedies to convert non-ductile high oxygen-content Ti alloys into ductile ones. The underlying ductility-improvement mechanisms are discussed, which vary with alloy system. In particular, redistribution of oxygen between Î± and Î² phases by solution heat treatment offers a practical remedy to substantially improve tensile ductility, e.g., from 6% to 19% for the Ti-0.94 wt%O alloy. It is shown that appropriate post processing can enable a wide variety of Ti alloys made from powder to tolerate â‰¥0.5 wt%O for â‰¥6% tensile ductility for structural applications."
"Wastewater recycling in Antarctica: Performance assessment of an advanced water treatment plant in removing trace organic chemicals Ethinylestradiol; Endocrine Disruptors; Wastewater Treatment The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) operates Australia's Davis Station in the Antarctic. In 2005, Davis Station's wastewater treatment plant failed and since then untreated, macerated effluent has been discharged to the ocean. The objectives of this study were to determine whether an advanced water treatment plant (AWTP) commissioned by the AAD and featuring a multi-barrier process involving ozonation, ceramic microfiltration, biologically activated carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, ultraviolet disinfection and chlorination was capable of producing potable water and a non-toxic brine concentrate that can be discharged with minimal environmental impact. The AWTP was tested using water from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Tasmania, Australia. We used spot water and passive sampling combined with two multi-residue chromatographic-mass spectrometric methods and a range of recombinant receptor-reporter gene bioassays to screen trace organic chemicals (TrOCs), toxicity and receptor activity in the Feed water, in the environmental discharge (reject water), and product water from the AWTP for six months during 2014â€“15, and then again for three months in 2016. Across the two surveys we unambiguously detected 109 different TrOCs in the feed water, 39 chemicals in the reject water, and 34 chemicals in the product water. Sample toxicity and receptor activity in the feed water samples was almost totally removed in both testing periods, confirming that the vast majority of the receptor active TrOCs were removed by the treatment process. All the NDMA entering the AWTP in the feed and/or produced in the plant (typically < 50 ng/L), was retained into the reject water with no NDMA observed in the product water. In conclusion, the AWTP was working to design, and releases of TrOCs at the concentrations observed in this study would be unlikely cause adverse effects on populations of aquatic organisms in the receiving environment or users of the potable product water."
"Income inequality and renewable energy consumption: Time-varying non-parametric evidence Environmental Kuznets Curve; China; Trade Openness We examine the effect of income inequality on renewable energy consumption, and its disaggregated components, for a panel of 17 nations over the period 1990 to 2016. We assess this relationship in a dynamic framework by tracing the time-varying evolution using non-parametric techniques. This framework enables us to pin down, at each point in time, the effect of income inequality on renewable energy and how the relationship evolved over time. The results show a time-varying effect, where for a short period between 1995 and 2002, the relationship was negative. From 2010 onwards the relationship then switches to positive. We also observe heterogeneous effects of income inequality depending on the measure of renewable energy used. The time-varying effects reflect that income inequality influences renewable energy consumption via various channels, and at specific times, some channels appear to be more dominant. Thus, the findings from this study highlight the need for policymakers to pay close attention to the role of income inequality when developing policies for the uptake of or transition to renewable energy, and particularly the need to be dynamic with policy formulation, taking into account the channels through which income inequality works."
"Ethnic diversity, energy poverty and the mediating role of trust: Evidence from household panel data for Australia1 Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Energy poverty is now a major concern on the public policy agenda in many countries. However, evidence on the determinants of energy poverty is relatively scant. Our study contributes to the debate on the determinants of energy poverty by being the first to examine the impact of ethnic diversity on household energy poverty. Using 12 waves of longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, we find that, in Australia, ethnic diversity is positively associated with energy poverty. Our preferred instrumented estimates suggest that a standard deviation increase in ethnic diversity is associated with a 0.103â€“0.422 standard deviation increase in energy poverty, depending on how energy poverty is measured. This finding is generally robust to alternative ways of measuring ethnic diversity and energy poverty. We identify trust as an important channel through which ethnic diversity operates and point to the need for policies that engender social capital in multicultural societies as a means to harness the benefits of diversity."
"A Review on Multi-Terminal High Voltage Direct Current Networks for Wind Power Integration High Voltage Direct Current System; Offshore Wind Farms; Converter With the growing pressure to substitute fossil fuel-based generation, Renewable Energy Sources (RES) have become one of the main solutions from the power sector in the fight against climate change. Offshore wind farms, for example, are an interesting alternative to increase renewable power production, but they represent a challenge when being interconnected to the grid, since new installations are being pushed further off the coast due to noise and visual pollution restrictions. In this context, Multi-Terminal High Voltage Direct Current (MT-HVDC) networks are the most preferred technology for this purpose and for onshore grid reinforcements. They also enable the delivery of power from the shore to offshore Oil and Gas (O&G) production platforms, which can help lower the emissions in the transition away from fossil fuels. In this work, we review relevant aspects of the operation and control of MT-HVDC networks for wind power integration. The review approaches topics such as the main characteristics of MT-HVDC projects under discussion/commissioned around the world, rising challenges in the control and the operation of MT-HVDC networks and the modeling and the control of the Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) stations. To illustrate the challenges on designing the control system of a MT-HVDC network and to corroborate the technical discussions, a simulation of a three-terminal MT-HVDC network integrating wind power generation and offshore O&G production units to the onshore grid is performed in Matlabâ€™s Simscape Electrical toolbox. The results highlight the main differences between two alternatives to design the control system for an MT-HVDC network."
"Sustainable desalination by permeate gap membrane distillation technology Distillation; Direct Contact; Membrane Membrane distillation (MD) as a thermally driven process with moderate operating temperatures is a known effective technology for saltwater desalination. In this chapter, the permeate gap membrane distillation (PGMD) configuration, as a novel sustainable MD design having internal heat recovery characteristics, is introduced and numerical modeling of the heat and mass transfer phenomena in this configuration is studied. To investigate the efficiency of the PGMD system, the results of two experimental projects are described one a laboratory-scale flat PGMD rig, which was developed at RMIT University, and the other, for commercial-scale PGMD modules, which was developed by the Franhaufer Institute. Moreover, in this chapter, a literature survey is included based on recent case studies involving MD integrated with different sources of solar energy and those driven by waste heat. The chapter is completed by a general techno-economic feasibility study of PGMD systems."
"Cohesion: Our environment—building better and smarter Snow Making; Skiing; Skis The world is rapidly changing. Climate change is recognised as one of the greatest challenges facing the world today, and Australia is not an exception (see Chapter â€œ Urban Climates in the Transformation of Australian Cities â€). Environmental degradation is mainly due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. We are already seeing changes to weather patterns and more extreme and frequent weather events. This impacts on our built environment, our cities and our way of life. For example, hotter weather causes rising electricity demand due to increased requirements for cooling in buildings. A changing climate is also creating significant health and well-being challenges, especially during extreme weather events. The built environment is a significant contributor to rising greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing energy demand over recent decades, mostly from fossil fuel, needs to be addressed if the built environment is to transition to a low carbon and sustainable future. This chapter touches on the key themes emerging from the preceding chapters and discusses what they mean for achieving a sustainable built environment, not only in Australia but globally."
"Effect of street design on pedestrian thermal comfort Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Microclimate The number of people living in urban areas is projected to increase significantly in most of the cities around the world. To address the future population increase, local governments develop new planning scenarios to increase the density in certain areas that can accommodate the growth. However, the potential threat to human health and pedestrian comfort will be exacerbated, if planning professionals exclude climatic conscious urban design in their practices. Increasing numbers of the hot days and frequent occurrence of heatwave events cause a serious threat to human life. This study investigates the effect of the future structural plans on pedestrian thermal comfort through numerical simulation using City North, Melbourne as a case study. The effect of street design towards the development of a comfortable microclimate at street level for pedestrians is investigated. To provide knowledge readily interpretable from the planning perspective, the existing and future scenarios for different street profiles are modelled and the consequences of microclimatic parameters and thermal comfort are assessed. A three-dimensional numerical modelling system, ENVI-met was used for the simulation. A clear reduction of average daytime temperature (T), mean radiant temperature (MRT) and Physiological Equivalent Temperatures (PET) were observed across the study area after implementing the â€˜Plan Melbourneâ€™ strategies. The outcomes of this study will assist urban planners in developing policies which can effectively decrease the vulnerability to the heat stress at the pedestrian level."
"Transdisciplinary system of systems development in the trend to X4.0 for intelligent manufacturing System of Systems; Systems Engineering; Software Architecture Since the announcement of Industry 4.0 in 2012, multiple variants of this industry paradigm have emerged and built on the common platform of Internet of Things. Engineering-driven industries such as aerospace and automotive and process-driven industries such as water treatment and food processing are influenced similarly trying to adapt to the so-called fourth generation (4.0) paradigm. In essence, the main outcomes of these X4.0 adaptations (where X can be any one of Quality, Water, Procurement, Gas or a combination of industries) are the facilitation of communications between socio-technical systems and the accumulation large amount of data. As the X4.0 paradigms are researched, defined, developed and applied, many real-world examples in a variety of industries have demonstrated a lack of system of systems design consideration. Participants are inhibited from working seamlessly and lag behind events triggered in the hostile real-world internet environment. This paper examines, from a high-level system of systems perspective, how transdisciplinary engineering can create a model of evolutionary X4.0 and how intelligent manufacturing can be developed towards X4.0 within the transdisciplinary modelling framework."

"Digital arts and culture in Australia: Promissory discourses and uncertain realities in pandemic times Technology Push; Digital Storage; Outages This article critically interrogates the promissory discourse underpinning the cultural sectorsâ€™ â€˜digital pivotâ€™ in the wake of COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 and 2021; namely, that artistic and creative work could be done lucratively online, offer equal opportunities for all, and assure ongoing audience consumption. Drawing on empirical data from two research projects with arts and culture workers in Australia during COVID-19 restrictions, we investigate the intersection of this promissory discourse with individual and institutional practices of digital disengagement. We contend that, rather than a panacea to lost work and income and the assurance of continued cultural consumption, digital disengagement meant that the pivot prohibited, multiplied, and negated artistic and cultural labour. By considering disengagement that was imposed upon, resourcing contingent, and that actively pushed back, this article complicates our understanding of digitalised arts and cultural labour."
"Analysis of Bilateral Air Services Agreement Liberalization in Australia Aircraft; Airline Industry; Airfare This paper examines an assessment of the level of air transport services liberalization in Australia in order to generate recommendations on what key market access features of Air Services Agreements should be revised to reflect the changes in air transport characteristics, including the increase in air cargo traffic during the COVID-19 period. The different variants of the key market access features of ASA, levels of air transport liberalization and the extent of air transport service liberalization between Australia and 104 partner countries were analysed using descriptive study, comparison analysis and the ALI index. The ALI index is calculated for four different weighting schemes. Passenger capacity in 41 bilateral agreements contain restrictions of frequency, capacity and aircraft type. The analysis of cooperative arrangements indicated that Australia has a single aviation market only with New Zealand. The cargo capacity analysis identified different types of capacity restrictions based on weekly cargo service, volume, destinations, designated airline and aircraft types. In conclusion, cargo capacity analysis illustrates that the level of liberalization is high, but the air services agreements between Australia and other countries in the first and second cargo capacity groups should be revised to reflect the increase in air cargo traffic during COVID-19."
"Macromarketing Our Way to a Zero-carbon Future Introduction; Marketing Systems; History of Marketing Thought The role of marketing in climate change is one of the most pressing, and yet understudied, issues of our time. While climate change forms part of the wider sustainability canon, it transcends issues-based scholarship. Macromarketers are ideally suited to taking on this challenge. This special section takes a step towards addressing the current shortfall in knowledge by creating the first collection of macromarketing work addressing marketing's role in the climate emergency. Reflecting the nature of sustainability (nascent, complex, diffuse, diverse), the three papers take widely different approaches; examining the interactions between markets, communities and the environment. Drawing on action research, case study and experimental data, the author teams explore systems interactions in fishing communities, marketing strategy in the fashion industry, and anti-consumption initiatives in social media respectively. The guest editors call on all marketers to build on this important work, and to help pivot our discipline towards a necessary zero carbon future."
"Implementation of recycling cigarette butts in lightweight bricks and a proposal for ending the littering of cigarette butts in our cities Tobacco; Smoking; Leachates Our cities, parks, beaches, and oceans have been contaminated for many years with millions of tonnes of unsightly and toxic cigarette butts (CBs). This study presents and discusses some of the results of an ongoing study on recycling in fired-clay bricks. Energy savings: the energy value of CBs with remnant tobacco was found to be 16.5 MJ/kg. If just 2.5% of all bricks produced annually worldwide included 1% CB content, all of the CBs currently produced could be recycled in bricks, and it is estimated that global firing energy consumption could be reduced by approximately 20 billion MJ (megajoules). This approximately equates to the power used by one million homes in Victoria, Australia, every year. Bacteriological study: CBs were investigated for the presence of ten common bacteria in two pilot studies. Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected in fresh used CB samples, and Listeria spp. were detected in old used CB samples. All of the CB samples except the dried sample had significant counts of Bacillus spp. Some species of the detected bacteria in this study are pathogenic. Further confirmation and comprehensive microbiological study are needed in this area. The contact of naphthalene balls with CBs had a significant disinfecting effect on Bacillus spp. The implementation procedure for recycling CBs in bricks, odour from Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions in CBs, sterilization methods, CB collection systems, and safety instructions were investigated, and they are discussed. Proposal: when considering the combined risks from many highly toxic chemicals and possible pathogens in cigarette butts, it is proposed that littering of this waste anywhere in cities and the environment be strictly prohibited and that offenders be heavily fined."
"Recycling industrial slags in production of fired clay bricks for sustainable manufacturing Clay Brick; Brick; Husk Ash Due to the production of industrial slags in massive amounts, there is a high demand for recycling these slags and avoiding their dumping in landfills. This article aims to recycle industrial slags in brick manufacturing and investigates the performance of fired clay bricks incorporating different kinds of industrial slags such as granulated blast furnace slag (GBS), ferrochromium slag (FCS), and steel slag (STS). For this purpose, two different dosages of slags (i.e., 10 and 20 wt % of clay) and two different firing temperatures (i.e., 1000 and 1100 oC) were considered. Various physical, mechanical, and durability tests were performed to evaluate the properties of bricks incorporating industrial slags. Results show that the compressive strength of the bricks incorporating industrial slags are well above the minimum compressive strength limits of bricks as per different building standards. The bricks incorporating industrial slag can be classified as load-bearing bricks for structural applications in accordance with the ASTM C469 standard. An increase in the porosity of bricks is observed with the addition of STS. However, reduced porosity is observed for bricks incorporating FCS and GBS than traditional bricks. Based on the water absorption and efflorescence test results, bricks incorporating industrial slags can be used as severe weather resistant bricks following ASTM C62 standard and slight efflorescence bricks per ASTM C67 standard. The amounts of heavy metals in the leachates of bricks are observed below the specified limits of the Environment Protection Authority. SEM images and EDS analysis of bricks are also supporting the results of this study. Based on the results, utilizing industrial slags in brick manufacturing can help recycle the abundant industrial wastes and develop the fired clay bricks with desired properties."
"Elite capture of local participatory governance Citizen Participation; Local Government; Publicity Elite capture is a major barrier to citizen engagement in local governance processes in many developing countries. Data from six case studies of development initiatives in Bangladesh show that, in spite of attempts by aid donors and others to ensure citizen participation, programmes are dominated by a nexus of local elites including MPs and bureaucrats. Local stakeholders do not understand the value that direct citizen participation can bring, and citizens are unaware of their rights and wary of challenging elites. Monitoring of requirements for citizen participation is weak, and the management of some programmes deters participation. Representatives are sometimes selected by elites and legal frameworks are not sufficiently strong or enforced consistently. We conclude that a range of additional and effectively implemented policy measures are required to reduce the extent and effects of elite capture in developing countries."
"The Environmental Kuznets Curve across Australian states and territories Environmental Kuznets Curve; China; Trade Openness We test the Environmental Kuznets Curves (EKC) hypothesis for a panel of eight Australian states and territories using non-parametric panel estimation over the period 1990 to 2017. A feature of our non-parametric estimation method is that it allows carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to evolve over time in the form of an unknown functional form with confidence bands constructed using a wild bootstrapping method. This framework has the advantage that we can plot the time-varying relationship between Gross State Product (GSP) and CO2 emissions. The non-parametric local linear estimates for GSP are consistent with a conventional inverted U-shaped EKC, which peaks in 2010 and declines thereafter. The peak coincides with a significant policy shift in Australia's commitment to reducing CO2 emissions, whereby, in 2010, the Australian Government, and subsequently the states and territories, pledged to reduce CO2 emissions to 5% below 2000 levels by 2020 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (the Cancun Agreement)."
"Instantaneous resistivity vector difference used to simulate the seepage of polymer flooding in an oilfield Braided River; Oil; Geophysical Logging The instantaneous resistivity vector difference provides a method for monitoring the predominant seepage path of oil in real time remaining in a reservoir by numerical simulation. The target stratum in Shahejie Formation, Bohai Bay Basin, eastern North China has a relatively high resistivity (15â€“25 Î© m), which is reduced to 3â€“10 Î© m with the in-pouring of viscous polymerâ€“water solutions. The instantaneous resistivity (Ït) of each monitored well-point changes with the continuous injection of polymer. Mitchell's improved model calculates Ït for every well-point at time t, and its reliability is verified by the core-displacement and production-logging methods. Using first-order differences and a differential model to recognize anomalous changes in the target zone, we can effectively extract and highlight changes in the resistivity of the target layer caused by polymer injection, and determine the distribution of resistivity. The position of maximum change in instantaneous resistivity in each direction can be calculated using second-order differences, with the zero line reflecting the boundary position of the anomalous body. The Ït differential results is consistent with 3H tracking results. This study aimed to determine the characteristics of the predominant seepage field in the study area, provide real-time technical support for the deployment and adjustment of polymer flooding schemes avoiding an inefficient polymer cycle, and improve the tertiary recovery factor of oilfields."
"KNi0.8Co0.2F3as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Nonaqueous Li-O2Batteries Lithium-air Batteries; Electrocatalysts; Battery The rechargeable nonaqueous Li-O2battery provides an ultrahigh theoretical energy density for energy storage application. However, its electrochemical performance is significantly hindered by numerous challenges including short cycle life, lower round-trip efficiency, and insulation caused by lithium peroxide (Li2O2) that results in a large overpotential. Utilizing known merits of fluoride perovskite structures and building on previous studies in an aqueous electrolyte, KNi0.8Co0.2F3(KNCF82), shows promise as a Li-O2battery electrocatalyst. When placed in a nonaqueous rechargeable Li-O2battery, the KNCF82 cathode demonstrates an improved specific capacity of âˆ¼9600 mA h g-1at a current density of 175 mA g-1. The battery shows a cycling stability for 85 cycles with a narrow charge-discharge voltage difference of 1.41 V when the capacity was regulated at 500 mA g-1and a round-trip efficiency of 63%. Further, despite a slight increase in overpotential, the cell exhibited good stability for 145 cycles and cycled over 835 h."
"The Impact of Multilingualism on Reporting Domestic Violence in Mozambique Portugal; FRELIMO; Estado Novo This article examines the linguistic environment in which police and justice agencies conduct interviews in domestic violence cases in Maputo, Mozambique. In Maputo, most people speak one or more African languages and many do not speak the official language, Portuguese, fluently. Moreover, a complex justice environment in Maputo incorporates customary law such as community-based mediation. This article examines justice and civil society stakeholder attitudes towards the role of language in the justice system. Interviews with staff from ten agencies indicate that stakeholders recognise the positive value for victim- survivors of domestic violence to tell their story in their own language. However, stakeholder agencies sometimes act as â€œlinguistic gate-keepersâ€ and the authors conclude that a suitable first step in improving the stateâ€™s response to domestic violence is the development of tools to support agency staff at all levels in explaining legal terminology and processes in simple Portuguese, or local language translations."
"Engineering Poly(ethylene glycol) Nanoparticles for Accelerated Blood Clearance Inhibition and Targeted Drug Delivery Antibodies; Liposomes; Macrogol Surface modification with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEGylation) is an effective strategy to improve the colloidal stability of nanoparticles (NPs) and is often used to minimize cellular uptake and clearance of NPs by the immune system. However, PEGylation can also trigger the accelerated blood clearance (ABC) phenomenon, which is known to reduce the circulation time of PEGylated NPs. Herein, we report the engineering of stealth PEG NPs that can avoid the ABC phenomenon and, when modified with hyaluronic acid (HA), show specific cancer cell targeting and drug delivery. PEG NPs cross-linked with disulfide bonds are prepared by using zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 NPs as templates. The reported templating strategy enables the simultaneous removal of the template and formation of PEG NPs under mild conditions (pH 5.5 buffer). Compared to PEGylated liposomes, PEG NPs avoid the secretion of anti-PEG antibodies and the presence of anti-PEG IgM and IgG did not significantly accelerate the blood clearance of PEG NPs, indicating the inhibition of the ABC effect for the PEG NPs. Functionalization of the PEG NPs with HA affords PEG NPs that retain their stealth properties against macrophages, target CD44-expressed cancer cells and, when loaded with the anticancer drug doxorubicin, effectively inhibit tumor growth. The innovation of this study lies in the engineering of PEG NPs that can circumvent the ABC phenomenon and that can be functionalized for the improved and targeted delivery of drugs."
"Assessing critical infrastructure resilience in terms of its service-providing capacity in coastal Bangladesh: A synthesis of geospatial techniques and social responses Bangladesh; Cyclonic Storms; Disaster Lack of adequate infrastructure, especially in the coastal regions of developing countries, limits the capacity of households to prevent, cope with, and recover from the adverse effects of natural hazards. The services provided by critical infrastructure (CI) contribute to the overall resilience of marginalized coastal households to natural hazards. CI, in turn, may itself be resilient (or not). Resilient CI is capable of providing services to meet the community's demand for that service. This research developed and tested an innovative framework for assessing CI resilience in terms of services it was capable to provide to coastal residents in three separate phases (before, during, and after) of Cyclone Sidr, using empirical evidence from a coastal sub-district of Bangladesh. The disaster-phase-wise level of demand for these services was identified using GIS-based network analysis combined with community rankings of service importance across the disaster phases. Households were surveyed to determine whether they were able to procure CI services in each phase. A comparison of service demand levels with success in procuring CI services was used to assess CI resilience. The results revealed spatio-temporal variation in the service provision of existing CI units to households in the study area. A mixed trend was indicated: less exposed communities contained a somewhat higher percentage of service-receiving households than more exposed communities during the pre- and post-disaster phases, whereas the percentage was higher in the more exposed communities during the syn-disaster phase. This approach has the potential to determine whether the existing CI in a community is resilient enough to support the population in the different phases of a cyclone. The results could guide planners to bolster CI resilience for communities, thereby also improving community resilience to natural hazards."
"Examining the commercially available hydrophobic membranes in combined desalination and power generation through permeate gap membrane distillation Distillation; Direct Contact; Membrane Developing robust and sustainable desalination processes with minimum energy consumption in integration with renewable energy sources is on high demand in the current climate. Utilizing membrane-based processes for either freshwater production or power generation has appeared as a promising approach in recent years. This research further examines the potential of utilizing a permeate gap membrane distillation (PGMD) system integrated with a sealed air tank to produce combined freshwater and power (CWP) on the laboratory scale. In this study, different commercial hydrophobic membranes with 0.2 to 0.02 Î¼m pore size ranges have been tested and the laminated membranes have been examined in two mounting orientations. The maximum harvested hydraulic pressure and power density by using a pristine 0.1 Î¼m nominal pore size laminated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane facing the active layer to the feed channel (ALF orientation), were measured at approximately 1.8 bar and 0.47 W/m2, respectively under the defined test condition. Mounting the active layer to the permeate side (ALP orientation), the maximum hydraulic pressure and power density recorded at approximately 3.6 bar and 0.42 W/m2, respectively. The experimental data using the 0.02 Î¼m pore size laminated hydrophobic PTFE membrane showed the same pattern. That is, despite producing higher hydraulic pressure with currently available commercial smaller pore size membrane in the ALP orientation, the generated power density has not increased significantly or may have even reduced. Hence, the development of high compressive resistance membranes with high permeability, low surface energy and narrow pore size distribution characteristics, is vital to be able to propose the CWP process using membrane distillation (MD) systems as a competitive and sustainable desalination technology."
"The social location of harm from others’ drinking in 10 societies Alcohol Consumption; Vodka; Ethanol Aims: Survey data from 10 diverse countries were used to analyse the social location of harms from othersâ€™ drinking: which segments of the population are more likely to be adversely affected by such harm, and how does this differ between societies?. Methods: General-population surveys in Australia, Chile, India, Laos, New Zealand, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United States and Vietnam, with a primary focus on the social location of the harmed person by gender, age groups, rural/urban residence and drinking status. Harms from known drinkers were analysed separately from harms from strangers. Results: In all sites, risky or moderate drinkers were more likely than abstainers to report harm from the drinking of known drinkers, with risky drinkers the most likely to report harm. This was also generally true for harm from strangersâ€™ drinking, although the patterns were more mixed in Vietnam and Thailand. Harm from strangersâ€™ drinking was more often reported by males, while gender disparity in harm from known drinkers varied between sites. Younger adults were more likely to experience harm both from known drinkers and from strangers in some, but not all, societies. Only a few sites showed significant urban/rural differences, with disparities varying in direction. In multivariate analyses, most relationships remained, although some were no longer significant. Conclusion: The social location of harms from othersâ€™ drinking, whether known or a stranger, varies considerably between societies. One near-commonality among the societies is that those who are themselves risky drinkers are more likely to suffer harm from othersâ€™ drinking."
"The role of environment clubs in promoting ecocentrism in secondary schools: student identity and relationship to the earth Deep Ecology; Sustainability; Anthropocentric This qualitative study used a deep ecology lens and the New Environmental Paradigm to investigate anthropocentrism and ecocentrism in 30 secondary school environment club students from three schools in Victoria, Australia. The work repositions the deep ecology philosophy as a posthumanist/relational ideology, providing novel perspectives based on kinship with the earth. Open-ended interviews assessed the alignment of attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors along a Deep Ecology Spectrum. Key aspects of deep ecology were confirmed through the study findings including biospherical egalitarianism, limits to growth, wildlife preservation, anti-consumerism, environmental activism, and ecological identity."
"Live-cell systems in real-time biomonitoring of water pollution: Practical considerations and future perspectives Genetic Procedures; Photorhabdus Luminescens; Whole Cell Continuous monitoring and early warning of potential water contamination with toxic chemicals is of paramount importance for human health and sustainable food production. During the last few decades there have been noteworthy advances in technologies for the automated sensing of physicochemical parameters of water. These do not translate well into online monitoring of chemical pollutants since most of them are either incapable of real-time detection or unable to detect impacts on biological organisms. As a result, biological early warning systems have been proposed to supplement conventional water quality test strategies. Such systems can continuously evaluate physiological parameters of suitable aquatic species and alert the user to the presence of toxicants. In this regard, single cellular organisms, such as bacteria, cyanobacteria, micro-algae and vertebrate cell lines, offer promising avenues for development of water biosensors. Historically, only a handful of systems utilising single-cell organisms have been deployed as established online water biomonitoring tools. Recent advances in recombinant microorganisms, cell immobilisation techniques, live-cell microarrays and microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip technologies open new avenues to develop miniaturised systems capable of detecting a broad range of water contaminants. In experimental settings, they have been shown as sensitive and rapid biosensors with capabilities to detect traces of contaminants. In this work, we critically review the recent advances and practical prospects of biological early warning systems based on live-cell biosensors. We demonstrate historical deployment successes, technological innovations, as well as current challenges for the broader deployment of live-cell biosensors in the monitoring of water quality."
"Critical evaluation of 'ageing in place' in redeveloped public rental housing estates in Hong Kong Residential Satisfaction; Public Housing; Nigeria The tremendous growth in the ageing population over the past two decades has compelled the Hong Kong government to reformulate its housing policy by redeveloping and incorporating certain age-friendly housing design elements and facilities into the public housing schemes built in the post-war period. This research investigates whether these introduced design elements and facilities satisfy the numerous special needs of the seniors in line with the concept of 'ageing in place'. Data were collected from 224 seniors through a comprehensive questionnaire survey in four large-scale redeveloped public rental housing estates. Using three designated built environment dimensions, namely micro, meso and macro, the results revealed that senior tenants were generally satisfied with the present living environments (in all the three scales) in the estates. At the micro-scale, seniors were satisfied with the level of privacy and sense of autonomy derived from the present design features in their homes. For the meso-scale, the study revealed that the seniors were particularly satisfied with the design elements such as convenient transportation and accessibility, including convenient walkways. At the macro-scale, the community care service is deemed important for seniors' wellbeing. However, more attention is needed on safety measures in interior and shower areas, public seating in common areas and provision of sufficient community care services. This study provides insights for policy makers and development authorities on elderly housing provision ."
"Gender crime convergence over twenty years: Evidence from Australia Property Crime Rate; Crime; Deterrence Historically men have been responsible for the majority of criminal activity and dominate prison populations around the globe. The twentieth century witnessed significant maleâ€“female convergence in a myriad of positive dimensions including human capital acquisition, labour force participation and wages. This has prompted the question, to what extent are women â€˜looking more like menâ€™? In this paper we examine whether similar forces are at play in the context of criminality. We study the pattern of gender convergence in crime using rich administrative data on the population of young people in Queensland, Australia. The evidence points to a significant narrowing of the gender gap in criminal activity over the course of the last twenty years. Crime convergence occurs for broad aggregates of both property and violent crime, as well as for almost all sub-component categories. Convergence occurs largely because crime has fallen significantly for men, combined with no downward trend for women. This is confirmed by aggregate analysis of rates of offending in police force districts matched to Census data by gender between 2001 and 2016."
"We have a steak in it: Eliciting interventions to reduce beef consumption and its impact on biodiversity Meat Consumption; Diet; Livestock Products Beef production is a major driver of biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions globally, and multiple studies recommend reducing beef production and consumption. Although there have been significant efforts from the biodiversity conservation sector toward reducing beef-production impacts, there has been comparatively much less engagement in reducing beef consumption. As a first step to address this gap and identify leverage points, we conducted a policy Delphi expert elicitation. We asked 16 multidisciplinary experts from research and practitioner backgrounds to propose interventions for reducing beef consumption in the United States. Experts generated and critiqued 20 interventions, creating a qualitative dataset that was thematically analyzed to allow the interventions to be prioritized. Effective, feasible interventions included changing perceived social norms, targeting food providers, and increasing the availability and quality of beef alternatives. This work introduces a conservation research agenda for reducing beef consumption and explores a structured process for prioritizing behavioral interventions."
"Narratives of internal migration experiences, health/well-being issues among females working as head-porters (Kayayei) in Ghana Health Coverage; User Fees; National Health Programs Purpose: This study aims to explore the internal migration experiences and health/well-being issues of 38 girls and women working as Kayayei (head-porters) in Accra, Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from seven focus group interview sessions, and thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings: The results revealed the geographic, structural and family issues that promote increased migration of females to the cities. The findings betray the potential negative effects of migration on the participantsâ€™ quality of life, including accessing health services. They also suggest that the Kayayei phenomenon is a significant child protection, health/well-being concern yet to be given adequate attention in ways that consider the implications of such large internal migration of females on the overall human resource development capacities of rural communities. Originality/value: This is an original study with data collected to explore internal rural to urban migration and its effect on health and well-being of young girls and women."
"Enhancing greywater treatment via MHz-Order surface acoustic waves Surface Acoustic Wave; Droplet; Interdigital Transducers There is a pressing need for efficient biological treatment systems for the removal of organic compounds in greywater given the rapid increase in household wastewater produced as a consequence of rapid urbanisation. Moreover, proper treatment of greywater allows its reuse that can significantly reduce the demand for freshwater supplies. Herein, we demonstrate the possibility of enhancing the removal efficiency of solid contaminants from greywater using MHz-order surface acoustic waves (SAWs). A key distinction of the use of these high frequency surface acoustic waves, compared to previous work on its lower frequency (kHz order) bulk ultrasound counterpart for wastewater treatment, is the absence of cavitation, which can inflict considerable damage on bacteria, thus limiting the intensity and duration, and hence the efficiency enhancement, associated with the acoustic exposure. In particular, we show that up to fivefold improvement in the removal efficiency can be obtained, primarily due to the ability of the acoustic pressure field in homogenizing and reducing the size of bacterial clusters in the sample, therefore providing a larger surface area that promotes greater bacteria digestion. Alternatively, the SAW exposure allows the reduction in the treatment duration to achieve a given level of removal efficiency, thus facilitating higher treatment rates and hence processing throughput. Given the low-cost of the miniature chipscale platform, these promising results highlight its possibility for portable greywater treatment for domestic use or for large-scale industrial wastewater processing through massive parallelization."
"Impact of microfinance on poverty and microenterprises Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion In this chapter, Awaworyi Churchill conducts a meta-analysis to review the impact of microfinance on poverty reduction and microenterprise performance. He considers four proxies for poverty and three for microenterprise performance in order to examine the empirical evidence and to provide a general conclusion on the impacts of microfinance, while addressing issues of within and between-study variations. The chapter reports evidence of some positive effect on poverty, but this effect is weak."
"CFD analysis of environmental impacts on a thermochromic smart window Vanadium Dioxide; Metal-Insulator Transition; Thin Films Thermochromic (TC) glazing is an advanced smart window technology that can help to achieve nearly zero-energy buildings. The glazing temperature that affects TC thermo-optical properties directly impacts its energy-saving performance. However, the impacts of solar radiation and natural convection occurring on this temperature-sensitive material are not yet fully understood. Compared to previous focuses on material properties and energy evaluation, this study aimed to provide a different view from thermo-fluid dynamics on the heat transfer characteristics of a TC window, with impacts of environmental factors addressed. A validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model identifies the environmental impacts on the TC glazing temperatures under the coupled radiative and convective heat transfer. Furthermore, a theoretical model was developed with an empirical factor obtained from CFD results. It enables a simple calculation to obtain the TC glazing's temperature by using solar factors, outdoor temperatures and optical properties. The model suggests that the temperature difference between the TC glazing and the ambient is a function of absorbed solar irradiation (âˆqÌ‡total0.75). The predictive model is then tested using typical climate conditions in three cities in China with different solar angles, which demonstrates good agreement with an average absolute error of 5% compared to simulated glazing temperature. This estimation method can further assist in material design, product selection and Building Energy Simulations to achieve a TC window design that is â€˜smartâ€™ on seasonal change requirements for different regions."
"Trust and fiduciary relationships in education: What happens when trust is breached? Academic Leadership; Education; Management Roles This paper examines trust as a fundamental aspect of fiduciary relationships in education. The specific relationship under examination is that of academic employee and university employer. Both have the value of trust assigned to them as an implicit part of their social and professional contract. The setting is Australia, but the principles apply to any democratic jurisdiction and educational level or location, where fiduciary principles are a pre-condition for healthy and trustworthy working relationships. The paper firstly discusses the meaning and application of â€˜trustâ€™ and â€˜fiduciaryâ€™, and considers the codes that regulate fiduciary relationships in education. It then asks what happens if and when the fiduciary duties and obligations are not upheld, advancing that question through an employment law case against an Australian university, for alleged breach of the Fair Work Act (Australia). The analysis shows what may be the outcome when fiduciary trust between employee and employer is breached, how it may happen, and the consequences of this. The aim of the paper is to throw light on the value of trust for robust working relationships in academic life. Ultimately, the paper shows that trust is axiomatic to a working system of justice in a healthy educational workplace."
"Bushfire evacuation decision support system use in incident management training Wildfires; Wildland-Urban Interface; Disaster In preparation for the 2021â€“22 summer bushfire season, approximately 60 emergency management specialists from 20 different emergency response and support agencies came together at the Geelong Incident Control Centre in an Incident Management Team (IMT) training exercise. The aim was to plan the response to a mock scenario bushfire threatening coastal townships and summer traffic on the Great Ocean Road within the Surf Coast Shire of Victoria. The scenario was set in realtime, and it tested the IMTâ€™s evacuation decision-making under pressure on a severe fire-danger day. When deciding on evacuation, an IMT Incident Controller considers impact and community preparedness and resourcing often within a limited timeframe in a rapidonset event. The Controller should only recommend evacuation when it is expected to offer better protection for the community than other options and can be achieved without endangering response agency personnel."
"The diffusion-adoption of accrual accounting in Sri Lankan local governments Accrual Accounting; International Public Sector Accounting Standards; Local Government The aim of this paper is to evaluate the diffusion-adoption of accrual accounting among Sri Lankan local governments. The paper draws on the Diffusion of Innovation theory to explain the factors that assist or mitigate the adoption of accrual accounting as a new accounting practice. Finance managers, charged with the responsibility of adopting accrual accounting, were influenced by two major factors: a centralised knowledge-diffusion process educating these finance managers about its compatibility; and its observability in practice to understand the benefits of adoption. The paper contributes to the understanding of the diffusion of accounting innovation in developing countries and the role of key players such as professional associations within this process."
"The Australian music industry’s mental health crisis: media narratives during the coronavirus pandemic Piano; Music Lessons; Psychological Practice How has the Australian music industryâ€™s mental health crisis played out in the media during the coronavirus pandemic? This commentary article considers a snapshot of media reports about this issue. We survey print and online media, press releases, official websites, online seminars and social media from March to June 2020. During this time, the industry has faced financial loss, job insecurity and anxiety for the future of Australian music, thus placing unprecedented strain on an industry already characterised by poor mental health. We identify four key narratives communicated by the media, which we call (1) acknowledging grief and loss, (2) supporting creativity and well-being, (3) adapting to the new normal and (4) envisaging a post-pandemic future. These narratives illustrate overarching concern for music industry workersâ€™ mental health and also the provision of helpful strategies for managing these issues."
"A parsimonious approach to mapping climate-change-related composite disaster risk at the local scale in coastal Bangladesh Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Climate-change-induced disaster risks impede sustainable development goals in many developing countries. With the prevailing climate change conditions, environmental events are likely to become even more pervasive. Coastal regions, the source of numerous tangible and intangible benefits for human populations, are exposed to a wide range of risks. With the motivation that knowledge of risk at local levels could bring substantial benefits for risk reduction planning, the current study devised a framework for mapping composite disaster risk at the local scale using context-specific risk variables and tested it within a clearly defined coastal sub-district of southwestern Bangladesh. Utilizing easily accessible spatial and non-spatial secondary datasets, a risk map for the study area was formulated using geospatial techniques. The map revealed that within a small area of about 230 km2, the disaster risk varied considerably, which is attributable to the variability of geographic and socio-demographic features of the area. The map delineated 21% of the study area as very high risk, 20% as high, 21% as moderate, 20% as low, and 18% as very low risk. The technique for risk mapping adopted in this study is inexpensive to conduct, doable within a brief period, requires limited data inputs and is thus useable for countries like Bangladesh that have a dearth of data. The resulting map is an improvement over existing risk maps, which are currently available only at the regional scale, and hence provides a robust platform upon which to commence the process of disaster risk reduction in the area."
"From nanoparticles to crystals: one-pot programmable biosynthesis of photothermal gold structures and their use for biomedical applications Silver Nanoparticles; Green Synthesis; Biofabrication Inspired by nature, green chemistry uses various biomolecules, such as proteins, as reducing agents to synthesize metallic nanostructures. This methodology provides an alternative route to conventional harsh synthetic processes, which include polluting chemicals. Tuning the resulting nanostructure properties, such as their size and shape, is challenging as the exact mechanism involved in their formation is still not well understood. This work reports a well-controlled method to program gold nanostructures' shape, size, and aggregation state using only one protein type, mucin, as a reduction and capping material in a one-pot bio-assisted reaction. Using mucin as a gold reduction template while varying its tertiary structure via the pH of the synthesis, we demonstrate that spherical, coral-shaped, and hexagonal gold crystals can be obtained and that the size can be tuned over three orders of magnitude. This is achieved by leveraging the protein's intrinsic reducing properties and pH-induced conformational changes. The systematic study of the reaction kinetics and growth steps developed here provides an understanding of the mechanism behind this phenomenon. We further show that the prepared gold nanostructures exhibit tunable photothermal properties that can be optimized for various hyperthermia-induced antibacterial applications."
"How much wind power potential does europe have? Examining european wind power potential with an enhanced socio-technical atlas Wind Farms; Wind Power; Social Rejection The continuous development of onshore wind farms is an important feature of the European transition towards an energy system powered by distributed renewables and low-carbon resources. This study assesses and simulates potential for future onshore wind turbine installations throughout Europe. The study depicts, via maps, all the national and regional socio-technical restrictions and regulations for wind project development using spatial analysis conducted through GIS. The inputs for the analyses were based on an original dataset compiled from satellites and public databases relating to electricity, planning, and other dimensions. Taking into consideration socio-technical constraints, which restricts 54% of the combined land area in Europe, the study reveals a nameplate capacity of 52.5 TW of untapped onshore wind power potential in Europe - equivalent to 1 MW per 16 European citizens â€“ a supply that would be sufficient to cover the global all-sector energy demand from now through to 2050. The study offers a more rigorous, multi-dimensional, and granular atlas of onshore wind energy development that can assist with future energy policy, research, and planning."
"Sedimentary and diagenetic facies of tidal flat in epeiric sea and its related descriptive method-a case of Ma51-4 submember in Jingbian gas field of Ordos basin, China Ordovician; China; Calcium Magnesium Carbonate The Ma51-4 submembers of Jingbian gas field in Ordos basin of China belongs to epeiric sea evaporative carbonate tidal flat facies. Supratidal zone of gypsum nodule dolostone and upper part of intertidal zone of gypsum crystal dolostone are most favorable reservoir. The carbonate rocks of Ma51-4 had undergone complex diagenesis. Penecontem-poraneous dolomitization and gypsification provided the material foundation of the reservoir. Epidiagenesis selective dissolution of gypseous dolostone constructs the origin shape of pore structure. The dissolution and filling of various minerals in the burial period determine whether the early dissolution pores can be preserved, and the final state of the reservoir. Burial dissolution and filling of various minerals determined the preservation of early dissolved pores and the final condition of the reservoir. The concept of â€œminus cement porosityâ€ directly reflects that sedimentary facies have great influence on the growth of reservoir in Ma51-4. Combined with sedimentary microfacies and diagenetic facies, a concise numerical symbol is used to express semiquantitatively sed-imentary microfacies and diagenesis facies. This descriptive method has great benefit in reservoir evaluation and prediction."
"Recycling Perspectives of Circular Business Models: A Review Industrial Symbiosis; Sustainable Development; Circular Economy The circular business model (CBM) is one of the main building blocks of circular economy (CE), and recycling is one of the main strategies for achieving it. CBM literature is currently evolving, and recycling-oriented discussion has been found in a scattered manner. This review article aims to identify critical components of the recycling-focused business model in CE and evaluate potential business and research opportunities in the area. Data collection was undertaken from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection and ScienceDirect database. Results of the study showed that efficiency of municipal solid waste management, reporting mechanism of recyclers cost of recycled materials, the establishment of a plastic hub, implementation of extended producer responsibility, strategic partnership, incentives, and product design were highlighted as critical requirements for efficient recycling operated business models, especially for waste solar PV panels, e-waste, textile waste, and vehicles and battery sector. It also identified the benefits of using recycled materials in reducing carbon footprint, energy consumption, and achieving low environmental impact. Three-dimensional printing, sensor-based RFID tags, digital twins, additive manufacturing, Industry 4.0, and the Internet of Things (IoT) were found as state-of-the-art technological innovations applied to recycling-oriented circular business models. This article provides critical practical solutions for new business model development and indicates vital future research directions along with a conceptual framework development, which would be helpful for policymakers, business entities, and research academics."
"Effect of energy per layer on the anisotropy of selective laser melted AlSi12 aluminium alloy Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) The anisotropy in the tensile properties of AlSi12 alloy fabricated using selective laser melting (SLM) additive manufacturing process was investigated. The tensile samples were printed in three different orientations, horizontal (H - 0Â°), inclined (I - 45Â°), and vertical (V - 90Â°), and found to exhibit yield strength between 225 MPa and 263 MPa, tensile strength between 260 MPa and 365 MPa, and ductility between 1 and 4%, showing distinct fracture patterns. It was established that the build orientation had insignificant effect on the microstructural characteristics of the SLM-printed samples, while XRD phase analysis showed variations in the Al (111) and Al (200) peak intensities. Consequently, the anisotropy in the mechanical properties of the SLM-printed AlSi12 samples was attributed to the differences in their relative density. Although the energy density was kept constant when printing the samples along different orientations, the â€œenergy per layerâ€ was found to be different owing to the variation in the printing area along the build direction. Further investigation on the effect of printing area, and correspondingly energy per layer, on the relative density was carried out. It was found that energy per layer in the range of 504â€“895 J yielded â‰¥99.8% relatively dense AlSi12 SLM-printed samples. This study puts forth a new idea that the density of the SLM-printed samples could be controlled using energy per layer as an input process parameter."
"Social practices and dynamic non-humans: Nature, materials and technologies Biopolitics; Governmentality; Disaster The robots are coming! So too is the 'age of automation', the march of 'invasive' species, more intense natural disasters, and a potential cataclysm of other unprecedented events and phenomena of which we do not yet know, and cannot predict. This book is concerned with how to account for these non-humans and their effects within theories of social practice. In particular, this provocative collection tackles contemporary debates about the roles, relations and agencies of constantly changing, disruptive, intelligent or otherwise 'dynamic' non-humans, such as weather, animals and automated devices. In doing so contributors challenge and take forward existing understandings of dynamic non-humans in theories of social practice by reconsidering their potential roles in everyday life. The book will benefit sociology, geography, science and technology studies, and human- (and animal-) computer interaction design scholars seeking to make sense of the complex entanglement of non-human phenomena and things in the performance of social practices."

"Interaction and Coupling Mechanism between Recessive Land Use Transition and Food Security: A Case Study of the Yellow River Basin in China Rural Settlements; Land Consolidation; China The Yellow River Basin (YRB) plays an important role in Chinaâ€™s socioeconomic development and ecological security. From the perspective of recessive land use transition (RLUT), exploring the watershed food security (FS) coordination mechanism is of strategic significance to territorial space optimization and high-quality development. To this end, a coordinated evaluation system was built for analyzing the coupling coordination degree (CCD), spatiotemporal evolution characteristics, and driving mechanism between RLUT and FS of 74 cities in the YRB from 2003 to 2018, using methods such as the coupling coordination degree model, spatial autocorrelation analysis, and the geo-detector model. The results are as follows: (1) Spatial imbalance of RLUT and FS in the YRB is significant. RLUT has significant differences between east and west, and FS has significant differences between north and south. (2) From 2003 to 2018, the CCD between RLUT and FS increased from 0.6028 to 0.6148, maintaining a steady upward trend, and the cold and hot characteristics of spatial agglomeration are significant. (3) The CCD between RLUT and FS depends on population density, average annual temperature, and average elevation. The driving effect of natural factors is higher than the socioeconomic factors on the total basin scale, but the opposite is true on the sub-basin scale. Clarifying the spatiotemporal pattern, characteristics, and mechanism of the coupling and the coordination of RLUT and FS can provide a scientific basis for territorial space planning."
"A smart mechatronic base isolation system using earthquake early warning Early Warning Systems; Earthquakes; Seismic In earthquake-prone countries such as Japan, effects of earthquakes are one of the major design objectives in buildings and infrastructures. Recent advances in earthquake engineering have improved the safety and reliability of buildings and infrastructures. Better understanding of geomorphology of earthquakes also enables us to better predict and estimate propagation of such natural hazard. For example, the Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system in Japan provides advanced warnings using the different arrival times of P and S waves. On the other hand, techniques and methods in passive, semi-active and active vibration control have flourished. Base-isolation is a proven technique which enhances earthquake resilience of buildings and bridges. In general, this technique involves decoupling a superstructure from its foundation and lengthens its natural period of vibration. This technique is mature and commercialization has taken place worldwide. However, wind-resistance of base-isolated structures is generally a concern as the lateral stiffness of a base-isolated structure is low and serviceability wind effects may induce unacceptable lateral movement and/or vibration of the structure. This paper presents a new concept which the base-isolation system is activated by EEW system through a mechatronic system. In other times the structure is not base-isolated and provides strong lateral resistance against wind loads. As a backup design, the proposed system also equips with its own network of accelerometers which can trigger base isolation system independent from EEW system. The smart mechatronic base isolation system is fully automated, and resets itself after each ground motion. The paper describes the conceptual framework of proposed system and presents laboratory-scaled proof-of-concept experiments. Four historical earthquake time histories were used as ground excitations. Structural responses are compared between the two triggering mechanisms and results are discussed. Finally, the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) which make use of EEW is discussed, allowing connectivity between a single control unit and a network of infrastructures to achieve economy of scale."
"It takes a family to lighten the load! The impact of family-to-business support on the stress and creativity of women micro-entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka Psychological Capital; Work Engagement; Personnel Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether family-to-business support acts as a job resource that attenuates the negative effects of work demands on the stress and creativity of women micro-entrepreneurs in the informal sector in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 359 women micro-entrepreneurs and their respective case officers in local government were used to test the hypothesized relationship between work demands and their creativity through the mediating mechanism of stress and the moderating effect of family-to-business support on the said relationship. Findings: Work demands reduced creativity through heightening the levels of stress faced by women micro-entrepreneurs. However, family-to-business support reduced the negative influence of work demands on creativity through stress. Practical implications: Women micro-entrepreneurs should build strong family ties to obtain support from family members. In addition, government training programs that target women micro-entrepreneurs should be extended to include their immediate family members. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature by examining whether family-to-business support buffers the negative effects of work demands for women micro-entrepreneurs in the informal sector. In doing so it makes a theoretical contribution by testing the key tenets of the JD-R model in entrepreneurial settings."
"Review of gas diffusion layer for proton exchange membrane-based technologies with a focus on unitised regenerative fuel cells Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC); Diffusion in Gases; Electrode Proton exchange membrane (PEM) based technologies (fuel cells and electrolysers) offer promising sustainable power generation and storage solutions for a diverse range of stationary and mobile applications. Unitised regenerative fuel cell (URFC) is an electrochemical cell that can operate both as a fuel cell (FC) and an electrolyser (E). However, for a widespread commercialisation, further improvements are required that address the durability, performance, and cost limitations. One of the main challenging components in developing URFCs is the gas diffusion layer (GDL) as it plays different vital roles, some of which are paradoxical in FC and E-modes. Therefore, in this paper, the published research on GDL of PEM-URFCs as well as relevant studies on PEM fuel cells and electrolysers are critically reviewed. The materials and novel methods to address the corrosion in E-mode are discussed. This is followed by presenting and discussing different properties of GDLs affecting the performance in FC and E-modes: i.e. porosity, thickness, pore size, transport properties, thermal and electrical conductivity, and the GDL compressibility. Finally, the main modifications of the GDLs, such as hydrophobisation and microporous layer application, to improve the performance of a URFC are analysed and discussed."
"Repetitive Predictive Control for Current Control of Grid-Connected Inverter under Distorted Voltage Conditions Inverters; Electric Current Control; Connected A repetitive predictive control for grid-connected inverter current control scheme is presented in this paper under voltage harmonic distortion in the stationary reference frame. Predictive control is an approach that uses a receding horizon to achieve the optimal track for the reference. In this approach, the repetitive controller behavior is added to the predictive control to increase its performance under distorted voltage conditions. In addition, to apply the controller in the generation system, controller is designed from the perspectives of the power system. The controller is designed considering the state-space model in the stationary reference frame. The controller performance was verified using a laboratory experimental setup under distorted grid voltage condition. Experimental results confirm that the proposed controller can effectively suppress harmonics under both normal operation and distorted grid voltage conditions, and also satisfy the requirements stipulated in IEEE Std. 1547.2-2008."
"Options for Improved Treatment of Saline Wastewater From Fish and Shellfish Processing Activated Sludge; Batch Reactors; Salinity The rapid growth of the aquaculture industry over recent decades, with annual production reaching 94.6 million tonnes in 2018 has resulted in a significant increase in saline wastewater following the use of seawater in both fish and shellfish production and processing. This wastewater contains high concentrations of nutrients, organic compounds, and total nitrogen, resulting in the requirement for significant treatment prior to discharge to meet environmental regulations, which are becoming more stringent. The infrastructure and running costs associated with physico-chemical treatment approaches are generally higher than the implementation of biological approaches; the latter represents both an economic and sustainable technology. However, salinity represents a significant inhibitor to microbial activity, affecting the efficacy of the biological treatment of wastewater. This review aims to 1) identify the major biodegradable components in saline fish wastewater that may result in deleterious effects upon discharge, 2) discuss the current methods used for the treatment of fish processing wastewaters, and 3) identify opportunities for improved processes to be utilised and identify gaps in knowledge that require further research. Total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total nitrogen (TN) were found to be the most prevalent components in fish effluent. High concentrations of TSS and TN are likely due to the protein content. One method for reducing the environmental impact of the treated wastewater is to enhance nutrient removal (TSS, TN, BOD) through process modification, leading to an increase in active proteolytic activity. Bioaugmentation using immobilised, saline-tolerant proteases or halophilic, protease-producing microorganisms have both shown significant potential in laboratory studies in reducing both the COD and TN content of fish processing wastewater to below discharge limits and therefore may represent commercial options for future treatment processes."
"Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design Urban Biodiversity; Urbanization; Birds Cities are increasingly considered important places for biodiversity conservation because they can harbor threatened species and because conservation in cities represents an opportunity to reconnect people with nature and the range of health and well-being benefits it provides. However, urbanization can be catastrophic for native species, and is a well-known threat to biodiversity worldwide. Urbanization impacts can be mitigated by urban design and development improvements, but take-up of these practices has been slow. There is an urgent need to incorporate existing ecological knowledge into a framework that can be used by planners and developers to ensure that biodiversity conservation is considered in decision-making processes. Here, we distill the urban biodiversity literature into five principles for biodiversity sensitive urban design (BSUD), ranging from creating habitat and promoting dispersal to facilitating community stewardship. We then present a framework for implementing BSUD aimed at delivering onsite benefits to biodiversity, and that is applicable across a range of urban development types and densities. We illustrate the application of the BSUD framework in two case studies focusing on the: (1) protection of an endangered vegetation remnant in a new low-density subdivision; and (2) persistence of an endangered reptile in an established suburban environment."
"Architectural modeling of transdisciplinary system with inherent social perspectives Hearing Aids; Very Elderly; Auditory Training In an earlier study, we had noted that the term transdisciplinary is used in describing a number of different situations but always implied some form of knowledge-sharing collaboration. Researchers have observed that the requisite knowledge lies both within a development team and outside of it, but how it all works in harmony may vary from case to case. In this paper, we explore the utility of a system architecture description standard, ISO 42010 as a framework for representing architectural knowledge in a consistent way. This is illustrated in a social innovation case study. The case also illustrates how knowledge from social, medical and physical sciences was combined at multiple levels within a telemedicine delivery system."
"Backlighting the European Indium Recycling Potentials Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals With increased understanding of the effects of human activities on the environment and added awareness of the increasing societal value of natural resources, researchers have begun to focus on the characterization of elemental cycles. Indium has captured significant attention due to the potential for supply shortages and nonexistent recycling at end of life. Such a combination of potentially critical features is magnified for countries that depend on imports of indium, notably many European countries. With the aims of analyzing the dynamics of material flows and of estimating the magnitude of secondary indium sources available for recycling, the anthropogenic indium cycle in Europe has been investigated by material flow analysis. The results showed that the region is a major consumer of finished goods containing indium, and the cumulative addition of indium in urban mines was estimated at about 500 tonnes of indium. We discuss these results from the perspective of closing the metal cycle in the region. Securing access to critical raw materials is a priority for Europe, but the preference for recycling metal urban mines risks to remain only theoretical for indium unless innovations in waste collection and processing unlock the development of technologies that are economically feasible and environmentally sustainable."
"Bodies of/at Work: How Women of Colour Experienced Their Workplaces and Have Been Expected to ‘Perform’ During the COVID-19 Pandemic Intersectionality; Feminism; Social Location Almost 50 years ago, Edward Said wrote on â€˜the otherâ€™ in relation to race and gender in his path-breaking book Orientalism (1978). While much has evolved around notions of gendered and racialised otherness since then, Saidâ€™s conceptualisation still resonates today. Our paper reports on a 2020/2021 survey of Women of Colour in the Australian workplace. The survey was conducted during the pandemic by Women of Colour Australia, a not-for-profit group, working with the lead author. We focus on the qualitative answers from participants, many of which detail sometimes painful and extremely personal workplace experiences. More than 500 Women of Colour, including seven per cent who were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, completed the survey. Sixty per cent said they had experienced discrimination in the workplace, despite 59 per cent of participants saying their workplace had a Diversity and Inclusion policy. Participants had to â€˜performâ€™ their identities whilst being subjected to intersectional issues of racism and sexism, some of which the pandemic exacerbated. Our paper describes the harmful ramifications of gendered othering of Women of Colour for Australian organisations and society in the years of the pandemic."
"The Production of Employment Conditions for Migrant Care Workers: Cross National Perspectives Long-Term Care; Carework; Personnel There is widespread scholarly recognition that migrant long-term care (LTC) workers experience relatively poorer work conditions than local LTC workers. We focus here on the ways in which migration and employment regulation intersect in formal LTC markets to produce working conditions for migrant workers. Drawing on cross-national comparisons between Australia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom we explore: firstly, the forms of employment regulation that can protect migrant LTC workers or expose them to additional risks; and secondly, how migration regulation can work to amplify employment protection gaps for certain groups of migrant workers. We find that while historically there have been better employment protections in Australia and the Netherlands, the reshaping of work in all three LTC systems creates a context within which migration regulation can exacerbate the risks of precarious work for migrant workers and for those on temporary visas in particular."
"Microplastics in an anadromous national fish, Hilsa shad Tenualosa ilisha from the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Hilsa shad is one of the most important fisheries, contributing about 12.9% of the country's (Bangladesh) total fish production. There was no previous study on microplastic contamination of this important commercial fish. This study aims to identify, classify, and quantify microplastics (MPs) ingested by the national fish of Bangladesh, Hilsa shad, Tenualosa ilisha. A total of 287 MPs were recovered from the gastrointestinal tracts. All the fishes analyzed were contaminated with MPs. The mean (Â±SD) of the number of MPs was 19.13 Â± 10.77 particles/fish, ranging from 7 to 51 particles/fish. Significant correlation was not found between the fish body length and MP abundance (rs = 0.287, p = 0.299), and between the fish body weight and MPs abundance (rs = 0.261, p = 0.347). The most dominant color was transparent (30%), followed by gray and black, contributing to 26% and 23%, respectively. The maximum number of MPs accounted for in the 300â€“1500 Î¼m size class where fiber was the most dominant (50%) shape of observed MPs. These results provide a baseline of MP contamination in seafood from Bangladesh that should be useful for future monitoring efforts. The present study is the first research on MP contamination of Hilsa shad."
"Use of bitumen encapsulated cigarette butts in stone mastic asphalt Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens Around the world, 75 percent of smokers do not dispose of their cigarette butts properly, thereby resulting in a large amount of mephitic waste cigarette butts (CBs) being dumped into the environment. Waste CBs take years to decompose with most containing a cellulose-acetate based filter, tar, nicotine, tobacco, and many highly toxic chemicals that leach into the soil and water bodies and cause contamination and toxicity. Mohajerani et al. in 2017 developed the encapsulation method for cigarette butts and investigated the incorporation of bitumen and wax encapsulated cigarette butts in dense asphalt concrete. This research work investigated the possible recycling of bitumen encapsulated CBs in stone mastic asphalt (SMA). Waste CBs were processed and encapsulated with bitumen class PMB A10E. Stone mastic asphalt samples were prepared by replacing coarse aggregates by 1%, 2%, and 3% (by weight) with bitumen encapsulated CBs. Marshall stability, flow, resilient modulus, and volumetric properties of SMA manufactured samples were investigated and the results were compared with those of the control SMA samples prepared without CBs. The experimental procedures and some of the significant outcomes of the study, along with some results from a leachate analysis have been presented and discussed. Average results show that the use of encapsulated CBs in Stone Mastic Asphalt samples manufactured in this study improved the stability and resistance to permanent deformation. Furthermore, the leaching of heavy metals from encapsulated CBs compared with those of unprocessed CBs reduced significantly. Based on the promising results found in this study, further investigations, and development of practical implementation procedures for recycling cigarette butts in asphalt concrete on an industrial scale are recommended."
"Caretakers' perceptions and willingness-to-pay for complementary food in urban and rural Cambodia Malnutrition; Child Nutrition Disorders; Stunting Inadequate child nutrition during the first â€˜1000 daysâ€™ is widespread in Cambodia, resulting in a high prevalence of child malnutrition. Access to processed complementary food in packages (PCFP) may support caretakers in improving diet of young children. This study aimed to evaluate the caretakers' preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for PCFP in Cambodia. The study was conducted in urban and rural settings, involving 520 caretakers with children aged 7â€“24 months in Phnom Penh (urban) and Prey Veng (rural). Four PCFPs were included: a commercial brand, a social-commercial brand, a worldwide distributed fortified complementary food aid product (CSB++) and an experimental fortified rice-and-fish-based PCFP developed in Cambodia (WF-L). Sensory analysis was conducted for all products, stated WTP was assessed for three products (excluding CSB++) and actual WTP experiment was conducted on WF-L only. Our results show that overall, WF-L was preferred by the rural participants over food aid CSB++. Further improvements in the organoleptic qualities of WF-L should focus on consistency and taste. The participants were, on average, willing to pay 1,667 Cambodian riel (KHR, $0.4) and 1,192 KHR ($0.3) in urban and rural settings, respectively, for 35 g of WF-L. We also found that despite being nutritionally inadequate, most participants considered homemade porridge to be healthier, more practical and preferred by the children. Therefore improving the quality of homemade foods merits urgent consideration. When applying PCFP in nutrition programmes as a supplementary option to homemade complementary foods, locally produced products could be a more viable supplementary option than global food aid."
"Editorial 18:3 celebrating women in higher education on international women’s day Century Treatise; Valverde; Quixote We have timed publishing our first standard issue of the year to coincide with International Womanâ€™s Day, 8 March 2021 to celebrate the contribution women have made to higher education. The first woman documented as teaching in a university was more than 800 years ago, and yet it is only the last century that the number of female academics has started to increase (Whaley, 2011). In Australia, the first university was established in 1851, yet it would be another 32 years until Julia Guerin graduated in 1883 from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in 1883 (Women's Museum of Australia, 2020). And another 10 years when Leonora Little graduated from Melbourne University with a Bachelor of Science in 1983. Despite these accomplishments in the late 19th century, it was not until 1959 when the first woman, Dorothy Hill, was awarded a Chair appointment (Chair of Geology) in an Australian university, and nearly a century before Australia has its first female Vice Chancellor, when Dianne Yerbury became the Vice-Chancellor of Macquarie University in 1987, a position she held for twenty years. Australiaâ€™s higher education history tells a clear story of the slow integration of women in higher education, particularly within the STEM fields. For example, Little graduated in 1893 with a Bachelor of Science, but it was 1928 before the first female Lecturer in Mathematics, Ethel Raybould was appointed, and another 36 years before Hanna Neumann became the first female Professor of Pure Mathematics in 1964. It was just over 60 years ago that Margaret Williams-Weir was the first female Indigenous Australian to graduate with a university qualification in 1959. Female Indigenous Australians remain under-represented in the Australian university graduate population. The current situation for Australian higher education still retains a dominance of males within academic roles, such as 30 percent more men in Associate and Full Professor roles than women (Devlin, 2021).

International Womanâ€™s Day is an opportunity to reflect on the significant contribution women make in higher education in Australia and globally. We celebrate through the publication of this issue, with many female authors from across higher education globally."
Reflection Measurement of Fire over Microwave Band: A Promising Active Method for Forest Fire Detection Fire Detection; Wildfires; Smoke This work presents a technique to detect forest fire using incoherent scattering of radio waves from the ionized electron cloud of combusting plant material. Superheated forest matter ionizes a certain amount of the Alkali salt in plants creating a natural plasma frequency. This work investigates this plasma using a calibrated transmission line to identify the electromagnetic plasma frequency of forest fire. A plasma frequency of approximately 500 MHz has been identified by burning 4 grams and 6 grams of dry Eucalypt leaves. The plasma frequency was found to be stable as long as the biomass density is constant.
"Catalytic degradation of methylene blue using iron and nitrogen-containing carbon dots as Fenton-like catalysts Fluorescence; Nanodots; Carbon Nanoparticles Wastewater pollution is an existing and serious environmental issue. One of the main wastewater pollution sources is from the dyestuff industries and its discharge poses a serious threat to the ecosystem due to its adverse effects on human and environmental health. Conventional wastewater treatments are limited in terms of effectively treating such non-biodegradable contaminants; thus, this work aimed to investigate the degradation of the commercial dye methylene blue (MB)viaadvanced oxidation processes (AOPs) using carbon dots as Fenton-like catalysts. Iron and nitrogen-containing carbon dots (Fe, N-CDs) were synthesised through a hydrothermal reaction and utilised as catalysts in the degradation of MB. Multiple characterisation techniques were employed to describe the dot properties including FTIR, XPS, TEM,Î¶-potential, PL and UV-Vis analyses. Characterisation revealed the synthesis of 7 nm diameter, spherical negatively charged dots rich in iron and nitrogen surface functionalities. Methylene blue was degraded under mild conditions using an innovative green remediation technology which removed nearly 100% of the dye (20 mg Lâˆ’1) under optimised conditions (at 50 Â°C, pH 8, H2O2147 mM, and a catalyst concentration of 0.5 mg mLâˆ’1) in only 60 minutes. The active mechanism of the Fe, N-CDs was deduced suggesting the participation of free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygens and holes. Importantly, the effluent toxicity assessed using MicrotoxÂ® confirmed the generation of a non-toxic effluent. This investigation showed that using Fe, N-CDs is an effective way to degrade wastewater pollution whilst significantly minimising its toxicity."
"Tertiary nutrient removal from wastewater by immobilised microalgae: Impact of wastewater nutrient characteristics and hydraulic retention time (HRT) Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Immobilising microalgal cells has been proposed as a process solution to overcome the barriers associated with the implementation of microalgae for wastewater remediation. This work evaluated the performance and remediation mechanisms of immobilised microalgae for continuous wastewater treatment under varying hydraulic retention times (HRT). Three domestic secondary wastewaters with differing concentrations of orthophosphate (PO4-P), ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N) were treated by Scenedesmus obliquus immobilised within 2% calcium alginate. Trials were run in continuous operation at HRTs of 3, 6, 12 and 20 h. Removal rates for PO4-P improved with increasing HRT, with minimum residual concentrations of 0.3â€“3.1 mgÂ·L-1 observed at 3 h and 0.01â€“0.2 mgÂ·L-1 at 20 h. Ammonium remediation was not linked to HRT or NH4+ concentration with minimum residual concentrations of,0.001 mgÂ·L-1. Reduction in NO3-N improved with increasing HRT, with minimum residual concentrations of â‰¤19.3 at 3 h and â‰¤0.4 mgÂ·L-1 at 20 h. Remediation was achieved through a combination of mechanisms including biological uptake and precipitation as a by-product of photosynthesis and nutrient metabolism. As such, immobilised microalgae have been proven to be an effective alternative solution for PO43- and NH4+ remediation of wastewater effluents at HRTs of 6â€“12 h."
"PROMIS® General Life Satisfaction scale: Construct validity in musculoskeletal pain patients Rasch Analysis; Rasch Model; Differential Item Functioning Background: Life satisfaction is part of subjective well-being. Measurement of life satisfaction is undertaken using self-report measures. This study aimed to evaluate the structural validity, concurrent validity, and internal structure of the PROMISÂ® General Life Satisfaction Scale (GLSS) in a musculoskeletal pain cohort. Method: Consecutive new patients attending the Victoria University Osteopathy Clinic (Melbourne, Australia) were invited to complete the GLSS prior to their initial consultation. Structural validity and internal structure were explored using confirmatory factor analysis and Mokken scale analysis. Concurrent validity was evaluated against a single-item measure of life satisfaction. Results: The PROMISÂ® GLSS comprised a single factor and formed an acceptable Mokken scale in this population. No differential item functioning was observed. A large positive correlation (r = 0.70) was observed between the General Life Satisfaction scale and a single-item measure of life satisfaction. Conclusions: The PROMISÂ® General Life Satisfaction scale demonstrated acceptable internal structure and structural validity in a musculoskeletal pain population. Additional research is required to explore concurrent validity and other measurement properties, however initial data suggests the measure could be a feasible screen of life satisfaction for Australian osteopathic patients."
"Informal Networks, Informal Institutions, and Social Exclusion in the Workplace: Insights from Subsidiaries of Multinational Corporations in Korea Guanxi; China; Managerial Ties Drawing on interviews with decision makers in multinational corporations (MNCs) in South Korea, we examine the role of informal networks in the social exclusion of women in the workforce. Although legislation in the country is in favor of gender equality, we found that informal barriers in the workplace remain difficult to overcome. Informal networks in Korea, yongo, present an ethical issue in the workplace, as they tend to socially exclude women, limiting possibilities for their participation and career progression. We found that informal networks are pervasive and strong because of the informal institutions in which they are embedded and that there is a complex interplay between informal networks and informal institutions that socially excludes women. Due to difficulties accessing yongo, women appear to build inmaek, a network type that is more open and accessible. We also found that MNCs in Korea can compensate for the lack of local informal networks for their female employees. However, despite providing a more supportive environment for women at work, gender equality policies in MNCs are not yet as effective as they could be due to the dynamics of the workplace and the fact that the policies are not tailored to the local context. We have seen evidence in recent years that MNCs can serve as role models for implementing gender equality policies by creating a more inclusive work environment and demonstrating leadership commitment and support."
"Gender crime convergence over twenty years: Evidence from Australia Property Crime Rate; Crime; Deterrence Historically men have been responsible for the majority of criminal activity and dominate prison populations around the globe. The twentieth century witnessed significant maleâ€“female convergence in a myriad of positive dimensions including human capital acquisition, labour force participation and wages. This has prompted the question, to what extent are women â€˜looking more like menâ€™? In this paper we examine whether similar forces are at play in the context of criminality. We study the pattern of gender convergence in crime using rich administrative data on the population of young people in Queensland, Australia. The evidence points to a significant narrowing of the gender gap in criminal activity over the course of the last twenty years. Crime convergence occurs for broad aggregates of both property and violent crime, as well as for almost all sub-component categories. Convergence occurs largely because crime has fallen significantly for men, combined with no downward trend for women. This is confirmed by aggregate analysis of rates of offending in police force districts matched to Census data by gender between 2001 and 2016."
"Open Forest: Data, Stories, and Walking-With Anthropocene; Climate Change; Environment Crisis Open Forest is a collective, experimental inquiry into different forests and more-than-human dataflows. The project explores how forests and forest data can be produced, thought of and engaged with otherwise, in co-creative ways that consider perspectives of diverse forest creatures and reach beyond geo-engineering, techno-solutionist perspectives. In this Situated Action, we build on our previous Open Forest activities organized in different parts of the world and take an experimental, hybrid walk in a local forest area in Newcastle followed by a co-creation of forest stories. Through these engagements, we hope to entangle the existing, mostly quantitative forests datasets with more messy and abstract data to question the currently available understandings about the forest as a resource to be used. Our aim is to support collective imagination and care-full sustainability actions towards flourishing more-than-human futures."
"Midkine: The Who, What, Where, and When of a Promising Neurotrophic Therapy for Perinatal Brain Injury Midkine; Pleiotrophin; Cytokines Midkine (MK) is a small secreted heparin-binding protein highly expressed during embryonic/fetal development which, through interactions with multiple cell surface receptors promotes growth through effects on cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. MK is upregulated in the adult central nervous system (CNS) after multiple types of experimental injury and has neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties. The potential for MK as a therapy for developmental brain injury is largely unknown. This review discusses what is known of MK's expression and actions in the developing brain, areas for future research, and the potential for using MK as a therapeutic agent to ameliorate the effects of brain damage caused by insults such as birth-related hypoxia and inflammation."
"Hierarchical routing protocols for wireless sensor network: a compressive survey Routing Protocols; Energy Efficient; Wireless Sensor Networks Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are one of the key enabling technologies for the internet of things (IoT). WSNs play a major role in data communications in applications such as home, health care, environmental monitoring, smart grids, and transportation. WSNs are used in IoT applications and should be secured and energy efficient in order to provide highly reliable data communications. Because of the constraints of energy, memory and computational power of the WSN nodes, clustering algorithms are considered as energy efficient approaches for resource-constrained WSNs. In this paper, we present a survey of the state-of-the-art routing techniques in WSNs. We first present the most relevant previous work in routing protocols surveys then highlight our contribution. Next, we outline the background, robustness criteria, and constraints of WSNs. This is followed by a survey of different WSN routing techniques. Routing techniques are generally classified as flat, hierarchical, and location-based routing. This survey focuses on the deep analysis of WSN hierarchical routing protocols. We further classify hierarchical protocols based on their routing techniques. We carefully choose the most relevant state-of-the-art protocols in order to compare and highlight the advantages, disadvantage and performance issues of each routing technique. Finally, we conclude this survey by presenting a comprehensive survey of the recent improvements of low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy routing protocols and a comparison of the different versions presented in the literature."

"Using corporate sustainability reporting to assess the environmental footprint of titanium and zirconium mining Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals The growing focus on environmental responsibility from the community, investors and regulators presents immense challenges and opportunities to mining companies. Titanium and zirconium minerals are vital, unrecyclable, and often irreplaceable components of modern infrastructure and technology. The companies which supply these minerals often have a long-history of sustainability reporting. Such reports have been used here to analyse energy usage, carbon dioxide emissions and water usage from mining and processing these minerals. Mining operations and titanium-slag producers in Australia, Canada, China, Mozambique, Madagascar, Norway, and South Africa were analysed. This paper presents both site-specific data as well as data generalized to heavy mineral sand (HMS) deposits vs igneous hard-rock style deposits, as well as those products which have undergone beneficiation. In terms of averages, energy use was higher for HMS (yearly average of between 0.90 â€“ 2.95 GJ/t valuable heavy mineral (VHM)) compared to ilmenite-dominant hard-rock mining (yearly average of between 0.21 â€“ 0.49 GJ/t ilmenite) and Ti-slag production required between âˆ¼10 â€“ 14 GJ/t of saleable product (including titanium slag and pig-iron). Emissions from ilmenite-dominant hard rock mining produced âˆ¼0.01 t CO2e/t ilmenite concentrate while HMS mining produced 0.07-0.38 t CO2e/t of VHM; emissions from beneficiating ilmenite into Ti-slag add significantly to this (0.62-1.21 t CO2e/t of saleable product, weighted by value). Overall, hard-rock mining operations consumed <5 kL/t ilmenite concentrate while HMS consumed 10-26 kL/t VHM. On the other hand, beneficiating hard-rock ilmenite into slag increases water-use by âˆ¼220 kL/t of saleable product. Finally, in terms of land use, it was determined that an average of 4.3 ha per 1 Mt of ore was disturbed in HMS operations (no data was available for hard-rock operations). While average results comparing HMS, hard-rock and beneficiated products were broadly comparable to existing LCA literature, data used in LCA literature is not consistent with specific sites and using generalized data to infer site-specific data will often lead to erroneous estimates. These observations taken together are particularly important to downstream purchasers, as well as the investment community who do not fund entire industries, but fund and back specific projects; the decision made on which site or company to invest in is increasingly determined by environmental, social and governance (ESG) related factors. This paper not only provides quantitative indications of these factors for Ti/Zr production, but also guidance for improving sustainability reporting in the industry. An improvement in the quality, quantity and consistency in this data, as this paper explains, will allow for greater information to guide investment and ESG outcomes for Ti/Zr industries."
"Toward sustainable environmental quality: Identifying priority research questions for Latin America PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs The Global Horizon Scanning Project (GHSP) is an innovative initiative that aims to identify important global environmental quality research needs. Here we report 20 key research questions from Latin America (LA). Members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) LA and other scientists from LA were asked to submit research questions that would represent priority needs to address in the region. One hundred questions were received, then partitioned among categories, examined, and some rearranged during a workshop in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Twenty priority research questions were subsequently identified. These research questions included developing, improving, and harmonizing across LA countries methods for 1) identifying contaminants and degradation products in complex matrices (including biota); 2) advancing prediction of contaminant risks and effects in ecosystems, addressing lab-to-field extrapolation challenges, and understanding complexities of multiple stressors (including chemicals and climate change); and 3) improving management and regulatory tools toward achieving sustainable development. Whereas environmental contaminants frequently identified in these key questions were pesticides, pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors or modulators, plastics, and nanomaterials, commonly identified environmental challenges were related to agriculture, urban effluents, solid wastes, pulp and paper mills, and natural extraction activities. Several interesting research topics included assessing and preventing pollution impacts on conservation protected areas, integrating environment and health assessments, and developing strategies for identification, substitution, and design of less hazardous chemicals (e.g., green chemistry). Finally, a recurrent research need included developing an understanding of differential sensitivity of regional species and ecosystems to environmental contaminants and other stressors. Addressing these critical questions will support development of long-term strategic research efforts to advance more sustainable environmental quality and protect public health and the environment in LA.

"Microfinance Institution Performance: Does the Macroeconomy Matter? Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion The performance of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) has been compared at various levels for the purpose of replications and policy formulations. However, the potential effects of the macroeconomy on MFI performance are often not considered. We propose that understanding the possible effects of country-level factors on MFI performance can help provide a more accurate evaluation and explain where microfinance fits in the development process. Based on data collected on 1544 MFIs, merged with country-level macroeconomic and macro-institutional data, we examine the effects of the macroeconomy on MFI performance. The results suggest that high economic growth is associated with better MFI performance. However, other modes of economic development, including wage employment opportunities, appear to impede MFI financial performance."
"‘He who pays the piper calls the tune’: university key performance indicators post COVID-19 Ranking; Journal Ranking; AACSB This paper is analytical and primarily focuses at the individual academic level. It examines the drive for academics to meet narrowly defined key performance indicators that is potentially leading to sub-optimal outcomes such as universities diverging from acting for the wider betterment of society and reduced quality of teaching and learning. This trend has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis. For example, a heavy reliance on online learning has potentially reduced student engagement where these programmes have not been designed and implemented well. If academic performance is primarily judged by research outcomes, but academics face increasing expectations around developing high-level, online teaching materials, then this creates a tension for them. Turning to the ways forward, universities need to develop staff performance evaluation systems that re-orientate towards a broader set of indicators of success, and academics need more input into the performance indicators that are cascaded down to them."
"Fast and accurate pneumocystis pneumonia diagnosis in human samples using a label-free plasmonic biosensor Pneumocystis Pneumonia; Cotrimoxazole; Prophylaxis Pneumocystis jirovecii is a fungus responsible for human Pneumocystis pneumonia, one of the most severe infections encountered in immunodepressed individuals. The diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia continues to be challenging due to the absence of specific symptoms in infected patients. Moreover, the standard diagnostic method employed for its diagnosis involves mainly PCR-based techniques, which besides being highly specific and sensitive, require specialized personnel and equipment and are time-consuming. Our aim is to demonstrate an optical biosensor methodology based on surface plasmon resonance to perform such diagnostics in an efficient and decentralized scheme. The biosensor methodology employs poly-purine reverse-Hoogsteen hairpin probes for the detection of the mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mtLSU rRNA) gene, related to P. jirovecii detection. The biosensor device performs a real-time and label-free identification of the mtLSU rRNA gene with excellent selectivity and reproducibility, achieving limits of detection of around 2.11 nM. A preliminary evaluation of clinical samples showed rapid, label-free and specific identification of P. jirovecii in human lung fluids such as bronchoalveolar lavages or nasopharyngeal aspirates. These results offer a door for the future deployment of a sensitive diagnostic tool for fast, direct and selective detection of Pneumocystis pneumonia disease."
"Weekend and weekday associations between the residential built environment and physical activity: Findings from the ENABLE London study Report Cards; Mode Choice; Built Environment Background We assessed whether the residential built environment was associated with physical activity (PA) differently on weekdays and weekends, and contributed to socio-economic differences in PA. Methods Measures of PA and walkability, park proximity and public transport accessibility were derived for baseline participants (n = 1,064) of the Examining Neighbourhood Activities in Built Living Environments in London (ENABLE London) Study. Multilevel-linear-regressions examined associations between weekend and weekday steps and Moderate to Vigorous PA (MVPA), residential built environment factors, and housing tenure status as a proxy for socio-economic position. Results A one-unit decrease in walkability was associated with 135 (95% CI [28; 242]) fewer steps and 1.2 (95% CI [0.3; 2.1]) fewer minutes of MVPA on weekend days, compared with little difference in steps and minutes of MVPA observed on weekdays. A 1km-increase in distance to the nearest local park was associated with 597 (95% CI [161; 1032]) more steps and 4.7 (95% CI [1.2; 8.2]) more minutes of MVPA on weekend days; 84 fewer steps (95% CI [-253;420]) and 0.3 fewer minutes of MVPA (95%CI [-2.3, 3.0]) on weekdays. Lower public transport accessibility was associated with increased steps on a weekday (767 steps, 95%CI [â€“13,1546]) compared with fewer steps on weekend days (608 fewer steps, 95% CI [â€“44, 1658]). None of the associations between built environment factors and PA on either weekend or weekdays were modified by socio-economic status. However, socio-economic differences in PA related moderately to socio-economic disparities in PA-promoting features of the residential neighbourhood. Conclusions The residential built environment is associated with PA differently at weekends and on weekdays, and contributes moderately to socio-economic differences in PA."
"Contaminants of Emerging Concern as novel groundwater tracers for delineating wastewater impacts in urban and peri-urban areas PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs Management and treatment of environmental impacts from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a major, worldwide, sustainability challenge. One issue associated with WWTP operation is the potential for groundwater contamination via leaking or infiltration of wastewater, particularly with inorganic nutrients (ammonia and nitrate) as well as persistent organic compounds. Despite the potential for such contamination to create environmental and health risks, conventional methods, such as the assessment of major ions, nutrients, bacteriological indicators and conventional tracers (such as stable and radiogenic isotopes) are often unable to provide accurate delineation of multiple potential sources of contamination. This is particularly important for WWTPs which often occur in urban, peri-urban or intensively farmed agricultural areas where multiple potential sources (such as livestock, fertilisers, wastewater irrigation, and domestic septic systems) may contribute similar contaminants. This review explores the applicability of promising novel groundwater tracers, such as Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) and isotopic tracers, which can be used in conjunction with conventional tracers (i.e. â€˜co-tracersâ€™) to provide a more definitive assessment of contaminant sources, plume delineation and even (potentially) indicating the age of contamination (e.g., recent vs. legacy). The suitability of the novel groundwater tracers is evaluated according to four key criteria: (i). sufficient presence in raw wastewater and/or treated effluents; (ii) diagnostic of WWTP impacts as opposed to other potential off-site contamination sources; (iii) persistence in the subsurface environment; and (iv) amenable to rapid and sensitive analysis. Further analysis of various classes of CECs along with improved detection limits associated with improvements in analytical methodologies should allow for future application of promising groundwater tracers, providing WWTP operators and regulatory authorities a more definitive toolbox with which to assess groundwater contamination associated with site operations. These include: persistent pharmaceuticals and personal care products (carbamazepine, crotamiton, primidone, atenolol and sulfamethoxazole), artificial sweeteners (acesulfame, sucralose, saccharin and cyclamate) and potentially, certain pesticides (atrazine and simazine)."
"Unconditional cash transfers, child labour and education: theory and evidence Child Labor; Family Characteristic; School Attendance We examine the impact of unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) on child labour and educational outcomes. We first develop a simple theoretical model where we explore how government transfers financed by labour income taxation affect household decisions on child labour and education. We then empirically examine the impact of Pakistan's Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), which is the largest cash transfer program in South Asia, on child labour and school outcomes. We employ a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to estimate the average effect of the UCTs on child labour and school outcomes, and find that UCTs have a positive and statistically significant impact on school enrolment and grade promotion, but no impact on school dropout rates in the short run. The BISP policy intervention increases grade promotion amongst boys but not amongst girls. In the short run, the BISP substantially reduces dropout for boys but increases substantially for girls. With regards to child labour, we find that the BISP policy intervention has no impact on child labour in the short run; but in the medium to long run, cash transfers help to reduce child labour amongst boys as well as girls. In the short run, however, the BISP increases child labour amongst girls but not boys. These findings are largely consistent with our theoretical predictions and also robust to a series of robustness and sensitivity checks."
"Recent trends and challenges of algal biofuel conversion technologies Biofuel; Nannochloropsis; Chlorella Sorokiniana The rapid growth in global energy demands has triggered the scientific community to explore new stepwise biofuel conversion approaches. Biofuels are considered as one of the most promising renewable alternatives to meet the global energy crisis and environmental concerns. Microalgae biomass has proven the potentiality for the production of biofuels, chemicals, and bio-based products leading to the transition from petroleum-based economy to a bio-based economy. Algal biofuel offers a number of advantages, for example, higher growth rate with no competition with food and minimal or no environmental impacts. Biofuel produced from microalgae has low viscosity and low density with high caloric value compared to cellulosic biofuel, which makes algal biofuel more suitable for the application. This chapter outlines the progress on the biofuels production from algal biomass. The process description of possible algal biofuel routes underlining the challenges associated with large-scale production have been detailed in this chapter."
"Achieving the promise of integration in social-ecological research: A review and prospectus Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework An integrated understanding of both social and ecological aspects of environmental issues is essential to address pressing sustainability challenges. An integrated social-ecological systems perspective is purported to provide a better understanding of the complex relationships between humans and nature. Despite a threefold increase in the amount of social-ecological research published between 2010 and 2015, it is unclear whether these approaches have been truly integrative. We conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the conceptual, methodological, disciplinary, and functional aspects of social-ecological integration. In general, we found that overall integration is still lacking in social-ecological research. Some social variables deemed important for addressing sustainability challenges are underrepresented in social-ecological studies, e.g., culture, politics, and power. Disciplines such as ecology, urban studies, and geography are better integrated than others, e.g., sociology, biology, and public administration. In addition to ecology and urban studies, biodiversity conservation plays a key brokerage role in integrating other disciplines into social-ecological research. Studies founded on systems theory have the highest rates of integration. Highly integrative studies combine different types of tools, involve stakeholders at appropriate stages, and tend to deliver practical recommendations. Better social-ecological integration must underpin sustainability science. To achieve this potential, future social-ecological research will require greater attention to the following: the interdisciplinary composition of project teams, strategic stakeholder involvement, application of multiple tools, incorporation of both social and ecological variables, consideration of bidirectional relationships between variables, and identification of implications and articulation of clear policy recommendations."
"Being ""Red"" on the internet: The craft of popularity on Chinese social media platforms Karl Marx; Economics; Capitalism While in common English-language parlance speaking of ""online celebrities"" encourages the conflation of new forms of famousness with existing discourses on mass media stardom and fandom, the Mandarin Chinese term wanghong, a shorthand term for wangluo hongren (literally ""person popular on the internet""), frames the enticing shores of online celebrity through the peculiar lexical domain of a grassroots popularity. The figure of the wanghong has in recent years accompanied the development of social media platforms in China, becoming a profitable profession, an inspirational role model, a morally condemnable by-product of internet economies, and in general a widely debated social phenomenon among local users. Drawing on interviews with more and less successful local online celebrities and discussions with their audiences, this chapter offers an up-to-date portrayal of the various forms of wanghong currently vying for attention on Chinese social media platforms, illustrating how popularity is crafted along with narratives of professionalism and economic aspirations intimately connected to the sociotechnical contexts of contemporary China."
"Techno-economic Evaluation of a 29-kW Micro-grid Hybrid Photovoltaic System for a Healthcare Center in Bangladesh Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems A micro-grid solar hybrid photovoltaic (PV) system has been designed for powering the remote healthcare center located at Charbhadrashan Upazila, Faridpur district in Bangladesh. Geographically, Bangladesh is a promising country for PV technologies, having an average of 4.5 kWh/m2/d solar insolation. The selected location for the work is an island into the mighty Padma River where the electric connection is not reliable for 24 hours service of a hospital. The considered roof-top PV system is comprised of 350 W solar panels, bi-directional inverter, generator, connecting wires, mounting system, and related accessories. In this assessment, state-of-the-art PV design software, HOMER Powering Health Tool has been utilized for estimating the load requirements, techno-economic and environmental evaluation of the micro-grid system. The load analysis revealed that a 29-kW grid-connected solar PV system is required for the hospital and the estimated net present cost (NPC) is US$29, 846, with a Levelized cost of energy is $0.045. Renewable electricity contributed 98% of this system's power requirement and the grid contributed only 2%. The annual production of this 25-year PV system is 43, 642 kWh/year and per unit, the electricity production cost is $0.058 which is significantly lower than today's average per-unit cost of $0.082 in Bangladesh. Besides, the system reduces 34.9 tons of CO2 emissions per year. Thus, this analysis suggested that the grid-connected PV system is a better configuration among other power sources for providing electricity to the health clinics in the absence of no electricity."
"Nurturing a Climate of Innovation in a Didactic Educational System: A Case Study Exploring Leadership in Private Schools in Turkey Psychological Practice; School Improvement; Professional Learning Major economic, social, and technological changes in the twenty-first century require a transformation in the everyday practices that educational institutions use to train future innovators. Through a case study on five schools within a network of private schools in Istanbul, Turkey, we explore how school principals and teachers nurture an innovation climate in their schools. Using methodological triangulation that combines semi-structured interviews, participant observation, interactive training sessions, and archival data, we identify four leadership practices that shape a climate conducive to innovation in these schools: a) fostering the creativity of the members of school society or community, b) developing a collaborative learning ecosystem, c) encouraging innovative teaching through online collaborative learning spaces and ICT, and d) empowering teachers to generate an adaptable curriculum in a flexible work environment. Findings indicate the significance of building a collaborative ecosystem that enables a separation or departure from the mainstream traditional and test-oriented education system in Turkey, which in turn inspires the creativity of teachers and students in the fabric of daily school life."
"Ultrasonic microencapsulation of oil-soluble vitamins by hen egg white and green tea for fortification of food Drug Delivery Systems; Targeted Drug Delivery; Microcapsule We report the microencapsulation of oil soluble vitamins (A, D and E) using a one pot ultrasonic process and raw egg white proteins as a shell material. Green tea catechin/iron complex coating method was further developed to impart UV filtering property to the microcapsules in order to protect the encapsulated nutrients from photodegradation. The microcapsules showed antibacterial properties and long shelf-life. The encapsulated vitamins were protected from degradation upon heating, UV irradiation, simulated storage/transit and cooking processes. The in-vitro digestion study showed that functional vitamin D can be potentially released in the gastrointestinal tract improving vitamin D availability by more than 2-fold compared to the free vitamin. The vitamin D microcapsules were highly stable and maintained their microstructures once incorporated into staple food products. The low-cost egg white shell encapsulated vitamins can improve the nutritional value of staple food products to combat maternal and child malnutrition."
"Porous Eleocharis@MnPE Layered Hybrid for Synergistic Adsorption and Catalytic Biodegradation of Toxic Azo Dyes from Industrial Wastewater Fluorescence; Nanodots; Carbon Nanoparticles The effective treatment of industrial wastewater to protect freshwater reserves for the survival of life is a primary focus of current research. Herein, a multicomponent Eleocharis-manganese peroxidase enzyme (Eleocharis@MnPE) layered hybrid with high surface area (1200 m 2 /m 3 ), with a strong synergistic adsorption and catalytic biodegradation (SACB), has been developed through a facile method. A combination of outer porous (Eleocharis) and inner catalytically active (MnPE) components of the hybrid resulted in highly efficient SACB system, evidenced by high removal rate of 15 kg m -3 day -1 (100%) and complete degradation of toxic Orange II (OR) azo dye into nontoxic products (gases and weak acids). The Eleocharis@MnPE layered hybrid efficiently degraded both OR in synthetic wastewater and also other azo dyes (red, pink, and yellow dyes) present in three different textile industrial effluents. For the industrial effluents, these were evidenced by the color disappearance and reduction in biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC) of up to 97%, 92%, and 76%, respectively. Furthermore, reduced toxicity of treated wastewater was confirmed by decreased cell toxicity to 0.1%-1% and increased cell viability to 90%. We believe that designing a hybrid system with strong ability of SACB could be highly effective for industrial-scale treatment of wastewater."
"Biodiversity conservation cannot afford COVID-19 communication bungles Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Climate Change; Skepticism With COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) dominating headlines, highlighting links between the pandemic and biodiversity may increase public awareness of the biodiversity crisis. However, ill-considered messages that frame nature as the problem rather than the solution could inadvertently propagate problematic narratives and undermine motivations and individual self-efficacy to conserve nature."
"Performance Evaluation of Lane Detection and Tracking Algorithm Based on Learning-Based Approach for Autonomous Vehicle Camera; Vanishing Point; Driver Assistance Disruptive technology, especially autonomous vehicles, is predicted to provide higher safety and reduce road traffic emissions. Lane detection and tracking are critical building blocks for developing autonomous or intelligent vehicles. This study presents a lane detecting algorithm for autonomous vehicles on different road pavements (structured and unstructured roads) to overcome challenges such as the low detection accuracy of lane detection and tracking. First, datasets for performance evaluation were created using an interpolation method. Second, a learning-based approach was used to create an algorithm using the steering angle, yaw angle, and sideslip angle as inputs for the adaptive controller. Finally, simulation tests for the lane recognition method were carried out by utilising a road driving video in Melbourne, Australia, and the BDD100K dataset created by the Berkeley DeepDrive Industrial Consortium. The mean detection accuracy ranges from 97% to 99%, and the detection time ranges from 20 to 22 ms under various road conditions with our proposed algorithm. This lane detection algorithm outperformed conventional techniques in terms of accuracy and processing time, as well as efficiency in lane detection and overcoming road interferences. The proposed algorithm will contribute to advancing the lane detection and tracking of intelligent-vehicle driving assistance and help further improve intelligent vehicle driving safety."
"‘Relatable’ as the Epitome of Praise?: Sonya Hartnett Transforms Readers Multiliteracies; Literacy Practices; Education Abstract: At a university in Melbourne, Australia, first-year preservice teachers were surveyed about their reading behaviours and attitudes. Many declared their dislike and disengagement from reading while simultaneously expressing the importance of successful reading for their future students. For these preservice teachers, the most important factor in their enjoyment was identified as being able to relate to what they were reading. If the texts were not immediately relatable then there was little incentive to keep reading. Their teacher-educators are passionate readers who believe that deep, nuanced reading is a prerequisite of reading pleasure and that reading fosters empathy and broadens human experience. It is incumbent on these teacher-educators to provide opportunities for preservice teachers to experience the effects of insightful reading on their literary and human understandings so that this, in turn, might inform and inspire similar classroom encounters for their young readers. Close readings of selected works by an award-winning Australian writer for young people demonstrate how such readings can be facilitated."
"Defining pathways to healthy sustainable urban development Greenspace; Green Infrastructure; National Parks Goals and pathways to achieve sustainable urban development have multiple interlinkages with human health and wellbeing. However, these interlinkages have not been examined in depth in recent discussions on urban sustainability and global urban science. This paper fills that gap by elaborating in detail the multiple links between urban sustainability and human health and by mapping research gaps at the interface of health and urban sustainability sciences. As researchers from a broad range of disciplines, we aimed to: 1) define the process of urbanization, highlighting distinctions from related concepts to support improved conceptual rigour in health research; 2) review the evidence linking health with urbanization, urbanicity, and cities and identify cross-cutting issues; and 3) highlight new research approaches needed to study complex urban systems and their links with health. This novel, comprehensive knowledge synthesis addresses issue of interest across multiple disciplines. Our review of concepts of urban development should be of particular value to researchers and practitioners in the health sciences, while our review of the links between urban environments and health should be of particular interest to those outside of public health. We identify specific actions to promote health through sustainable urban development that leaves no one behind, including: integrated planning; evidence-informed policy-making; and monitoring the implementation of policies. We also highlight the critical role of effective governance and equity-driven planning in progress towards sustainable, healthy, and just urban development."
"Low-energy housing as a means of improved social housing: Benefits, challenges and opportunities Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Rising energy costs are significantly impacting low-income households. These households can struggle to pay their utility bills, and/or self-ration how much energy they consume which impacts on liveability within the home, such as the provision of appropriate thermal comfort. While incremental progress is being made in terms of improving the energy efficiency of housing in many developed countries, such improvements are typically inaccessible to low-income or social housing tenants. This chapter presents outcomes of a multi-year evaluation of a cohort of low-energy social housing from Horsham in regional Victoria, Australia. The analysis includes technical performance data and is supplemented with the occupantsâ€™ own stories about improved liveability outcomes. It is clear that the evidence supports aspirations by the state housing agency, which owns and maintains the housing, to move beyond their current minimum housing standards for new construction. A combination approach, whereby the thermal performance of the dwelling is improved, in addition to including renewable energy generation, will address several goals of social (or public) housing providersâ€”namely improving quality of life, health outcomes, finances and poverty. In addition, such housing will help them achieve organisational or broader government sustainability goals such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel energy consumption."
"Connecting survivors to therapeutic support and criminal justice through informal reporting options: an analysis of sexual violence reports made to a digital reporting tool in Australia Sexual Assault; Rape; Victims This article analyses the content of 483 reports of sexual violence, including rape, sexual assault, child sexual abuse and various forms of sexual harassment, made to a digital reporting tool (DRT) developed by a rape crisis centre in Melbourne, Australia. These written digital reports were made in a confidential and informal capacity, with all de-identified reports distributed to relevant policing jurisdictions to support intelligence gathering. Based on an analysis of the de-identified reports, this article suggests the DRT functioned as an important gateway in connecting survivors with appropriate therapeutic support when disclosing sexual violence and had a demonstrable capacity to provide the police with information for intelligence gathering. There was also scope for survivors to make formal reports should they wish to do so. However, further research with police, sexual violence support services and survivors is needed to develop a full understanding of the potential of informal sexual violence reporting options."
"Transforming local climate adaptation organization: Barriers and progress in 13 swedish municipalities Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Local strategies and policies are key in climate adaptation, although research shows significant barriers to progress. Sweden, often seen as progressive in climate change issues, has struggled in adopting a sufficient local climate adaptation organization. This article aimed to describe and analyze the climate adaptation organization in 13 Swedish municipalities from five perspectives: Problem framing, administrative and political agency, administrative and political structures, measures and solutions, and the role of learning. The mapping of these perspectives provides an opportunity to analyze barriers to local climate adaptation. Key policy documents have been studied including climate adaptation plans, crisis management plans, and regulatory documents, as well as documents from private consultants. This study showed that few municipalities have a formal organization for climate adaptation, clear structures, political support, and specific climate adaptation plans. At the same time, many of the municipalities are planning for transformation, due to a push from the county board, a lead agency in climate adaptation. There are also ample networks providing opportunities for learning among municipalities and regions. This study concluded that one key barrier is the lack of focus and prioritization in a majority of the municipalities, leaving the administrators, often planners, in a more activist position. The need for organizational mainstreaming and resources is emphasized."
"Beyond monetary benefits of restoring sight in Vietnam: Evaluating well-being gains from cataract surgery Cataract Surgery; Blindness; Presbyopia A more holistic understanding of the benefits of sight-restoring cataract surgery requires a focus that goes beyond income and employment, to include a wider array of well-being measures. The objective of this study is to examine the monetary and non-monetary benefits of cataract surgery on both patients as well as their caregivers in Vietnam. Participants were randomly recruited from a Ho-Chi-Minh City Hospital. A total of 82 cataract patients and 83 caregivers participated in the survey conducted for this study. Paired t-tests, Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests, and regression analysis are used to detect any statistically significant differences in various measures of well-being for patients and caregivers before and after surgery. There are statistically significant improvements in monetary and non-monetary measures of well-being for both patients and caregivers approximately three months after undergoing cataract surgery, compared with baseline assessments collected prior to surgery. Non-monetary measures of well-being include self-assessments of overall health, mental health, hope, self-efficacy, happiness and life satisfaction. For patients, the benefits included statistically significant improvements in earnings, mobility, self-care, the ability to undertake daily activities, self-assessed health and mental health, life satisfaction, hope, and self-efficacy (p<0.01). For caregivers, attendance at work improved alongside overall health, mental health, hope, self-efficacy, happiness and life satisfaction, three months post-surgery (p<0.01). Restoring sight has positive impacts for those suffering from cataracts and their caregivers. Sometimes the benefits are almost equal in their magnitude. The study has also demonstrated that many of these impacts are non-monetary in nature. It is clear that estimates of the rate of return to restoring sight that focus only on financial gains will underestimate the true returns to society of restoring sight from cataract surgeries."
"Relationships between body mass index and self-reported motorcycle crashes in Vietnam Bus Drivers; Motor Vehicles; Job Content The relationship between overweight, obesity, or body mass index (BMI) and crashes among drivers of passenger cars, vans, and trucks has been the focus of much research. However, little is understood about this relationship among motorcyclists, particularly motorcycle taxi drivers who tend to work long hours. Motorcycle taxis are an increasingly popular and important mode of travel in many cities, especially in South-East Asia, due partly to the rise of ride-hailing services. This paper assesses the body mass index (BMI) of motorcycle taxi drivers in Vietnam and its impacts on crashes among three types of drivers (traditional, ride-hailing, and hybrid). Data from a structured questionnaire survey of motorcycle taxi drivers conducted in Hanoi, Vietnam were used. Results show that 18.8% of motorcycle taxi drivers were overweight or obese whereas only 1.4% were underweight. Fulltime motorcycle taxi drivers were more likely to be overweight or obese. Results of random effect binary logistic regression show that overweight and obese motorcycle taxi drivers had significantly higher overall and injury crash risks, when compared to normal-weight motorcycle taxi drivers. Results also indicate that hybrid motorcycle taxi drivers had lower overall and injury crash risks when compared to traditional motorcycle taxi drivers."
"Intimate partner aggression and work: An interdisciplinary review and agenda for future research Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Economics of Scale Intimate partner aggression (IPA) is a social issue that affects the workplace. While IPA has been relatively ignored by management scholars due to notions that it is a private domestic matter, recent research offers mounting evidence of its spillover effects at work, including consequences for victims, perpetrators, coworkers, and organizations. To date, scholarly research on IPA and work has been impeded because existing research is scattered across disciplines with differing conceptualizations and emphasis. This integrative review aims to clarify the constructs of IPA and work-related IPA (WIPA), summarize existing IPA and work research, integrate prior studies to offer a nomological network of antecedents and consequences of IPA victimization and perpetration, and propose specific recommendations that can further stimulate scholarly attention on this important research area."
"Optimizing rooftop photovoltaic distributed generation with battery storage for peer-to-peer energy trading Demand Response; Demand Side Management; Energy Conservation Distributed generation (DG) based on rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems with battery storages is a promising alternative energy generation technology to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. As regulatory tariff-based incentives are diminishing, innovative solutions are required to sustain this renewable energy generation. An optimization model is proposed to maximize the economic benefits for rooftop PV-battery DG in a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading environment. The goal of the proposed model is to investigate the feasibility of such renewable source participated P2P energy trading by examining the economic benefits. The model is illustrated in a simulation framework for a local community with 500 households under real-world constraints encompassing PV systems, battery storage, customer demand profiles and market signals including the retail price, feed-in tariff and P2P energy trading mechanism. Interactions among peer-to-peer trading stakeholders are examined, quantifying household savings for different scenarios of this P2P-based DG. Household energy savings are identified to be sensitive to many factors including the scale of PV systems, the PV penetration, the P2P trading margins, the presence of battery storage and energy trading time. The model shows that maximal savings up to 28% can be achieved by households equipped with larger PV systems and battery storages during weekdays from an exemplified case. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that households with PV systems have lower savings when PV penetration is high owing to excessive energy traded on the P2P market, pushing down the clearing price and the savings gain. Households with a battery-only configuration are shown to achieve fewer savings in contrast to households without any renewable resources in a P2P trading community. The model's energy insights are the beginning of understanding the actual impact of policy, market and technical signals on economic benefits for household distributed renewable generation in a P2P energy trading market."
"The impacts of different biological treatments on the transformation of explosives waste contaminated sludge Trinitrotoluene; Cyclonite; Bioremediation The dinitrotoluene isomers 2,4 and 2,6â€dinitrotoluene (DNT) represent highly toxic, mu-tagenic, and carcinogenic compounds used in explosive manufacturing and in commercial production of polyurethane foam. Bioremediation, the use of microbes to degrade residual DNT in industry wastewaters, represents a promising, low cost and environmentally friendly alternative technology to landfilling. In the present study, the effect of different bioremediation strategies on the degradation of DNT in a microcosmâ€based study was evaluated. Biostimulation of the indigenous microbial community with sulphur phosphate (2.3 g/kg sludge) enhanced DNT transformation (82% trans-formation, from 300 g/L at Day 0 to 55 g/L in week 6) compared to natural attenuation over the same period at 25 Â°C. The indigenous microbial activity was found to be capable of transforming the contaminant, with around 70% transformation of DNT occurring over the microcosm study. 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that while the original bacterial community was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria (30%), the addition of sulphur phosphate significantly increased the abun-dance of Betaproteobacteria by the end of the biostimulation treatment, with the bacterial community dominated by Burkholderia (46%) followed by Rhodanobacter, Acidovorax and Pseudomonas. In summary, the results suggest biostimulation as a treatment choice for the remediation of dinitrotol-uenes and explosives waste."
"Recycling steel slag from municipal wastewater treatment plants into concrete applications – A step towards circular economy Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption Municipal wastewater is a major source of the release of phosphorus into the marine environment, and its excessive release could negatively impact marine flora and fauna. In this study, steel slag a by-product from steel industry was used to remove phosphorus content from the municipal wastewater. The Langmuir isotherm model revealed a maximum adsorption capacity of 3.8 mg phosphate/g of steelmaking slag. The results showed that the phosphate removal efficiency of granular slag was about 90%. The wastewater contained a significant amount of iron and manganese content that was filtered out by the slag granules. X-ray fluorescence and x-ray diffraction analysis show that the wastewater treatment process changes the chemical phase composition of slag in addition to the absorption/adsorption of various chemicals within its pore structure. To recycle this waste slag after the water treatment process, that significantly altered its chemical and mineralogical composition, it was used in concrete as a replacement of conventional coarse aggregates. The results show that the treated slag aggregates provide compressive strength improvement of 32.5% and 18% at 7 days and 8.2 and 16.8% improvement at 28 days compared to that of raw slag and conventional aggregates, respectively. In addition, due to the pozzolanic nature of slag both the raw and treated slag aggregates showed a seamless monolithic bond at the interfacial transition zone between the slag and the cement matrix. This study demonstrates that the waste slag generated from the wastewater treatment process has a great potential to be used as a replacement of conventional aggregates in concrete applications."
"Marine reserves stabilize fish populations and fisheries yields in disturbed coral reef systems Marine Protected Areas; Marine Parks; Environmental Protection Marine reserve networks are increasingly implemented to conserve biodiversity and enhance the persistence and resilience of exploited species and ecosystems. However, the efficacy of marine reserve networks in frequently disturbed systems, such as coral reefs, has rarely been evaluated. Here we analyze a well-mixed larval pool model and a spatially explicit model based on a well-documented coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) metapopulation in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia, to determine the effects of marine reserve coverage and placement (in relation to larval connectivity and disturbance heterogeneity) on the temporal stability of fisheries yields and population biomass in environmentally disturbed systems. We show that marine reserves can contribute to stabilizing fishery yield while increasing metapopulation persistence, irrespective of whether reserves enhance or diminish average fishery yields. However, reserve placement and the level of larval connectivity among subpopulations were important factors affecting the stability and sustainability of fisheries and fish metapopulations. Protecting a mix of disturbed and non-disturbed reefs, rather than focusing on the least-disturbed habitats, was the most consistently beneficial approach across a range of dispersal and reserve coverage scenarios. Placing reserves only in non-disturbed areas was the most beneficial for biomass enhancement, but had variable results for fisheries and could potentially destabilize yields in systems with well-mixed larval or those that are moderately fished. We also found that focusing protection on highly disturbed areas could actually increase variability in yields and biomass, especially when degraded reef reserves were distant and poorly connected to the meta-population. Our findings have implications for the design and implementation of reserve networks in the presence of stochastic, patchy environmental disturbances."
"Intensification of sonochemical reactions in solid-liquid systems under fully suspended condition Cavitation; Advanced Oxidation; Ultrasound Process intensification of sonochemical reactions due to the addition of solids is studied using very high solids concentrations (up to 0.5 (v/v)). The impacts of particle size, surface roughness, and solids concentration on sonochemical yields were studied experimentally by measuring the concentration of I3âˆ’ formed in the cavitation of potassium iodide solution in an agitated baffled tank fitted with an ultrasonic generator (20 kHz, 131 W). Solids used were cation exchange resin (625 Î¼m), sand (303 Î¼m), and spherical glass beads (207, 551 and 1290 Î¼m). It was found that, due to the net effect of wave attenuation and increased number of nucleation sites available, cavitation level initially decreases with increasing solids concentration up to 0.1 (v/v), then increases up to 0.4 (v/v), followed by a further decrease. Cavitation activity increases with increasing particle diameter due to the reduction in the liquid tensile strength in the presence of larger particles, which decrease the cavitation threshold. The cavitation level is found to be enhanced due to an increase in the surface roughness. The results imply that particle size, concentration, and surface roughness all play important roles in the formation and subsequent collapse of cavities, which cumulatively influence sonochemical reaction yields."
"Identifying Grassroots Opportunities and Barriers to mHealth Design for HIV/AIDS Using a Communicative Ecologies Framework Text Messaging; E-Health; Mobile Phone The aim of this qualitative study was to test how social and cultural research methods can be used to anticipate opportunities and barriers to the use of consumer mobile devices by community health workers (CHWs) for HIV/AIDS prevention, testing and treatment. An exploratory study was conducted with CHWs (n = 19) at the regional capitals of Denpasar and Makassar in Indonesia in order to build to a clearer picture of how the participants have integrated personal mobile handsets into their daily professional and personal routine. A communicative ecologies framework was applied to the research design which included a range of qualitative methods including in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and communicative ecology mapping. Our main findings revealed that there was no bottom-up impetus for the introduction of a formal mHealth system to support client interactions. Existing client data collection systems were locked into paper-based systems to ensure compatibility with local government and/or funding body administrative systems; hence, mobile device-based data collection would require additional processes by the participants. Boundary issues were reported with regard to out of hours contact by clients. Some CHWs sent SMS medication reminders to clients but the strong preference indicated by all participating CHWs was to meet clients face-to-face in order to build and maintain trust through the in-person counselling process, rather than introduce mobile-mediated interaction."
"Measuring the inequality of accessible trams in Melbourne Public Transport; Accessibility; Transit In Melbourne, public policy has recently been enacted to improve access to the tram service with an emphasis upon people with a disability. Achieving that objective requires two elements. One is a low-floor tram and two is an elevated tram stop platform that facilitates boarding the tram. Currently the fleet of trams in Melbourne is made up of high-floor and low-floor designs, thus accessible services are unevenly distributed. In addition, construction of new tram stop platforms has been uneven. This suggests a form of inequality in accessible tram services for the disabled. Several studies of transport services have addressed this issue using the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve calculations as seen in studies of disadvantaged groups such as the elderly. This research utilizes those approaches to estimate the current access of the disabled population to trams services in Melbourne. The approach compares the geography of the total and accessible tram services with the geography of the total and disabled population using the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve. The results show that there is inequality in the accessible trams amongst people with a disability in Melbourne (Gini = 0.66) as 70% of the disabled population has access to only 22% of the accessible tram supply. In comparison, considering the total tram supply and the entire population, (Gini = 0.48) 70% of the population shares 40% of the tram supply. Hence, at this stage the provision of accessible tram services for people with a disability falls well below that of the general population. These results provide an insight into the current tram service inequality and can be used as a reference for future tram system investment. Further, the approach could be used to increase awareness of this matter and encourage an inclusive and sustainable public transport planning and development in both local and global contexts."
"Students’ perceptions of employability following a capstone course Employability; Competency; Soft Skills Purpose: Graduate employability represents a fundamental outcome of higher education. The purpose of this paper is to explore and compare studentsâ€™ perceptions of their employability through their experience of a simulated or real-life project. The context of the project is a capstone course, implemented in an Australian university, which was designed to enhance employability and foster transferable graduate attributes, including professional communication, interpersonal and leadership skills. Design/methodology/approach: The authors designed and conducted quantitative research to capture and measure studentsâ€™ perceptions of their employability at the conclusion of a capstone course over three consecutive years from 2015 to 2017. Findings: The results of this paper show that students undertaking a real-life project which makes a social contribution reported a significantly stronger development of work-ready skills in managing projects than students undertaking a simulation project. Specifically, interaction with industry and leadership were reported to be more developed. Originality/value: The study contributes to knowledge of the relationship between capstone learning and studentsâ€™ perceptions of employability. It advances the understanding of capstone course design and pedagogy which strengthens the link between learning and work."

"A Resource-Based Typology of Dynamic Capability: Managing Tourism in a Turbulent Environment Tourist; Destination Image; Risk Perception This study develops a typology of dynamic capabilities to advance knowledge on how tourism organizations can manage disruptive external changes. It uses the context of a natural disaster. The article goes beyond a simple classification of organizational activities in responding to crises/disasters to create a typology of 12 dynamic capabilities. The typology is based on three dimensions that align with the disaster life cycle, source of resources, and deployment of resources. This study also provides empirical explanations for each type of dynamic capability, using qualitative data collected from 40 in-depth interviews with tourism organizations and other stakeholders across two years. Several practical implications and future research directions are provided based on the findings and limitations of the study."
"Intercultural and Interdisciplinary Engagement for Embedding Sustainability Internship and Residency; Internship Program; Employability Sustainability teaching and learning is about understanding and making decisions that support outcomes to achieve the triple bottom line: environmental, economic and social. To ensure sustainability outcomes, scholars have called for curricular innovation to support interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary learning to embed sustainability learning for students. This entry presents a cross-cultural immersive experience for teaching and learning sustainability outcomes from environmental, economic and social dimensions for Australian and Indonesian students. The combined classroom with students from Australia and Indonesia was set up. Prior discussions with teaching staff from the two universities and engagement with the villagers in Indonesia set up the scope of the teaching and learning experiences for both cohorts of students. Australian students funded through the New Colombo Plan from various disciplinary programs interacted with architecture and design students from an Indonesian university in Indonesia over a two-week period. The students worked collaboratively to undertake a needs analysis and develop designs for a multifunction educational facility for a village in the island of Java, Indonesia. The village community was involved in the participatory process for informing and developing the concept designs, which were then presented to the village community for selection and construction. The students and teachers were strangers to each other before the collaborative classroom experience. Yet, the bonds formed between teachers and students of both cultures went beyond the classroom. The cohorts of Australian students and the Indonesian students continued to engage with each other not just immediately after their experience of working together in the Indonesian classroom, but also beyond their university life. Such experiences during university life not only create a deeper understanding of sustainability from multiple dimensions, but also life-long friendships between students, shaping their post university work and life experiences. Recommendations are provided to support such experiences."
"Teacher professional development for disability inclusion in low- and middle-income Asia-Pacific countries: An evidence and gap map Inclusive Education; Special Educational Needs; Psychological Practice Background: In the Asia-Pacific region, around one-third of the children who are out-of-school have a disability and given that teacher readiness and capability are key contributors for inclusive education, it is high time for a mapping of disability inclusive teacher professional development (TPD) interventions in this region. Objectives: The key objective of this evidence and gap map (EGM) is to locate evidence on interventions for in-service TPD focussing on education for the inclusion of students with a disability in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the Asia-Pacific region. Search Methods: A broad range of bibliographic databases and repositories were searched electronically to identify the evidence published between January 2000 and December 2021. Key search platforms included the British Education Index (BEI), Education Research Complete (ERC), Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), SCOPUS, 3ie Development Evidence Portal (Evidence Hub) and the Campbell Collaborations Systematic Reviews and EGMs portal (Better evidence for a better world). In addition, potential program evaluations/impact reports, reviews, case studies, and program descriptions/summaries were sought through â€˜snowballingâ€™ based on searching bibliographies and reference lists of papers located during the search process, as well as specific searches of relevant grey literature. Selection Criteria: To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to contain sufficient details about TPD interventions that support early childhood educators and kindergarten to Year 12 teachers to understand the needs of students with disabilities and aid them to create inclusive mainstream classrooms and/or provide improved support for students with disabilities in special education settings. Data Collection and Analysis: A total of 820 records were entered into the MS Excel file in which the entire data extraction process was managed. All records were screened against the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and any differences were resolved through consultations. All included studies and their characteristics were extracted from the MS Excel file and uploaded to the ACER server in.csv file format. The interactive, online EGM is available here: https://datavis.acer.org/gem/disability-inclusion-TPD/. Main Results: Fifty studies from 16 countries out of the 41 LMICs in the Asia-Pacific region were identified, whereby Thailand had the largest number of studies with evidence (7) followed by China, Vietnam, and India (5 each). Two main gaps in research about professional learning were identified. First, only three studies reported interventions aimed at supporting mental health among students with a disability. Second, no studies were found that reported on how teachers could support positive student behaviour. These gaps are important because research has persistently suggested that experiencing disability is an important risk factor for young people developing mental health conditions. Authors' Conclusions: This report illustrates the critical value of evaluating and publishing evidence from disability inclusive TPD interventions in LMICs, including any that are ongoing, or are components of highly resource intensive large-scale education sector programs."
"Sustainability and academic air travel in Australian universities Snow Making; Skiing; Skis Purpose: Air travel is becoming increasingly recognized as a source of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. This is particularly relevant for the university sector, which relies heavily on staff air travel for domestic and international mobility. Design/methodology/approach: Using a qualitative content and textual analysis of Australian university sustainability policies, documents and Web pages, this paper discusses the extent to which these organizations take the task of reducing emissions from flying seriously. Findings: Universities fall into one of three groups in this regard. â€œAir Travel Ignorersâ€ are organizations that either have no sustainability policy or none that recognize air travel as a source of greenhouse gas emissions. The second group â€“ â€œRecognition without Interventionâ€ â€“ describes universities that do acknowledge the role of air travel in their carbon footprint, but do not propose any means to reduce the amount of flying they do. Third, â€œAir Travel Substitutersâ€ seek to substitute their air travel with a digital form of mobility, usually video conferencing. Research limitations/implications: The authors then highlight the need to decrease and denormalize university air travel through shifting shared expectations of mobility for events such as conferences and meetings. Practical implications: By way of a conclusion, the authors discuss the nature of air travel for Australian academia and the relationship between various forms of mobility, connectedness and co-presence. Originality/value: This is the first comprehensive analysis of Australian university sustainability policies with respect to air travel."
"Racialising domestic violence: Islamophobia and the Australian forced marriage debate Forced Marriage; Human Rights; Mens Rea Amid claims that forced marriage is rife in Australiaâ€™s minority communities, 2013 saw the introduction of criminal legislation outlawing forced marriage in Australia. Within public debate, this punitive measure came to overshadow all other modes of addressing the problem; for instance, education programmes, civil legislation and targeted domestic violence support services. This article examines print media coverage of forced marriage over the thirteen-year period leading up to the introduction of criminal legislation. Exploring a discourse that overwhelmingly understands forced marriage as a problem of Islam and multiculturalism, and that marginalises the experiences of women and service providers, the author identifies distinct conservative and liberal representations of forced marriage which racialise domestic violence. Conservatives maintain that forced marriage is empirical evidence of an impending Muslim â€˜takeoverâ€™ of the West precipitated by multiculturalism. Liberals reassert the importance of western values through specific criminal legislation to temper male minority ethnic violence. The material consequence of these Orientalist framings is a narrowing of services available to women seeking to escape violence. The article seeks to understand the processes of meaning-making in which forced marriage is implicated and how the issue is situated within the domain of national political ideology, as opposed to family violence."
"Differential Regulation of Genes Involved in Root Morphogenesis and Cell Wall Modification is Associated with Salinity Tolerance in Chickpea Salt Tolerance; Sodium Proton Exchange Protein; Salinity Salinity is a major constraint for intrinsically salt sensitive grain legume chickpea. Chickpea exhibits large genetic variation amongst cultivars, which show better yields in saline conditions but still need to be improved further for sustainable crop production. Based on previous multi-location physiological screening, JG 11 (salt tolerant) and ICCV 2 (salt sensitive) were subjected to salt stress to evaluate their physiological and transcriptional responses. A total of ~480 million RNA-Seq reads were sequenced from root tissues which resulted in identification of 3,053 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to salt stress. Reproductive stage shows high number of DEGs suggesting major transcriptional reorganization in response to salt to enable tolerance. Importantly, cationic peroxidase, Aspartic ase, NRT1/PTR, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase, DREB1E and ERF genes were significantly up-regulated in tolerant genotype. In addition, we identified a suite of important genes involved in cell wall modification and root morphogenesis such as dirigent proteins, expansin and casparian strip membrane proteins that could potentially confer salt tolerance. Further, phytohormonal cross-talk between ERF and PIN-FORMED genes which modulate the root growth was observed. The gene set enrichment analysis and functional annotation of these genes suggests they may be utilised as potential candidates for improving chickpea salt tolerance."
"Next Generation Mega Satellite Networks for Access Equality: Opportunities, Challenges, and Performance Satellite Communications; Antenna; Moment Generating Function Digital connectivity has become the foundation of prosperity and an essential need for functioning societies. Despite this dependence, limitation on Internet access remains a prevalent issue, largely hinging on socioeconomic and geographic factors. A promising solution to attain global access equality is based on integrated terrestrial-satellite networks that rely on low Earth orbit (LEO) mega constellations. While the benefits of LEO constellations complement the shortcomings of terrestrial networks, their incorporation impacts the network design, adding complexity and challenges. This article presents a systematic analysis of next generation LEO mega satellite constellations, outlining opportunities by virtue of the many benefits these constellations can provide and highlighting the major challenges. Furthermore, it provides a synopsis of analytic models and underscores modern simulation approaches for next generation mega satellite constellations. This article provides network designers with the necessary insights into satellite network performance."
"Educators' experiences and strategies for responding to ecological distress Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Climate Change; Skepticism Research is increasingly identifying the issues of ecological distress, eco-anxiety and climate grief. These painful experiences arise from heightened ecological knowledge and concern, which are commonly considered to be de facto aims of environmental education. Yet little research investigates the issues of climate change anxiety in educational spaces, nor how educators seek to respond to or prevent such emotional experiences. This study surveyed environmental educators in eastern Australia about their experiences and strategies for responding to their learners' ecological distress. Educators reported that their students commonly experienced feeling overwhelmed, hopeless, anxious, angry, sad and frustrated when engaging with ecological crises. Educators' strategies for responding to their learners' needs included encouraging students to engage with their emotions, validating those emotions, supporting students to navigate and respond to those emotions and empowering them to take climate action. Educators felt that supporting their students to face and respond to ecological crises was an extremely challenging task, one which was hindered by time limitations, their own emotional distress, professional expectations, society-wide climate denial and a lack of guidance on what works."
"Australian birds could benefit from predator exclusion fencing Dingoes; Mammals; Vulpes Vulpes The use of predator exclusion fencing is widely recognized as one of the most effective mechanisms for protecting threatened fauna from introduced or overabundant predators. It is now used throughout the world to protect avian fauna. In Australia, where predator exclusion fencing is used extensively to protect threatened mammals, such fences for threatened avifauna are surprisingly sparse. In this perspective we demonstrate that (a) the use of predator exclusion fences for avifauna is popular in other countries with similar conservation problems, (b) a large number of Australian avian species could benefit from dedicated predator exclusion fences, and (c) despite legitimate concerns, if well designed, predator exclusion fences can pose little risk to threatened birds or are outweighed by the potential benefits. We believe wider use of predator exclusion fencing to protect Australian threatened birds could be highly beneficial and should be more regularly considered as a management action by conservation practitioners."
"Are fire services ‘extremely gendered’ organizations? Examining the Country Fire Authority (CFA) in Australia Wildfires; Wildland-Urban Interface; Disaster Emergency management organizations often have military-based histories and continue to maintain militaristic styles of operation. Similar to the military, these organizations tend to be male dominated and culturally masculinized. The militarization and masculinization of rural fire services in Australia are generally unrecognized but highly important elements defining these organizations, and the example of the Country Fire Authority (CFA) is considered here. Using a cultural artefacts approach, historical and contemporary elements of the CFA's structure and practice are analysed using the concept of an â€˜extremely genderedâ€™ organization, with a focus on how the CFA is structurally and culturally gendered. We argue there is value in expanding the notion of â€˜extremely genderedâ€™ institutions beyond the military, to include other militarized organizations. Doing so not only helps to better understand and address resistance to change and gender equality measures, it also draws attention to the important role that such organizations play in the greater patriarchal order."
"Space debris collision probability analysis for proposed global broadband constellations Space Debris; Spacecraft; Low Earth Orbits Fragmentation events, caused by the collision of two objects in space, have been a significant source of space debris objects over a cumulative five decades of space activity. Current proposals by different commercial entities aim to launch constellations comprising thousands of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which would result in an increase of more than five times the number of currently active satellites in a region where debris objects are most concentrated. The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) has already recognized the potential influence of large constellations on the LEO environment and the subsequent need to assess whether current mitigation guidelines will be adequate moving forward. Given developments for such constellations are already underway, independent research efforts ahead of any revision to current IADC guidelines could be of great value not only to the organizations involved in their operation, but also to policymakers and existing space users. This paper evaluates the probability of collisions for mega-constellations operating in the current LEO debris environment under best and worst-case implementation of current mitigation guidelines. Simulation studies are performed using the European Space Agency's (ESA) MASTER-2009 debris evolutionary model, and the specifications of the proposed OneWeb and SpaceX constellations as example mega-constellations. Multiple scenarios are then tested to assess mitigation measures and their ability to minimize the probability of fragmentation events and the creation of new debris in LEO."
"The macroeconomy and microfinance outreach: a panel data analysis Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion This study examines the effects of macroeconomic and institutional factors on microfinance institution (MFI) outreach. To capture the performance of the macroeconomy, we include proxies for institutional quality, economic growth, FDI inflow, unemployment rate, inflation and the prevalence of wage-earning jobs. Further, we examine effects on outreach along the dimensions of outreach depth and outreach breadth. Using data on 1526 MFIs from 99 countries over the period 2000 to 2015, our results suggest that environments characterised by high levels of economic performance and good institutions tend to hinder outreach performance. These results suggest that MFIs depend on a poor economy to thrive given the informal nature of microfinance."
"The Geography of Gender Inequality in International Higher Education Gender Inequality; Labour Market; Gender Wage Gap The internationalization of higher education results in 4.6 million students attending colleges and universities outside their home countries. In the United States and other countries, there is significant underrepresentation of women among inbound international higher education students. Gender equality in education cannot be achieved so long as women are underrepresented in participation in this important educational venue. To better understand the drivers of gender inequalities in international higher education, this study examines the low participation rate by women coming to the United States by comparing it with participation data for women coming to the United Kingdom and Germany. Gender participation rates from both source regions and countries vary by destination country. By exploring the geography of gender inequality in international higher education, decision makers can better understand barriers to achieving international gender equality goals."
"Narcissism, political tenure, financial indicators and the effectiveness of environmental regulation Impression Management; Annual Reports; Chief Executive Officer This article explores the factors that determine the effectiveness of environmental regulation in the United States and Australia. Unlike prior literature, in which lagging performance measures (such as carbon emissions) are used, we use financial data to develop effectiveness scores and identify the determinants of effectiveness, including narcissistic behaviour, tenure of political leaders and financial indicators. Consistent with the emerging literature on environmental finance, we find that abnormal returns are associated with environmental regulation and that effectiveness is adversely affected when narcissistic leaders are in power. Our results remain robust when we control for various event windows and models."
"Indigenous masculinity in sport: the power and pitfalls of rugby league for Australia’s Pacific Island diaspora Fiji; Sports; Methodism Pasifika men are significantly over-represented in Australiaâ€™s National Rugby League and their dramatic influx into the sport over the past 10â€“15 years has often been attributed to their â€˜naturalâ€™ athleticism and other corporeal reasons invoking hyper-masculinity. Coupled with this discourse is the commonly accepted idea that these sporting opportunities are a good thing for Pasifika peoples. This paper considers both the damaging effects of the â€˜hyper-masculine bodyâ€™ and â€˜sport-as-inherently goodâ€™ discourses, and addresses the positive potential rugby league has in transgressing various forms of oppression. Rather than arguing that sport is a positive force in society or outright challenging that assertion, I demonstrate how rugby league in Australia plays a paradoxical role in both reinforcing and challenging social values around race and masculinity. It can be a rare space for positive visibility and upward mobility for Pasifika and other Indigenous men, and a space of exploitation, degradation and racism; it can even save lives and destroy them. I argue that these complexities should be better understood before any moral claim is made about the positives or negatives of sport for marginalised peoples."
"Implications of co-contamination with aged heavy metals and total petroleum hydrocarbons on natural attenuation and ecotoxicity in Australian soils Bioremediation; Bioaugmentation; Contaminated Soil The bioremediation of historic industrial contaminated sites is a complex process. Co-contamination, often with lead which was commonly added to gasoline until 16 years ago is one of the biggest challenges affecting the clean-up of these sites. In this study, the effect of heavy metals, as co-contaminant, together with total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) is reported, in terms of remaining soil toxicity and the structure of the microbial communities. Contaminated soil samples from a relatively hot and dry climate in Western Australia were collected (n = 27). Analysis of soils showed the presence of both contaminants, TPHs and heavy metals. The Microtox test confirmed that their co-presence elevated the remaining ecotoxicity. Toxicity was correlated with the presence of lead, zinc and TPH (0.893, 0.599 and 0.488), respectively, assessed using Pearson Correlation coefficient factor. Next Generation Sequencing of soil bacterial 16S rRNA, revealed a lack of dominate genera; however, despite the variation in soil type, a few genera including Azospirillum spp. and Conexibacter were present in most soil samples (85% and 82% of all soils, respectively). Likewise, many genera of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were identified in all soil samples. Streptomyces spp. was presented in 93% of the samples with abundance between 7% and 40%. In contrast, Acinetobacter spp. was found in only one sample but was a dominant member of (45%) of the microbial community. In addition, some bacterial genera were correlated to the presence of the heavy metals, such as Geodermatophilus spp., Rhodovibrio spp. and Rubrobacter spp. which were correlated with copper, lead and zinc, respectively. This study concludes that TPH and heavy metal co-contamination significantly elevated the associated toxicity. This is an important consideration when carrying out risk assessment associated with natural attenuation. This study also improves knowledge about the dynamics of microbial communities in mixed contamination scenarios. Elevated ecotoxicity was associated with the presence of heavy metals along with TPH in soil samples. Many hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were observed with no major dominance."
"The built environment and energy efficiency in Australia: Current state of play and where to next Insulation; Energy; Energy Saving in Building This chapter provides a review and critique of the development and current status of approaches to improve energy efficiency and broader sustainability in the Australian built environment. The focus is on the minimum building performance requirements set through the National Construction Codeâ€”Building Code of Australia, but the chapter also includes other mandatory and voluntary approaches which have been introduced over the past two decades. The chapter concludes with a discussion that highlights current gaps that relate to the delivery of a low-carbon/low-energy built environment. It recognises that Australia currently fails to meet international building performance best practice standards, particularly in the residential sector, and this situation can only be reversed if various levels of government in Australia increase the regulated level of energy performance of buildings coupled with a more holistic and progressive inclusion of all energy consumed and generated within a building. This would be better aligned with improving actual impacts a building has over its lifecycle and on the community at large."
"Ordered Mesoporous Graphitic Carbon/Iron Carbide Composites with High Porosity as a Sulfur Host for Li-S Batteries Lithium Sulfur Batteries; Polysulfides; Electrode The lithium-sulfur battery (LSB) is a promising candidate for future energy storage but faces technological challenges including the low electronic conductivity of sulfur and the solubility of intermediates during cycling. Additionally, current host materials often lack sufficient conductivity and porosity to raise the sulfur loading to over 80 wt %. Here, ordered mesoporous graphitic carbon/iron carbide nanocomposites were prepared via an evaporation-induced self-assembly process using soluble resol, prehydrolyzed tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and iron(III) chloride as the carbon, silica (SiO 2 ), and iron precursors, respectively. Graphitization and SiO 2 etching were conducted simultaneously via Teflon-assisted, solid-state decomposition at high temperature. A high surface area (âˆ¼3100 m 2 g -1 ), large pore volume (âˆ¼3.3 cm 3 g -1 ), and graphitized carbon frame were achieved, giving a high sulfur loading (85 wt %) while tolerating volumetric expansion during discharge. Electrochemical testing of a LSB containing the composite/sulfur cathode exhibited a superior reversible capacity exceeding 1300 mAh g -1 at a moderate current (C/10) and a low decay in capacity of 9% after 500 cycles at C/5. The interaction between mesoporous graphitic carbon and sulfur is proposed."
"The significance of the Chinese domestic market for narrow-body passenger-to-freighter (P2F) jet aircraft conversions Aircraft; Airline Industry; Airfare This paper examines the reasons for the predicted growth in demand for air cargo in China over the next 20 years, and discusses why standard body freighters will dominate the air cargo sector. Because there are no new-build factory produced freighters available in the standard-body segment, this market is based solely on the conversion of passenger-to-freighter (P2F) aircraft. A survey is conducted of the entire Chinese commercial jet aircraft fleet which reveals a generous feedstock of candidate P2F aircraft (B737/738 and A320/321). This strongly suggests China could easily be self-sufficient in supplying its own standard-body freighters. The major conversion houses are well aware of this market potential, and they are now striking various collaborative arrangements with Chinese MROs. The details of these liaisons are presented which reveal how the nascent P2F ecosystem in China is developing."
"Warm, cool and energy-affordable housing policy solutions for low-income renters Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort This report presents the findings of an Investigative Panel that examined the prevalence and experience of energy hardship, in its different forms, within Australia's rental housing market. The research considered the strategies and policy actions that could be taken to reduce the impact of energy hardship on the lives of Australian households. Important findings include the following. â€¢ Exposure to energy hardship is particularly likely when vulnerable people-i.e. those with very low or no income, existing health issues, lack of support networks, or who face entrenched disadvantage-live in dwellings that are in poor condition. â€¢ Across the private and social rental sectors, the challenges are different with respect to resident/tenant and landlord/property manager relationships, tenants' rights, and the material condition of housing. Hence, the responses required to improve thermal efficiency and reduce energy hardship need to be tailored to the different tenant cohorts. â€¢ No single set of policies or governmental actions will be able to meet the challenge of improving energy efficiency in the rental housing stock. Instead, a portfolio of measures is needed-including, for instance, mandatory building standards, targeted financial or material assistance for very vulnerable households, and investment in the public housing sector. â€¢ Setting minimum standards for the energy performance of rental properties is a critical starting point in the process of reform, which some jurisdictions have already begun to undertake, independent of national leadership. Mandating acceptable levels of thermal performance across the nation's rental housing stock is likely to deliver a population-wide benefit. However, such requirements are also likely to encounter resistance from many stakeholders within the property industry due to perceived added costs. â€¢ Developing a consensus on what constitutes 'safe' housing -and tenants' rights to it-among key government players, non-government stakeholders and housing providers would greatly assist in enabling policy action."
"Development of effective and sustainable adsorbent biomaterial from an agricultural waste material: Cu(II) removal Mechanical Properties; Sisal; Coir Motivated by the significant scope which exists to generate value-added products from agricultural waste materials, in this work a comprehensive study was performed on the microstructure of alkali-treated coconut coir in order to evaluate its potential as an environmentally friendly absorbent. By investigating the influence of the alkali concentration, temperature and treatment time through a systematic Design of Experiments (DOE) approach, it was found that alkali-treated coconut coir possessed greatly improved water and moisture absorption properties (27% and 30% increases, respectively, compared to those of untreated coconut coir). The efficiency of heavy metal removal of treated coconut coir samples has been studied by investigating Cu (II) removal performance of selected samples with higher water and moisture absorbency. The effect of contact time and concentration of Cu (II) on the Cu (II) removal efficiency of samples have been investigated. The results show almost five times higher Cu (II) removal performance for the treated sample compared to raw coconut coir under optimized conditions. These findings highlight that the alkali treatment of biomaterials such as coconut coir can be used to tailor their water-absorbency properties as well as their adsorption properties, providing facile and effective adsorbent materials from readily available agricultural waste materials."
"The role of strategic interactions in risk-taking behavior: A study from asset growth perspective Bank Efficiency; Banking Industry; Banking This study uses panel data on Vietnamese commercial banks from 2008 to 2018 in order to investigate the role of strategic interactions in determining bank risk-taking behavior by considering bank asset growth. The results suggest that aggressive competition is less favorable for banks striving for stability and that a high value of competitive strategy measure (as a proxy for strategic interactions) encourages risk-taking incentives. We also find that the distributional effects of strategic interaction on bank risk-taking because of asset growth reveal that the uncertainty in strategic-interaction-driven profits diminishes in banks with higher growth. This finding is consistent with the idea that when competition becomes more aggressive, bank restructuring should focus on increasing total assets by merging and acquiring small- and medium-sized banks to stabilize the banking sector. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that banks with low leverage or under regulatory pressure engage in more risk-taking. Therefore, policymakers may not implement a tighter capital requirement that contributes to a heightened level of risk. The results are robust to alternative measures of risk-taking and monetary policy stance as well as different econometric specifications."
"Gender, business and human rights: Academic activism as critical engagement in neoliberal times Intersectionality; Feminism; Social Location This paper contributes to the debate about academic activism in organization studies through an exploration of my engagement with recent international policy-making relating to gender, business, and human rights. It brings social movement theory to the debate to elucidate how our work as academic activists can be conceived of in terms of social movement strategies with respect to political opportunities, mobilizing structures, and strategic framing processes. The aim is to further elucidate what we do as academic activists, and how such actions might advance feminist social movement agendas through a process that is both critical AND engaged in neoliberal contexts. I conclude with a discussion of the implications for Gender, Work & Organization (GWO) scholars and the GWO journal."
"Prediction of geological characteristics from shield operational parameters by integrating grid search and K-fold cross validation into stacking classification algorithm TBM; Tunnel; Hard Rock This study presents a framework for predicting geological characteristics based on integrating a stacking classification algorithm (SCA) with a grid search (GS) and K-fold cross validation (K-CV). The SCA includes two learner layers: a primary learner's layer and meta-classifier layer. The accuracy of the SCA can be improved by using the GS and K-CV. The GS was developed to match the hyper-parameters and optimise complicated problems. The K-CV is commonly applied to changing the validation set in a training set. In general, a GS is usually combined with K-CV to produce a corresponding evaluation index and select the best hyper-parameters. The torque penetration index (TPI) and field penetration index (FPI) are proposed based on shield parameters to express the geological characteristics. The elbow method (EM) and silhouette coefficient (Si) are employed to determine the types of geological characteristics (K) in a K-means++ algorithm. A case study on mixed ground in Guangzhou is adopted to validate the applicability of the developed model. The results show that with the developed framework, the four selected parameters, i.e. thrust, advance rate, cutterhead rotation speed and cutterhead torque, can be used to effectively predict the corresponding geological characteristics."
"Exploring a new incubation model for FinTechs: Regulatory sandboxes Business Development; Science Parks; Incubators Research on incubation models indicates that incubators and accelerators are crucial catalysts for the development of start-ups. To facilitate start-ups in financial markets, several regulatory authorities have adopted a new incubation model called a â€˜regulatory sandboxâ€™. Regulatory sandboxes enable eligible applicants to test their technology-enabled financial solutions for a certain period of time (subject to conditions the regulator imposes). As such, these instruments allow innovation while preventing severe instability in financial markets caused by systemic risk. Despite their importance, management research has devoted little attention to studying how sandboxes operate as a new incubation model. In our abductive study, we adopt the activity system framework and a qualitative analysis approach to investigate the activities of five leading sandboxes and compare them with the activities of other incubation models. The data analysis yielded an activity model with three design elements (achieving membership, participating and detaching) and one design theme (improving connectedness). Thus, sandboxes are characterized by providing regulatory guidance and facilitating access to testing across international jurisdictions, distinguishing them from both generic and specialized incubation models. Our primary contribution to the incubation literature is extending the knowledge of a unique incubation model through a set of theoretical propositions."

"Economic viability of building integrated photovoltaics: A review of forty-five (45) non-domestic buildings in twelve (12) western countries Hot Temperature; Phase Change Materials; Photovoltaic System Building-integrated photovoltaic technology (BIPV) is a decentralised renewable energy source with a building material function. Lack of confidence in the economic viability of BIPV has become one of the critical issues in investment decisions. Therefore, there is a need to review the real economic value of recent BIPV projects to dispel the common myth of the high cost of BIPV. This paper reviews forty-five (45) BIPV projects attached to non-domestic buildings located in twelve (12) western countries between 2009 and 2018 to understand their real economic value. Levelized cost energy, net present value and discounted payback periods are estimated to identify both direct and indirect benefits of BIPV. The economic assessment revealed that projects are economically feasible when both direct and indirect are measured. Analysis further discovered that 1) curtain wall, double-skin facades, discontinuous roofs and skylights among the building application types, 2) educational buildings among the functions of non-domestic buildings and 3) c-Si among the module technologies are economically feasible performances. BIPVs are complex and unique designs with diverse economic performances. It is important to carefully select the parameters to assess the performance levels of the application before any decision is made. The study confirms that understanding the broad values facilitates the quantification of the real contribution of BIPV. The outcome of the paper assists decision-makers and policymakers in developing strategies to decide BIPV adoption."
"Repurposing of COVID-19 single-use face masks for pavements base/subbase Environmental Pollution; Medical Waste; COVID-19 The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has not only created a global health crisis, but it is also now threatening the environment. A multidisciplinary collaborative approach is required to fight against the pandemic and reduce the environmental risks associated with the disposal of used personal protective equipment (PPE). This paper explores an innovative way to reduce pandemic-generated waste by recycling the used face masks with other waste materials in civil constructions. In this research, for the first time, a series of experiments, including modified compaction, unconfined compression strength and resilient modulus tests, were conducted on the blends of different percentages of the shredded face mask (SFM) added to the recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) for road base and subbase applications. The experimental results show that RCA mixed with three different percentages (i.e., 1%, 2% and 3%) of SFM satisfied the stiffness and strength requirements for pavements base/subbase. The introduction of the shredded face mask not only increased the strength and stiffness but also improved the ductility and flexibility of RCA/SFM blends. The inclusion of 1% SFM to RCA resulted in the highest values of unconfined compressive strength (216 kPa) and the highest resilient modulus (314.35 MP). However, beyond 2%, increasing the amount of SFM led to a decrease in strength and stiffness."
"Natural attenuation of legacy hydrocarbon spills in pristine soils is feasible despite difficult environmental conditions in the monsoon tropics Bioremediation; Bioaugmentation; Contaminated Soil The Kimberley region of Western Australia is a National Heritage listed region that is internationally recognised for its environmental and cultural significance. However, petroleum spills have been reported at a number of sites across the region, representing an environmental concern. The region is also characterised as having low soil nutrients, high temperatures and monsoonal rain â€“ all of which may limit the potential for natural biodegradation of petroleum. Therefore, this work evaluated the effect of legacy petroleum hydrocarbons on the indigenous soil microbial community (across the domains Archaea, Bacteria and Fungi) at three sites in the Kimberley region. At each site, soil cores were removed from contaminated and control areas and analysed for total petroleum hydrocarbons, soil nutrients, pH and microbial community profiling (using16S rRNA and ITS sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq Platform). The presence of petroleum hydrocarbons decreased microbial diversity across all kingdoms, altered the structure of microbial communities and increased the abundance of putative hydrocarbon degraders (e.g. Mycobacterium, Acremonium, Penicillium, Bjerkandera and Candida). Microbial community shifts from contaminated soils were also associated with an increase in soil nutrients (notably Colwell P and S). Our study highlights the long-term effect of legacy hydrocarbon spills on soil microbial communities and their diversity in remote, infertile monsoonal soils, but also highlights the potential for natural attenuation to occur in these environments."
"Challenging amnesias: re-collecting feminist new materialism/ecofeminism/climate/education Education; Posthuman; Materialist This paper discusses the apparent amnesia with regard to insights manifested in ecofeminist thought and applies a re-collective analysis to thinking on the implications of an ecofeminist new materialism for contemporary environmental education research, and curriculum practice. We engage with a conversation between feminist new materialism and the tropes of ecofeminism at this very unusual time in human history, making visible such interactions. Drawing attention to this and other apparent amnesias and, arguing from a genealogical perspective, we argue the scholarly and conceptual disruption caused by rapidly changing environmental (hence social and cultural) conditions can be fruitfully understood and analysed through a reconceived new materialist ecofeminism. This is especially important given the unequal impact of the climate emergency on women and the continued absence of a truly coherent focus on womenâ€™s interestsâ€“another amnesiaâ€“at this moment when the climate dominates all human and other than human life. In exploring the relationships between feminist new materialism, ecofeminism and the more-than-human, we theoretically + materially consider the conceptual challenges of confronting the climate emergency as viewed through the lens of articulating feminisms; and we promote possibilities for further conceptual and practical environmental education research."
"The capacity to consent to sex in mental health inpatient units Severe Mental Illness; Mental Patient; HIV Infection Objective: Discussions of capacity to consent in mental health care usually revolve around capacity to consent to treatment. This paper instead explores the issue of capacity to consent to sexual activity in a mental health inpatient setting as a way of exploring capacity from a different perspective. This is not a purely theoretical exercise, with both consensual sexual activity and sexual assault commonplace in mental health inpatient units, current policy and practice approaches are clearly not working and require re-examination. Methods: Four key frameworks are explored: human rights law, mental health law, the criminal law and the law of tort governing the duty of care. These frameworks are explored by highlighting relevant case law and statutes and considering their potential application in practice. This is undertaken using the state of Victoria, Australia, as a case study. Results: The four frameworks are shown to be consistent with each other but inconsistent with contemporary policy. All four legal frameworks explored require clinicians to take a case-by-case assessment to ensure that a personâ€™s right to make their own decisions is preserved â€˜unless the contrary is demonstrably justifiedâ€™ or where it is â€˜legally demandedâ€™. While Victorian inpatient units attempt to enforce a blanket ban on consensual sexual activity in inpatient settings, this ban may be without legal basis and may be in breach of both human rights and mental health law. Conclusion: In policing the lawful bodily interactions of their patients and pushing sexual activity out of sight, clinicians may be breaching their duty of care to provide sexual health support and risk creating an environment in which the therapeutic relationship will be sacrificed to the enforcement of institutional policy. Clinicians and policymakers must understand the relevant legal frameworks to ensure that they are acting ethically and lawfully."
"Bioaccumulation kinetics of cadmium and zinc in the freshwater decapod crustacean Paratya australiensis following multiple pulse exposures Assimilation Efficiency; Bioaccumulation; Cadmium Stormwater runoff has been identified as a major source of metal contaminants in urban waterways, where during storm events organisms tend to be exposed to short-term pulses, rather than a constant exposure of contaminants. Current water quality guidelines (WQGs) are generally derived using data from continuous exposure toxicity tests, where there is an assumption that chronic exposures provide a meaningful way of assessing the impacts and effects in organisms as a result of these pulsed storm events. In this current study the radioisotopes 109Cd and 65Zn were used to explore uptake, depuration and organ distribution in the decapod crustacean Paratya australiensis, over three short-term (<10 h) exposures. Exposures to radiolabelled cadmium only, zinc only or a mixture of cadmium and zinc were followed by depuration in metal- and isotope-free water for 7 days. Whole-body metal concentrations were determined by live-animal gamma-spectrometry and an anatomical distribution of the radioisotopes was visualised using autoradiography post-mortem. Both metals were significantly accumulated over the pulsed exposure period. In both treatments cadmium and zinc body burden increased at the same rate over the three pulses. Final metal body burden did not markedly differ when shrimp were exposed to metals individually compared to a binary mixture. Over the course of the depuration period, cadmium efflux was minimal, whereas zinc efflux was significant. Autoradiography indicated the presence of both metals in the gills and hepatopancreas throughout the depuration period. These results demonstrate how short-term repeated exposures result in the accumulation of contaminants by shrimp. This study highlights the importance of considering the inclusion of pulsed toxicity tests in frameworks when deriving WQGs."
"MSIM: A change detection framework for damage assessment in natural disasters Videorecording; Copyright Protection; Hashing This paper investigates how social images and change detection techniques can be applied to identify the damage caused by natural disasters for disaster assessment. We propose a multi-step image matching-based framework (MSIM), which takes advantages of fast clustering, near duplicate image detection and robust boundary matching for the change detection in disasters. We first model the social images by exploiting their tags and locations. After that, we propose a recursive 2-means algorithm over the new data model, and refine the near duplicate detection by local interest point-based matching over image pairs in neighboring clusters. Finally, we propose a novel boundary representation model called relative position annulus (RPA), which is robust to boundary rotation, location shift and editing operations. A new RPA matching method is proposed by extending dynamic time wrapping (DTW) from time to position annulus. We have done extensive experiments to evaluate the high effectiveness and efficiency of our approach."
"Efficient multi-range query processing on trajectories Road Network; Moving Objects; Query With the widespread use of devices with geo-positioning technologies, an unprecedented volume of trajectory data is becoming available. In this paper, we propose and study the problem of multi-range query processing over trajectories, that finds the trajectories that pass through a set of given spatio-temporal ranges. Such queries can facilitate urban planning applications by finding traffic movement flows between different parts of a city at different time intervals. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on answering multi-range queries on trajectories. In particular, we first propose a novel two-level index structure that preserves both the co-location of trajectories, and the co-location of points within trajectories. Next we present an efficient query processing algorithm that employs several pruning techniques at different levels of the index. The results of our extensive experimental studies on two real datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude."
"A decoupling analysis of transport CO2 emissions from economic growth: Evidence from Vietnam Divisia Index; Logarithmic Mean; Carbon Emissions Since economic reforms in the late 1980s, Vietnamâ€™s economy has grown rapidly, but transport activity has grown faster presenting a significant challenge for reducing transport related CO2 emissions. This paper explores this challenge by comprehensively evaluating decoupling in Vietnamâ€™s transport sector over the period 1995 to 2017. Decoupling elasticities reveal that there is no decoupling of transport volumes from GDP, but between 2011 and 2017, CO2 emissions from transport were decoupling from GDP. Digging deeper reveals that the income driver is in an expansive coupling state, and this is mostly due to the structure of the economy. Different drivers of carbon intensity were important at different times. The importance of the drivers fit a hypothesis of economic restructuring and household income growth. Energy intensity constrained emissions growth, especially from 2011, and was the key driver aiding the decoupling process. The analysis suggests that reducing transport intensity together with modal switching offers the most scope for future decoupling. Barriers that limit the decoupling process include cheap fuel prices and a lack of modal alternatives to private road transport as such appropriate policy responses should target these areas.Highlights Comprehensive analysis of decoupling in the transport sector of Vietnam. Vietnamese transport volumes are not decoupling from GDP, but transport CO2 emissions are. Transport intensity, incomes and economic structure hampered decoupling while energy intensity aided decoupling. The decoupling effort model suggests emissions are reducible. Policy responses include removing market inefficiencies and increasing modal choices."
"Cyborg, goddess, or magical girl/heavenly woman? Rethinking gender and technology in science education via Ghost in the Shell Education; Posthuman; Materialist In her widely cited and influential â€œcyborg manifestoâ€, Donna Haraway argues that â€œcyborg imageryâ€ can provide a way out of the maze of dualisms we have used to explain our bodies and our tools to ourselves and concludes by asserting that she would rather be a cyborg than a goddess. We depart from the cyborg/goddess distinction by invoking a widely recognised archetype in Japanese popular media, namely the mahou shoujo (magical girl), who holds a dual identity as an earthly being (usually an adolescent schoolgirl) and a heavenly being (a super-powered girl/woman on a mission against sinister beings). We demonstrate that the distinctively Japanese figurations of the â€œmagical girlâ€ and the â€œheavenly womanâ€ can generate â€œlines of flightâ€ that invite Anglophone science educators to move beyond the Anglosphereâ€™s â€œmaze of dualismsâ€ and science educationâ€™s regulation by dominant systems of signification. Specifically, we invite science educators to rethink representations of gender and technology (e.g. artificial intelligence, robotics) in the light of Masumune Shirouâ€™s manga (comic/graphic novel), The Ghost in the Shell, and its adaptation in Mamouri Oshiiâ€™s similarly titled anime (animated film)."
"Wastewater management in the construction sector: a systemic analysis of current practice in Victoria, Australia Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management Construction activities can use large amounts of water resulting in the discharge of contaminated wastewater from construction sites. However, research into wastewater management in the construction sector is scarce. The objective of this exploratory study was to understand the regulatory and practical aspects of wastewater management in the construction sector in Victoria, Australia. Exploratory interviews among 15 participants from regulatory authorities, local councils and construction firms were conducted. The interviews showed that there was a disconnect between the construction and water authorities and a lack of understanding of wastewater related regulations among construction practitioners. The findings of the interviews were used to develop a system map to illustrate how the system operates and to identify possible intervention points to optimise the system. The evidence from this study suggests that a more collaborative approach across the different agencies is vital to streamline wastewater management practices in the construction sector and the regulatory framework."
"The effect of different treatment strategies on Cardicola spp. (Trematoda: Aporocotylidae) infection in ranched Southern Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) from Port Lincoln, South Australia Opecoelidae; Digenea (Trematoda); Animals The aporocotylids Cardicola forsteri and C. orientalis are considered one of the most significant health concerns for Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) ranched off Port Lincoln, South Australia. In this study we compared the effects of different treatment strategies on blood fluke infections in ranched SBT by sampling from one untreated and two praziquantel treated pontoons progressively throughout the 2018 season. Severity of infection was assessed relative to a number of criteria including adult fluke counts from hearts, egg counts from gill filaments and the use of specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for detection of C. forsteri and C. orientalis ITS-2 DNA in SBT hearts and gills. Cardicola forsteri was the dominant species detected in this study, and intensity of C. forsteri infection in SBT was significantly higher in the untreated pontoon than the two treated pontoons from week 8 of ranching. Cardicola orientalis in SBT was rarely detected, and no significant differences were seen in mortalities or condition of SBT between pontoons. Comparing diagnostic methods for C. forsteri in SBT heart demonstrated qPCR as the gold standard. This study provides important insights into the continued efficacy of praziquantel on blood fluke infections in ranched SBT."
"Resilience building among small businesses in low-income neighborhoods Entrepreneurial Intention; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship The purpose of this article is to investigate the drivers of static and dynamic resilience as a response to the COVID-19-induced crisis among small business entrepreneurs in Brazil. This study explores the role of human, social, and financial capital in the building of resilience responses based on 38 longitudinal case studies. Our interviews indicate that small businesses with lower levels of human capital and social capital were associated with static resilience responses. However, those with higher levels of human capital and higher levels of family social capital had a higher likelihood of developing a richer resource repertoire associated with stronger social media and financial management capabilities, which were associated with dynamic resilience responses. Our study helps in the theoretical understanding of reasons entrepreneurs at times fail to develop novel responses to the crises."
"Does tenure matter for occupant experiences of low-energy housing? Insulation; Energy; Energy Saving in Building International policy settings are looking toward low-energy and near zero-energy homes as a solution to address environmental impacts, particularly anthropogenic climate change. There is increasing research evaluating sustainable housing developments from a technical and occupant perspective. One of the key determinants of household energy use is tenure. However, there is limited research which has looked at if tenure impacts on how occupants experience low-energy homes. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring three low-energy housing developments and exploring the role of tenure in relation to how the households experience the dwellings. The case studies demonstrate that social housing tenants have frustrations with a lack of control over what they could, or could not, do to their low-energy dwellings, in comparison to owner-occupier housing."
"The Resilient Melbourne experiment: Analyzing the conditions for transformative urban resilience implementation Energy Transition; Innovation System; Sustainability This paper examines the Rockefeller Foundation's 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) initiative in Melbourne and frames this as an experiment in urban resilience governance and planning. We respond to the call from urban resilience scholars to consider the 5Ws (who, what, where, when and why?) of resilience and consider what this means for reframing urban resilience implementation. Melbourne is one of the first wave of 33 cities involved in 100RC and the release of the 2016 Strategy is the first attempt at urban resilience governance and planning in this city. We examine its role in mobilizing urban resilience reflecting on the 5Ws and also the â€˜howâ€™, as a governance experiment. With no metropolitan mandate and within a highly fragmented governing context, we develop an analytical framework to assess the 100RC Melbourne initiative identifying a set of conditions for transformative urban resilience implementation incorporating four dimensions â€“ governance and institutional settings (how); inclusions/exclusions (who); framing and purpose (why and what); and system boundaries and interventions (where and when). We reflect on how urban resilience has been framed and adapted within this initiative and the extent to which this process of urban resilience implementation may have the capacity to influence, disrupt or change mainstream urban policy and planning frameworks. We highlight the institution building role the 100RC is playing by mediating between, and connecting, actors, sectors, and interests. We discuss the prospects for shaping a more integrated and inclusive mode of urban governance and resilience planning, a need which has become particularly acute in the context of the shock and ongoing stressor of COVID 19. We conclude by arguing that while experiments such as the 100RC initiative can demonstrate new ways of working collaboratively, explicit attention must be paid to the sets of conditions required to mobilize transformative change in urban resilience implementation."
"Gleaning around the globe: Reframing urban thrift via practices and economies of hard rubbish reuse Developing Countries; Waste Collection; Separation at Source This article examines the practice of gleaning or waste picking, that is, retrieving, reusing and exchanging disposed consumer goods collected from kerbsides and rubbish sites. While the literature has tended to be divided along geographic lines with waste picking either associated with poor communities in the Global South or understood as anti-consumerism activism in the North, this article reframes gleaning as a set of shared global practices conventionally positioned outside of market-based conceptions of economy, value and labour. Discussing a wide array of gleaning activities from around the world, the key argument made is that the alternative economies and practices associated with hard waste reuse activities can be seen as modelling different ways of living (with waste), consuming and disposing that offer potential environmental, economic and social benefits. The article argues that waste reuse activities should be viewed as a set of practices or routines that offer a critique of narrow neoliberal conceptions of economics, enacting instead broader models of value and labour that speak to notions of the public, social and (within limits) planetary good. Furthermore, these post-consumption practices challenge traditional conceptions of passive commodity consumption and disposal, extending the global value chain of goods to incorporate practices of sorting, disassemblage, repair and repurposing. In so doing, it suggests a need (particularly in the Global North) to reconfigure our relationship with and understanding of the life cycles of goods and materials in our lives and to re-materialise our everyday engagements with things as they shift from commodities to waste and back again."
"Emerging investigator series: Phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater by adsorption on steelmaking slag preceding forward osmosis: An integrated process Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption Phosphorus is a critical non-renewable mineral essential for sustainable crop production. However, it is a primary cause of eutrophication in natural water bodies. Hence, a pragmatic approach that allows wastewater treatment plants to efficiently recover phosphorus from wastewater is needed. In this study, we investigated phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater using an industrial waste product (steelmaking slag) as an adsorbent to selectively separate phosphorus from wastewater before its concentration by the forward osmosis (FO) process. Phosphorus adsorbed on slag was extracted, thereby regenerating the adsorbent medium. The resulting phosphorus-rich solution was further enriched by FO prior to chemical precipitation for phosphorus recovery. Batch test results showed that the equilibrium of phosphorus sorption on the slag medium was achieved within 45 min with an adsorption capacity of 3.8 mg g-1. In continuous-flow column tests, the slag exhibited a stable phosphorus removal efficiency of 82% from wastewater, following which approximately 88% of the phosphate could be extracted from the adsorbent medium. When the phosphorus-rich solution extracted from the adsorbent was passed through the FO membrane, FO could retain 98% of the phosphate. However, the water flux through the FO membrane declined gradually to approximately 20% of the initial value at a water recovery of 90%, which could be attributed to the increasingly concentrated feed solution. The enrichment of phosphate in the concentrated feed by the FO process provided a favorable condition for spontaneous precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphate. This study demonstrates that the proposed combined adsorption-FO process can effectively remove, and thus recover, phosphorus from municipal wastewater."
"Energy and exergy analysis of a photovoltaic thermal (PV/T) system using nanofluids: An experimental study Hot Temperature; Phase Change Materials; Photovoltaic System This paper aims to investigate the electrical, thermal and exergy efficiencies of a photovoltaic/ thermal (PV/T) system cooled by Ag/water nanofluid. The utilized nanofluid was prepared by a one-step method of electrical explosion of wire (EEW) and was tested for long-term stability and uniformity. The performance of the PV/T system was measured by considering a wide range of parameters to determine key performance indicators such as electrical and thermal energy efficiency as well as exergy efficiency of the system. The effects of mass flow (i.e. different flow regimes of laminar, transient, and turbulent) on efficiencies were studied. The results showed that using nanofluids for cooling of the PV/T system can enhance both the energy and exergy efficiencies of the system significantly. It was also found that this positive impact is more pronounced by increasing the concentration of the nanofluid and increasing the flow rate (i.e. moving towards a turbulent flow). By using 4 wt% nanofluid (with turbulent flow) the power output of the panel increased by âˆ¼35% and âˆ¼10% compared to when no cooling and water cooling were applied respectively; and the exergy efficiency was also determined to be 50% and 30% higher than when no cooling and water cooling were used, respectively."
"The Operation and Impact of the American Military’s “R&R” Programme in Japan during the Korean War Colonial Korea; Japan; Japanese Empire During the Korean War (1950â€“1953), the US military ran an official â€œrest and recuperationâ€ (R&R) furlough programme that facilitated the travel to Japan of at least half of all deployed American troops. This article draws on memoirs by returnee American veterans of the Korean War, as well as Japanese histories of occupation-era prostitution, to shed light on the R&R programme, which has attracted little attention in English. The sexual exploitation of local women during the Korean War influenced the conduct of the programme, which amounted to sex tourism for the US military. The article highlights the harms of the programme for Japanese women who were sold for prostitution to American GIs by compatriot pimps and traffickers. Campaigns for redress over instances of military prostitution, such as the one in support of the â€œcomfort womenâ€, rely on knowledge cultivated through historical scholarship, so this article contributes to possible future campaigns towards redress for Asian victims of the American militaryâ€™s R&R programme."
"Microfinance in Latin America and the Caribbean: the curse and blessing of ethnic diversity Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion Latin America is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the world, and is also characterized by high levels of poverty. As a poverty alleviation tool, microfinance emerged in the region and has significantly evolved over the years. However, the implications of the regionâ€™s high diversity on the performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs) are however not known. We attempt to fill this gap by providing evidence on the association between MFI performance and indices of ethnic and linguistic fractionalization. Our findings suggest that fractionalization promotes MFI financial performance but is detrimental to outreach depth. These results are robust to various sensitivity tests."
"Personality and pay: Do gender gaps in confidence explain gender gaps in wages? Locus of Control; Labour Market; Personality Traits This study explores whether gender patterns in personality traits contribute to the gender gap in hourly wage rates, focusing on traits that reflect an individual's confidence to take on a challenge. To capture confidence, we use a psychological measurement known as Achievement Motivation, which is dually comprised of 'hope for success' and 'fear of failure'. This personality dimension is examined in addition to the Big Five personality traits and Locus of Control (LOC). Using 2013 wage data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, our Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition model reveals that men's stronger hope for success, lower fear of failure and lower agreeableness contribute to the gender wage gap, while women's higher level of conscientiousness is the only trait that serves to narrow it."
"Review of drivers and threats to coastal groundwater quality in China Nutrients; Submarines; Radon With rapid socio-economic development, China's coastal areas are among the fastest growing and most economically dynamic regions in the world. Under the influence of climate change and human activities, protecting the quality of coastal groundwater has emerged as one of the key environmental and resource management issues for these areas. This paper reviews (for the first time) groundwater quality data for the coastal basins of China, where over 600 million people live, focussing on key inorganic indicators/pollutants; groundwater salinity, nitrate, fluoride, and arsenic. These pollutants present major water quality issues and are also valuable as indicators of wider processes and influences impacting coastal groundwater quality â€“ e.g. saltwater intrusion, agricultural pollution and release of geo-genic contaminants. We discuss the major drivers causing water quality problems in different regions and assess future trajectories and challenges for controlling changes in coastal groundwater quality in China. Multiple processes, including modern and palaeo seawater/brine migration, groundwater pumping for agricultural irrigation, pollution from agrochemical application, rapid development of aquaculture, urban growth, and water transfer projects, may all be responsible (to different degrees) for changes observed in coastal groundwater quality, and associated long-term health and ecological effects. We discuss implications for sustainable coastal aquifer management in China, arguing that groundwater monitoring and contamination control measures require urgent improvement. The evolution and treatment of coastal groundwater quality problems in China will serve as an important warning and example for other countries facing similar pressures, due to climate change, coastal development, and intensification of anthropogenic activity in coming decades."
"Life cycle assessment, energy balance and sensitivity analysis of bioethanol production from microalgae in a tropical country Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Overuse of petroleum and ongoing carbon-di-oxide (CO2) rise in the air of Brunei Darussalam has been emerged as a major environmental concern in this country. To resolve this issue, a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of alternative biofuel, bioethanol production from microalgae was demanded for realistic implementation. Therefore, LCA of bioethanol production from microalgae in terms of CO2 emission and energy balance was investigated based on the scenario of industrial-scale in Brunei Darussalam. This study demonstrated that 220 tons microalgae biomass was cultivated on 6 ha offshore lands for commercial bioethanol generation. The annual outcome of this commercial bioethanol plant has revealed net CO2 balance 218.86 ton. From the energy perspective, this study manifested itself as favourable with net energy ratio, 0.45 and net energy balance, âˆ’2749.6 GJ yâˆ’1. Apart from CO2 balance and energy generation aspect, the project demanded low water and land footprints. For photobioreactor cultivation, water and land footprints were 2 m3 GJâˆ’1 and 2 m2 GJâˆ’1, respectively as well as for open pond approach, they were 87 m3 GJâˆ’1 and 13 m2 GJâˆ’1, respectively. The project also presented microalgae growth supplements (phosphorus and nitrogen) accumulation possibilities from wastewater of manure and industries which is another positive aspect for benign environment. Overall, the commercial plant presented low CO2 emission, low land and water demand for microalgae cultivation, alternative eco-friendly and cheaper nutrients sources, quite high energy generation with main product and by-products. Thus, this study projected positive impact on energy and environmental aspects of microalgae-to-bioethanol conversion."
"Enhancement of Responsivity and Sensitivity of p-Silicon/n-Zinc Oxide-Based Photodetector Using Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles Light Emitting Diodes; Forward Bias; Zinc Oxide Here we report band structure design, fabrication and characterization of a novel ultraviolet photodetector which functions based on the heterostructure between silicon, zinc Oxide, and titanium dioxide nanostructures. For this purpose, Zinc Oxide nanowires were grown on p-type (100) oriented silicon wafer by hydrothermal method and covered by a âˆ¼20nm film of titanium dioxide which were deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Results reveal that in forward bias, the shell titanium dioxide layer reduces the dark current and enhances the sensitivity of photodetector, while in reverse bias titanium dioxide layer increases the responsivity. Responsivity and sensitivity as high as 2.5 A/W and 0.95 are obtained in this work, respectively. In our structure, photocurrent showed a linear dependence to illumination intensity. This linearity together with short response time demonstrate that the titanium dioxide nanostructure lowered the effect of trap states on the photo-response of the device, therefore, the dominant role in photocurrent generation was found to be related to the band structure design of the device."
"Emerging investigator series: Phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater by adsorption on steelmaking slag preceding forward osmosis: An integrated process Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption Phosphorus is a critical non-renewable mineral essential for sustainable crop production. However, it is a primary cause of eutrophication in natural water bodies. Hence, a pragmatic approach that allows wastewater treatment plants to efficiently recover phosphorus from wastewater is needed. In this study, we investigated phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater using an industrial waste product (steelmaking slag) as an adsorbent to selectively separate phosphorus from wastewater before its concentration by the forward osmosis (FO) process. Phosphorus adsorbed on slag was extracted, thereby regenerating the adsorbent medium. The resulting phosphorus-rich solution was further enriched by FO prior to chemical precipitation for phosphorus recovery. Batch test results showed that the equilibrium of phosphorus sorption on the slag medium was achieved within 45 min with an adsorption capacity of 3.8 mg g-1. In continuous-flow column tests, the slag exhibited a stable phosphorus removal efficiency of 82% from wastewater, following which approximately 88% of the phosphate could be extracted from the adsorbent medium. When the phosphorus-rich solution extracted from the adsorbent was passed through the FO membrane, FO could retain 98% of the phosphate. However, the water flux through the FO membrane declined gradually to approximately 20% of the initial value at a water recovery of 90%, which could be attributed to the increasingly concentrated feed solution. The enrichment of phosphate in the concentrated feed by the FO process provided a favorable condition for spontaneous precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphate. This study demonstrates that the proposed combined adsorption-FO process can effectively remove, and thus recover, phosphorus from municipal wastewater."
"Water/watery/watering: Concepts for Theorising in Environmental Education Water Rights; Political Ecology; Peru The assemblage of water/watery/watering is a lively cartography of how water may be accounted for when theorising with and through environmental education research. Challenging the universalising claims of Western technoscience and the colonial logic of extraction, the article develops an alternative theoretical mapping of environmental education through engagements with Ingold's (2007, 2012, 2015) concepts of lines, knots, and knotting. For this article and for the Special Issue in which it is housed, the concepts of such knottings are defined as an assemblage of haecceities, lived events that are looped, tethered and entangled as material and conceptual agencies that inhere within situated encounters. Thus, this article grapples with the need to account for water differently in contemporary posthuman ecologies. To overcome anthropocentric and mastery-oriented approaches, various other ways to account for water in science or environmental education will continue to come to the surface, bubbling and rushing like a waterfall as they have done in this work. Some of these will include thinking with water, which will be central to a theoretical mapping of water that seeks embrace sticky knots. The article explores a (re)turn to artful practices and encounters as spaces in which posthumanist concepts for environmental education might be cultivated."
"Cinnamide derived pyrimidine-benzimidazole hybrids as tubulin inhibitors: Synthesis, in silico and cell growth inhibition studies Antineoplastic Activity; Tubulin Modulators; Combretastatin An approach in modern medicinal chemistry to discover novel bioactive compounds is by mimicking diverse complementary pharmacophores. In extension of this strategy, a new class of piperazine-linked cinnamide derivatives of benzimidazole-pyrimidine hybrids have been designed and synthesized. Their in vitro cytotoxicity profiles were explored on selected human cancer cell lines. Specifically, structural comparison of target hybrids with tubulin-DAMA-colchicine and tubulin-nocodazole complexes has exposed a deep position of benzimidazole ring into the Î±T5 loop. All the synthesized compounds were demonstrated modest to interesting cytotoxicity against different cancer cell lines. The utmost cytotoxicity has shown with an amine linker of benzimidazole-pyrimidine series, with specificity toward A549 (lung cancer) cell line. The most potent compound in this series was 18i, which inhibited cancer cell growth at micromolar concentrations ranging 2.21â€“7.29 ÂµM. Flow cytometry studies disclosed that 18i inhibited the cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle. The potent antitumor activity of 18i resulted from enhanced microtubule disruption at a similar level as nocodazole on Î²-tubulin antibody, explored using immunofluorescence staining. The most active compound 18i also inhibited tubulin polymerization with an IC50 of 5.72 Â± 0.51 ÂµM. In vitro biological analysis of 18i presented apoptosis induction on A549 cells with triggering of ROS generation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in DNA injury. In addition, 18i displayed impairment in cellular migration and inhibited the colony formation. Notably, the safety profile of most potent compound 18i was revealed by screening against normal human pulmonary epithelial cells (L132: IC50: 69.25 Â± 5.95 Î¼M). The detailed binding interactions of 18i with tubulin was investigated by employing molecular docking, superimposition and free energy analyses. Thus remarks made in this study established that pyrimidine-benzimidazole hybrids as a new class of tubulin polymerization inhibitors with significant anticancer activity."
"Live-cell systems in real-time biomonitoring of water pollution: Practical considerations and future perspectives Genetic Procedures; Photorhabdus Luminescens; Whole Cell Continuous monitoring and early warning of potential water contamination with toxic chemicals is of paramount importance for human health and sustainable food production. During the last few decades there have been noteworthy advances in technologies for the automated sensing of physicochemical parameters of water. These do not translate well into online monitoring of chemical pollutants since most of them are either incapable of real-time detection or unable to detect impacts on biological organisms. As a result, biological early warning systems have been proposed to supplement conventional water quality test strategies. Such systems can continuously evaluate physiological parameters of suitable aquatic species and alert the user to the presence of toxicants. In this regard, single cellular organisms, such as bacteria, cyanobacteria, micro-algae and vertebrate cell lines, offer promising avenues for development of water biosensors. Historically, only a handful of systems utilising single-cell organisms have been deployed as established online water biomonitoring tools. Recent advances in recombinant microorganisms, cell immobilisation techniques, live-cell microarrays and microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip technologies open new avenues to develop miniaturised systems capable of detecting a broad range of water contaminants. In experimental settings, they have been shown as sensitive and rapid biosensors with capabilities to detect traces of contaminants. In this work, we critically review the recent advances and practical prospects of biological early warning systems based on live-cell biosensors. We demonstrate historical deployment successes, technological innovations, as well as current challenges for the broader deployment of live-cell biosensors in the monitoring of water quality."
"Non-destructive simulation of node defects in additively manufactured lattice structures Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Additive Manufacturing (AM), commonly referred to as 3D printing, offers the ability to not only fabricate geometrically complex lattice structures but parts in which lattice topologies in-fill volumes bounded by complex surface geometries. However, current AM processes produce defects on the strut and node elements which make up the lattice structure. This creates an inherent difference between the as-designed and as-fabricated geometries, which negatively affects predictions (via numerical simulation) of the lattice's mechanical performance. Although experimental and numerical analysis of an AM lattice's bulk structure, unit cell and struts have been performed, there exists almost no research data on the mechanical response of the individual as-manufactured lattice node elements. This research proposes a methodology that, for the first time, allows non-destructive quantification of the mechanical response of node elements within an as-manufactured lattice structure. A custom-developed tool is used to extract and classify each individual node geometry from micro-computed tomography scans of an AM fabricated lattice. Voxel-based finite element meshes are generated for numerical simulation and the mechanical response distribution is compared to that of the idealised computer-aided design model. The method demonstrates compatibility with Uncertainty Quantification methods that provide opportunities for efficient prediction of a population of nodal responses from sampled data. Overall, the non-destructive and automated nature of the node extraction and response evaluation is promising for its application in qualification and certification of additively manufactured lattice structures."
"‘Just transition’? Conceptual challenges meet stark reality in a ‘transitioning’ coal region in Australia Tobacco Control; Excise Tax; Nicotiana Tabacum â€˜Just transitionâ€™ (JT) is an increasingly popular concept developed by unions and adopted and adapted by academics, environmentalists, government and non-governmental organizations, and international institutions in recognition of the need to address social concerns and inequities emerging from efforts to address environmental problems. It has been noted, however, that â€˜JTâ€™ lacks both conceptual clarity and empirical evidence of its practical applications. This paper examines the â€˜theoryâ€™ and practice of â€˜JTâ€™ by first considering the competing interpretations and conceptual understandings of â€˜JTâ€™ and second, the challenges of realizing a â€˜JTâ€™ in an Australian coal region where transition is occurring. The paper argues that achieving â€˜JTâ€™ requires more than government provisions and interventions and that unions must perform an active part in the â€˜JTâ€™ process through their relations with employers, workers, government, and community. It suggests the lack of clarity within the â€˜JTâ€™ literature may be the conceptâ€™s lasting strength."
"Probing influence factors of implementation patterns for sustainable land consolidation: Insights from seventeen years of practice in Jiangsu province, China Land Consolidation; Agriculture; Cadastres Land consolidation is a key measure in the implementation of agricultural sustainability and has a strategic importance in farmland fragmentation reduction and rural revitalization. In order to understand spatiotemporal patterns of land consolidation implementation and their influences at a large scale, a comprehensive evaluation of 1046 land consolidation projects was conducted in Jiangsu Province, China. The results of this study showed that the construction scale (CS) and investment amount (IA) rose in waves in Jiangsu province during the period 2001-2017, while the newly increased farmland rate (NIFR) continued to decline. Spatial patterns of land consolidation aggregated, whereas the scale and the kernel density of the newly increased farmland area (NIFA) was differentiated in different time periods. In addition, the regional differentiation was significant. The gravity center of CS, IA, and NIFA moved with an overall trend from South Jiangsu to North Jiangsu, and finally stopped at the Li-Xia River plain area in North Jiangsu. The key factors that promoted land consolidation included natural farmland quality and the proportion of the primary industry production in GDP. The potential of NIFA, the farmland production amount, and the income of the financial transferring payment were also important factors. Spatial patterns were initially influenced by natural conditions and were later influenced more significantly by economic and policy conditions. In the future, differentiated land consolidation policy oriented by public involvement should be formulated to improve new frameworks of system implementation, as well as to provide evidence for spatial configuration, district cooperation, policy adjustment, and the systematic improvement of sustainable land consolidation."
"Sustainability in fashion and textiles: A survey from developing country Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing The manufacturing of fashion and textiles involves many processes, which has high detrimental impact on the environment. The production of fashion and textile has been found to be one of the widely environmental polluting sectors. Environmental problems such as water and air pollution, generation of large amount of waste, use of a large amount of toxic chemicals and generation of large amount of wastewater are some of the problems associated with the fashion and textile production. Due to the increased global awareness to save the planet earth, many leading fashion brands have focused to reduce the pollution caused by the production of fashion and textiles. This chapter reviews the concepts of sustainability in fashion and textile production starting from fiber to the garment manufacturing, which can reduce pollution and achieve environmental sustainability. Furthermore, among different approaches taken to achieve environmental sustainability in the most impacting step, fabric chemical processing has been illustrated. The findings of a survey based on Vietnamâ€™s fashion and textile industries are also included in this chapter. We found that the large fashion enterprises are adopting fashion sustainability due to global competition, consumer awareness, and management policy, whereas the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are struggling to survive in the global market due to limited access to funding, lack of skilled people, and lack of consumer awareness."
"GeoAI to implement an individual tree inventory: Framework and application of heat mitigation Heat Islands; Land Surface Temperature; Land Cover Individual Tree Inventory (ITI) is critical for urban planning, including urban heat mitigation. However, an ITI is usually incomplete and costly due to data collection challenges in the dynamic urban landscape. This research developed a methodical GeoAI framework to build a comprehensive ITI and quantify tree species cooling on rising urban heat.The object detection Faster R-CNN model with Inception ResNet V2 was implemented to detect individual trees canopy and seven tree species (Callery pear, Chinese elm, English elm, Mugga ironbark, Plane tree, Spotted gum and White cedar). The land-surface temperature (LST) was derived from Landsat 8 surface reflectance imagery. Two models for ITI were further developed for spatial and statistical analysis. Firstly, an â€˜Individual tree-based modelâ€™ stores the attributes of tree species and its vertical configuration obtained from LiDAR, along with its tree canopy area and surface temperature. Secondly, the â€˜LST zone-based modelâ€™ stores tree canopy cover and building areas in each zone unit. Pearson correlation, global linear regression, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were applied to establish the relationship between tree attributes, building areas (explanatory variables) with local temperature (dependent variable). Results showed that English elm has the highest cooling and least by Mugga ironbark in the study area. GWR results demonstrate that 94% of the LST was explained by tree height and tree canopy area. The LST zone-based model showed that 85% of the LST was explained by the percentage of tree species and buildings. Maps of the local R2 and coefficients of the independent variables provide spatially explicit information on the cooling of different tree species compared to building areas. The implemented GeoAI approach provides important insights to urban planners and government to monitor urban trees with the enhanced Individual Tree Inventory and strategies mitigation plan to reduce the impact of climate change and global warming."
"Bullying in the workplace: a cross-cultural and methodological perspective Mobbing; Incivility; Nurses Whilst research on workplace bullying has substantially increased internationally, there appears to be a contention of whether individuals in hierarchical or individualistic societies are at higher risk of exposure to such behavior. This paper reports an investigation of relative exposure to workplace bullying between the two societies through a survey of Australians and Pakistanis. In so doing, this paper advances the cross-cultural workplace bullying literature in two main ways. First, by examining the methodological issue of equivalence, this paper shows that despite workplace bullyingâ€™s constant meaning across cultures, there are stark differences in employee exposure and tolerance toward it between the assessed cultures. Second, it provides evidence of relative risks of workplace bullying in cross-cultural contexts by revealing a higher risk of exposure to such behavior in a hierarchical rather than an individualistic society. The paper concludes with a detailed discussion of the theoretical and international management practice implications of the research findings."
"A multidimensional framework for disaster recovery: Longitudinal qualitative evidence from Puerto Rican households Temporary Housing; Disaster; Tsunamis Research on household disaster recovery has principally applied quantitative methods to explain, in a correlative way, the speeds at which households recover. Yet there are limited explanatory models of household recovery. This study adopts a qualitative, longitudinal methodology to develop a model of how and why household recovery pathways and speeds are heterogenous. Data was collected over five field visits to Puerto Rico during the first year after Hurricane Maria in 2017. Households mobilise their agency to leverage their assets and recovery priorities to mitigate and/or adapt to four major societal conditions (disaster support; public services; markets; employment and public financial assistance). These societal conditions and household characteristics act as enablers and barriers, which vary over time, and interact to shape householdsâ€™ capacity to recover. The paper also proposes a new definition of disaster recovery, which reflects householdsâ€™ pursuit of recovery needs that do not directly adapt to, reduce or avoid the impacts from disasters."
"Employment types and subjective wellbeing: Evidence from the english longitudinal survey of ageing Subjective Well-Being; Happiness; Life Satisfaction Using seven waves of the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing (ELSA), this chapter examines the impact of labour market attachments on subjective wellbeing (SWB) and quality of life (QoL), during employment and retirement. The authors show that that permanent employees (as opposed to temporary employees) and self-employed (as opposed to paid employees) report higher levels of SWB and QoL throughout their working lives. They argue that this is because permanent employees and the self-employed become more attached to their jobs due to a perceived stronger job-identity fit. However, in retirement, withdrawal from the labour market represents a loss of this identity. Thus, a significant drop in SWB and QoL is observed for permanent employees and self-employed during retirement."
"Re-examination of convergence hypothesis among Indian states in panel stationarity testing framework with structural breaks Income Convergence; Structural Funds; European Union This article examines the conditional income convergence hypothesis for 17 major states in India for the period of 1960â€“2012. Univariate stationarity tests without structural breaks provide evidence against the convergence hypothesis. However, when two or more structural breaks are applied in per capita income series, the incomes of around 11â€“13 states are found to stochastically converge to the national average. This finding supports the convergence hypothesis for the panel as a whole after accounting for two data features, cross-sectional dependence and structural breaks in incomes, using a unified panel stationarity testing framework."
"SENSING, SEIZING, AND RECONFIGURING: UNDERSTANDING WINE TOURISM DEVELOPMENT IN EMERGING ECONOMIES THROUGH THE DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES APPROACH Wine; Hedonic Price Function; Implicit Price In exploring three wine regions located in emerging economies through the lens of the dynamic capabilities framework, this study contributes theoretically and empirically to the wine tourism andwine entrepreneurship literature. Unstructured, face-to-face interviews conducted among 32 Argentinianand Chilean wineries revealed the effects of and the potential to be gained from infrastructure,socioeconomic, and visitor demographic changes. Moreover, sensing and seizing upon potentialopportunities was strongly associated with the above changes. More importantly, preparing for thefuture through reconfiguration or continuous renewal was illustratedâ€”for instance, through a desirefor highly personalized winery experiences. With the increasing globalization of the wine industryand resulting wine tourism alternatives/substitutes, developing dynamic capabilities becomes crucialfor the sustainability of wineries and wine regions. A proposed model based on the researchenables understanding and appreciating opportunities and challenges in a dynamic wine tourismenvironment"
"Addressing conflict within an owners corporation Rise; Bodies Corporate; Housing Management This chapter examines experiences of conflict within the committees of management in multi-owned property. Drawing on qualitative research in Victoria, Australia, the chapter highlights that many of the committee members interviewed lacked awareness of their responsibilities regarding conflict. Issues such as personality clashes, the expense and complexity of litigation, and the time taken in dealing with disputes were common areas of concern. The interview data reveals that committee members are keen to receive assistance with conflict engagement in order to enable them to address these issues effectively. We therefore argue that more effort is required by legislators to adequately educate and guide committee members to deal with conflict in the manner that is required."
"Financial inclusion and its impact on financial efficiency and sustainability: Empirical evidence from Asia Financial Development; Economic Growth; Trade Openness This study examines the trend of financial inclusion in Asia and its impact on financial efficiency and financial sustainability. For this purpose, the study employs a sample of 31 Asian countries during the period spanning from 2004 to 2016. Composite indicators for the three financial dimensions are constructed using principal component analysis (PCA) based on normalized variables. We find that the trends are fluctuating across countries and there is no clear pattern in several cases. The findings are robust to different normalization techniques. Furthermore, the impact of financial inclusion on financial efficiency and sustainability is analysed using Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS). The estimation results indicate that growing financial inclusion negatively affects financial efficiency while favourably influences financial sustainability. The findings hold for the whole sample as well as across the two subsamples of countries with different income levels. This implies that while there are policy synergies between growing financial inclusion and maintaining financial sustainability, proper attention needs to be paid to the side effect of financial inefficiency associated with increasing financial inclusion."
"Accounting and pseudo spirituality in Islamic financial institutions Accounting History; Double-Entry Bookkeeping; Social Responsibility The global financial crisis was followed by calls for a transformation of conventional finance, towards more ethico-aesthetic models. One avenue was to consider the alternative aesthetic of Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). IFIs offer profit-loss sharing (PLS) schemes as a distinctive spiritual alternative to conventional investment products. IFIs ontotheology clashes with the epistemology of modern banking and finance. The accounting for PLS creates tensions due to practical complexity that militates against implementation of the authentic Islamic financial contracts. This paper seeks to identify the role of accounting in IFIsâ€™ practice of interpretation to resolve the struggles that have taken place around the implementation of PLS schemes as a means of spiritual based financial alternatives. We explore how IFIs use accounting in rendering notions of spiritual/prophetic values applicable to practice or how it colludes against their implementation. Our study adopts a qualitative research methodology, framed around 40 interviews and observations of PLS implementation in IFIs in five Muslim countries in Asia and the Middle East, and one in the United Kingdom. We combine the literature on accounting and religion with the ideas/concepts from the literature on religion in organizations, political economy and Islamic law/finance. These perspectives enable us to better reveal how accounting works to reinvent spirituality. In our context we show how accounting mediates the conflicting interests and intentions that arise within the epistemological clashes that happen as the scared/religious strives to take its place in the capitalistic context of the conventional finance industry."
"“Pornography Encouraged Me to Belittle Women”: A Thematic Analysis of Men's Reflections on Violence Against Women and Ceasing Pornography Use Erotica; Porn; Sexual Behavior Within a context of increasingly ubiquitous pornography consumption among men, little is known about men who reject pornography, their motivations to stop consuming it, and their concerns about the treatment of women. In this article, we explore the stated motivations of 124 men who have decided to stop consuming pornography, in order to understand what roleâ€”if anyâ€”concerns about violence against women and gender equality played in their decision. Specifically, we focus on the implications of these findings for future research on the role of men in preventing or addressing harmful attitudes about women through their everyday practices."
"Lysozyme microspheres incorporated with anisotropic gold nanorods for ultrasound activated drug delivery Polyelectrolytes; Microcapsule; Polyanions We report on the fabrication of lysozyme microspheres (LyMs) incorporated with gold nanorods (NRs) as a distinctive approach for the encapsulation and release of an anticancer drug, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). LyMs with an average size of 4.0 Â± 1.0 Âµm were prepared by a sonochemical method and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The LyMs were examined using hydrophobic (nile red) as well as hydrophilic (trypan blue) dyes under confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to obtain information about the preferential distribution of fluorescent molecules. Notably, the fluorescent molecules were accumulated in the inner lining of LyMs as the core was occupied with air. The encapsulation efficiency of 5-FU for LyMs-NR was found to be âˆ¼64%. The drug release from control LyMs as well as LyMs incorporated with NRs was investigated under the influence of ultrasound (US) at 200 kHz. The total release for control LyMs and LyMs incorporated with gold NRs was found to be âˆ¼70 and 95% after 1 h, respectively. The density difference caused by NR incorporation on the shell played a key role in rupturing the LyMs-NR under US irradiation. Furthermore, 5-FU loaded LyMs-NR exhibited excellent anti-cancer activity against the THP-1 cell line (âˆ¼90% cell death) when irradiated with US of 200 kHz. The enhanced anti-cancer activity of LyMs-NR was caused by the transfer of released 5-FU molecules from bulk to the interior of the cell via temporary pores formed on the surface of cancer cells, i.e., sonoporation. Thus, LyMs-NR demonstrated here has a high potential for use as carriers in the field of drug delivery, bio-imaging and therapy."
"Cetacean biodiversity, spatial and temporal trends based on stranding records (1920-2016), Victoria, Australia Bottle-Nosed Dolphin; Cetacea; Stenella Cetacean stranding records can provide vital information on species richness and diversity through space and time. Here we collate stranding records from Victoria, Australia and assess them for temporal, spatial and demographic trends. Between 1920 and 2016, 424 stranding events involving 907 individuals were recorded across 31 Cetacea species from seven families, including five new species records for the state. Seven of these events were mass strandings, and six mother and calf strandings were recorded. Importantly, 48% of the species recorded are recognised as data deficient on the IUCN Red List. The most commonly recorded taxa were Tursiops spp. (n = 146) and Delphinus delphis (common dolphins, n = 81), with the greatest taxonomic richness (n = 24) and highest incidence of stranding events documented within the Otways mesoscale bioregion. We found no seasonal stranding patterns anywhere in the state. While our findings improve understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of cetacean diversity within Victoria, we suggest greater effort to collect demographic data at stranding events in order to better study state-wide patterns through time. We conclude with guidelines for minimum data collection standards for future strandings to maximise information capture from each event."
"Review of drivers and threats to coastal groundwater quality in China Nutrients; Submarines; Radon With rapid socio-economic development, China's coastal areas are among the fastest growing and most economically dynamic regions in the world. Under the influence of climate change and human activities, protecting the quality of coastal groundwater has emerged as one of the key environmental and resource management issues for these areas. This paper reviews (for the first time) groundwater quality data for the coastal basins of China, where over 600 million people live, focussing on key inorganic indicators/pollutants; groundwater salinity, nitrate, fluoride, and arsenic. These pollutants present major water quality issues and are also valuable as indicators of wider processes and influences impacting coastal groundwater quality â€“ e.g. saltwater intrusion, agricultural pollution and release of geo-genic contaminants. We discuss the major drivers causing water quality problems in different regions and assess future trajectories and challenges for controlling changes in coastal groundwater quality in China. Multiple processes, including modern and palaeo seawater/brine migration, groundwater pumping for agricultural irrigation, pollution from agrochemical application, rapid development of aquaculture, urban growth, and water transfer projects, may all be responsible (to different degrees) for changes observed in coastal groundwater quality, and associated long-term health and ecological effects. We discuss implications for sustainable coastal aquifer management in China, arguing that groundwater monitoring and contamination control measures require urgent improvement. The evolution and treatment of coastal groundwater quality problems in China will serve as an important warning and example for other countries facing similar pressures, due to climate change, coastal development, and intensification of anthropogenic activity in coming decades."
"Review of research for two decades for women leadership in higher education around the world and in Vietnam: a comparative analysis Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to find the studies conducted on women leadership in higher education (WLHE) in the past 20 years to understand as to how the trend has changed over the past two decades around the world and particularly in Vietnam for women leaders in higher education institutions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a systematic review of 93 articles published in the past 20 years in WLHE. The articles were classified based on the country of research and the research methods used. Findings: The study concluded that most of the research in WLHE had been done in the USA and Canada, with a dearth of literature on WLHE in Asia, and only six studies so far have been done in Vietnam, with only two studies being done before 2017. Vietnam is gaining importance in research in WLHE may be because of the increased female labour participation rate and growth in the gross domestic product. Practical implications: This study provided some recommendations at the societal, institutional and individual levels, which can help in women empowerment and help women take up the leadership roles. Originality/value: Although a variety of reviews have been conducted focusing on different areas in higher education, there is a small number of literature review studies in the field of women leaders in higher education, especially in Vietnam and Asia. Hence, the current study will add this missing part to the growing body of literature in WLHE."
"Respect@Uni: A feminist insider perspective on respect-based culture change in higher education Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science This article provides feminist insider perspectives on the development and delivery of an innovative respect-based sexual assault and sexual harassment (SASH) prevention initiative in higher education. The initiative is designed specifically to address risk factors in graduate research. It is one of the first of its kind world-wide. Respect and cognate, moderate feminist, concepts are increasingly prevalent as oblique, or stealth, approaches to gender equality in contexts in which doing so openly may be counterproductive. The respect-based initiative examined here addresses the various risk factors that distinguish graduate research from undergraduate education, particularly power imbalances. Adopting a feminist reflective practice methodology, we provide an insider perspective into the multi-layered processes involved in enabling and undertaking institution-wide culture change of this kind. Our critical reflections focus on the stealth approaches adopted during design and delivery, highlighting resistance and receptivity to the initiative and how these were either countered or harnessed. The article provides both practical and theoretical insights into the advantages and limitations of respect-based culture-change. Most notably, it contributes to enhanced understanding of what works in practice, for which there is an urgent need."
"Housing for degrowth: Principles, models, challenges and opportunities Degrowth; Environmental Conflict; Aciclovir â€˜Degrowthâ€™, a type of â€˜postgrowthâ€™, is becoming a strong political, practical and cultural movement for downscaling and transforming societies beyond capitalist growth and non-capitalist productivism to achieve global sustainability and satisfy everyoneâ€™s basic needs. This groundbreaking collection on housing for degrowth addresses key challenges of unaffordable, unsustainable and anti-social housing today, including going beyond struggles for a â€˜right to the cityâ€™ to a â€˜right to metabolismâ€™, advocating refurbishment versus demolition, and revealing controversies within the degrowth movement on urbanisation, decentralisation and open localism. International case studies show how housing for degrowth is based on sufficiency and conviviality, living a â€˜one planet lifestyleâ€™ with a common ecological footprint. This book explores environmental, cultural and economic housing and planning issues from interdisciplinary perspectives such as urbanism, ecological economics, environmental justice, housing studies and policy, planning studies and policy, sustainability studies, political ecology, social change and degrowth. It will appeal to students and scholars across a wide range of disciplines."
"Optimal Solar Plant Site Identification Using GIS and Remote Sensing: Framework and Case Study Solar Farms; Solar Power Plants; Global Positioning System Many countries have set a goal for a carbon neutral future, and the adoption of solar energy as an alternative energy source to fossil fuel is one of the major measures planned. Yet not all locations are equally suitable for solar energy generation. This is due to uneven solar radiation distribution as well as various environmental factors. A number of studies in the literature have used multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to determine the most suitable places to build solar power plants. To the best of our knowledge, no study has addressed the subject of optimal solar plant site identification for the Al-Qassim region, although developing renewable energy in Saudi Arabia has been put on the agenda. This paper developed a spatial MCDA framework catering to the characteristics of the Al-Qassim region. The framework adopts several tools used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), such as Random Forest (RF) raster classification and model builder. The framework aims to ascertain the ideal sites for solar power plants in the Al-Qassim region in terms of the amount of potential photovoltaic electricity production (PVOUT) that could be produced from solar energy. For that, a combination of GIS and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques were employed to determine five sub-criteria weights (Slope, Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), proximity to roads, proximity to residential areas, proximity to powerlines) before perform-ing spatial MCDA. The result showed that â€˜the most suitableâ€™ and â€˜suitableâ€™ areas for the establish-ment of solar plants are in the south and southwest of the region, representing about 17.53% of the study area. The â€˜unsuitableâ€™ areas account for about 10.17% of the total study area, which is mainly concentrated in the northern part. The rest of the region is further classified into â€˜moderateâ€™ and â€˜restrictedâ€™ areas, which account for 46.42% and 25.88%, respectively. The most suitable area for potential solar energy, yields approximately 1905 Kwh/Kwp in terms of PVOUT. The proposed framework also has the potential to be applied to other regions nationally and internationally. This work contributes a reproducible GIS workflow for a low-cost but accurate adoption of a solar energy plan to achieve sustainable development goals."
"The Role of Biochar in Sustainable Agriculture, and Climate Change Mitigation for Sustainable Cities Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Sustainable development is facing a transformation. One solution finding its place as a key strategy in a number of sustainable development goal areas is biochar. Biochar is a geo-engineered bi-product that is similar in appearance to charcoal which differs from charcoal in that the organic biomass waste from which it is created is heated in an enclosed chamber to low temperatures and deprived of oxygen. This paper investigates the latest studies in crop productivity, commercial viabilities, and the socio-economic options of biochar production at a local and international level in the pursuit of sustainability and climate change mitigation. In terms of sustainability the uptake of biochar as a model for sustainable agriculture is steadily gaining momentum due to its agronomic potential for crop yields, organic soil carbon, carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The economic viability of biochar production varies markedly around the world. The most promising opportunities for soil carbon sequestration have derived from voluntary carbon markets and government initiatives such as Australiaâ€™s Emissions Reduction Fund. The scheme promoted the integration of biochar in land use management practices at a farm scale. If biochar is to have a more profound impact on a global scale, then countries need to adopt a sustainable biochar strategy which is universal along with standardised sustainability protocols."
"Hepatitis B vaccine co-administration influences the heterologous effects of neonatal BCG vaccination in a sex-differential manner Heterologous Immunity; Guinea-Bissau; Immunity Introduction: Bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) and hepatitis B (HBV) vaccines are frequently given concomitantly at birth. Neonatal BCG vaccination induces off-target immunological effects. Whether HBV vaccine has immunomodulatory effects is unknown. As off-target effects might vary when vaccines are given simultaneously, this randomised controlled trial aimed to evaluate the influence of neonatal vaccination with BCG and/or HBV on heterologous immune responses. Methods: A total of 185 neonates in Australia were randomised to receive either neonatal BCG-Denmark vaccine, HBV vaccine, both (BCG + HBV group), or none (No vaccine group). In-vitro responses to heterologous stimulants were assessed 7 days after vaccination. The influence of (i) randomisation group and (ii) sex on interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) responses was analysed using linear regression. Results: Overall, BCG vaccination alone or with HBV co-administration reduced IFN-Î³ and MCP-1 responses to heterologous stimulants. HBV vaccination alone did not alter heterologous cytokine responses. In general, males produced more IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± than females. We observed a sex-differential effect in relation to the influence of HBV co-administration on the effect of BCG on heterologous responses. Compared with males in the No vaccine group, males in the BCG + HBV group had lower IFN-Î³ and MCP-1 responses. In contrast, compared with females in the No vaccine group, females in the BCG group had higher IFN-Î³ response and lower MCP-1 responses. Conclusion: Neonatal BCG vaccination resulted in lower cytokine responses to unrelated pathogens. HBV co-administration did not have a significant impact on responses overall but influenced the heterologous effects of neonatal BCG vaccination in a sex-differential manner."
"Hydrogenolysis of Lignin-Derived Aromatic Ethers over Heterogeneous Catalysts Bio-Oil; Catalyst; Guaiacol Global temperature has risen >1 Â°C since the preindustrial era, resulting in well-documented adverse climate impacts including extreme weather (floods, droughts, storms, and heat waves), a rise in sea level accompanying melting polar and glacial ice, and disrupted crop growth. These changes are closely correlated with anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, predominantly arising from the combustion of nonrenewable fossil fuels. Lignin derived from lignocellulose is the second most abundant biopolymer on Earth, and a rich source of renewable aromatic hydrocarbons to replace those currently obtained from fossil resources. Lignin depolymerization by cleavage of C-O and C-C linkages in the biopolymer can be achieved by direct pyrolysis or catalytic transformations, involving oxidation, hydrolysis, or hydrogenolysis reactions. Hydrogenolysis, in which H2 gas (or in-situ generated reactive H species) is supplied to lignin under relatively mild conditions, has attracted significant attention. This Perspective summarizes recent progress in the development of heterogeneous catalysts for the cleavage of C-O linkages in lignin-derived aromatic ethers by hydrogenolysis: It encompasses strategies using H2, hydrogen transfer, and photocatalysis for aromatic monomers production, and the determination of structure-activity relationships and underlying reaction mechanisms."
"Probing influence factors of implementation patterns for sustainable land consolidation: Insights from seventeen years of practice in Jiangsu province, China Land Consolidation; Agriculture; Cadastres Land consolidation is a key measure in the implementation of agricultural sustainability and has a strategic importance in farmland fragmentation reduction and rural revitalization. In order to understand spatiotemporal patterns of land consolidation implementation and their influences at a large scale, a comprehensive evaluation of 1046 land consolidation projects was conducted in Jiangsu Province, China. The results of this study showed that the construction scale (CS) and investment amount (IA) rose in waves in Jiangsu province during the period 2001-2017, while the newly increased farmland rate (NIFR) continued to decline. Spatial patterns of land consolidation aggregated, whereas the scale and the kernel density of the newly increased farmland area (NIFA) was differentiated in different time periods. In addition, the regional differentiation was significant. The gravity center of CS, IA, and NIFA moved with an overall trend from South Jiangsu to North Jiangsu, and finally stopped at the Li-Xia River plain area in North Jiangsu. The key factors that promoted land consolidation included natural farmland quality and the proportion of the primary industry production in GDP. The potential of NIFA, the farmland production amount, and the income of the financial transferring payment were also important factors. Spatial patterns were initially influenced by natural conditions and were later influenced more significantly by economic and policy conditions. In the future, differentiated land consolidation policy oriented by public involvement should be formulated to improve new frameworks of system implementation, as well as to provide evidence for spatial configuration, district cooperation, policy adjustment, and the systematic improvement of sustainable land consolidation."
"Challenges and opportunities of the fourth revolution: a brief insight into the future of food Fog Computing; Network Protocol; Internet of Things By 2050, the global population is projected to be in excess of nine billion people. This will result in an increased burden and stress on the food production systems, particularly in adjustments to several stages of the value chain that will require improvements and/or modifications in their effectiveness such as reducing waste, adapting to climate change, food security, and health. Disruptions such as digital agriculture, digital food, food agility, big data, have been utilized to characterize the changes in the way agro-food systems evolve and function, as well as in the approach they have been analyzed, measured, and monitored. It has been long recognized that the food industry is considered as a data driven enterprise. These characteristics are very important as the food industry becomes global and sustainable. The food industry is currently undergoing significant changes, and with this, challenges are occurring. These challenges are brought about from the food chains, climate changes, and the ability to be resilient in the production of food. Furthermore, health and cultural changes to food are occurring, where the diseases of obesity, diabetes, and aging in the population will continue to change the consumerâ€™s patterns and choices; whereby the consumer will be persuaded to choose and eat healthy and more nutritious foods. Indeed, the cultural awareness and social innovation to prevent food waste and therefore improve food security and sustainability will also prove to further complexities. This short review will briefly discuss some of the forefront issues in food value chains with a focus on using technology."
"Assessing the effectiveness for achieving policy objectives of land consolidation in china: Evidence from project practices in jiangsu province from 2001 to 2017 Land Consolidation; Agriculture; Cadastres Land consolidation (LC) is an important measure taken to increase the quantity and productivity of farmland while reducing land fragmentation and ensuring food security. However, long-term land consolidation project (LCP) practices are rarely analyzed to assess the effectiveness for achieving current policy objectives of LC in China. Taking the practices of LCPs in Jiangsu Province from 2001 to 2017 as a case study, we used the spatial self-related analysis, the consistency analysis, and the redundant analysis (RDA), and found that the construction scale and the investment amount of LC in Jiangsu Province displayed varying trends, and that the newly increased farmland rate is clearly divided into three stages and gradually decreases. The newly increased farmland area, the investment funds, and reserved land resources for farmlands are not spatially synchronized in Jiangsu Province. Only the positive relationship between the LC rate and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) growth rate continue to rise. The earlier stage of land consolidation projects (LCPs)â€™s practices is mainly affected by natural and social factors, and the late stage is mainly affected by economic and strategic factors. Finally, a new implementation scheme framework of LC planning has been proposed. This framework provides reference for top-level design, planning, and management of LC policies at the national level in China and other developing countries."
"Glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) are commonly found in urban streams and wetlands of Melbourne, Australia Algicide; Phosphinothricin; 1-(9-Fluorenyl)Methyl Chloroformate Glyphosate is the most widely-used pesticide for weed control in agriculture and in urban and residential areas. This is the first study to quantify glyphosate and AMPA levels in surface water in Australia from different land uses. Glyphosate and AMPA was measured in surface water from 10 rural streams, 30 urban stormwater wetlands and 9 urban streams located in and around the city of Melbourne, Australia on five occasions between October 2017 and February 2018. Glyphosate and AMPA were present in most of the urban surface water samples. The frequency of detection of glyphosate was 77% in wetlands and 79% in urban streams, whereas it was only detected in 4% of the rural streams. Similarly, AMPA detection was 91% in wetlands and 97% in urban streams, whereas it was only present in 6% of the rural stream samples. In both urban streams and wetlands, the highest average glyphosate concentrations occurred in November (1.8 Â± 2.2 Î¼g Lâˆ’1). Overall, wetlands and streams associated with urban land use are vulnerable to glyphosate contamination. These results highlight the importance of screening for contaminants in urban stormwater to identify the source of pollutants that may end up in aquatic ecosystems and the risks therefrom."
"Review of waste strategy documents in Australia: Analysis of strategies for construction and demolition waste Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management The construction industry in Australia has grown significantly in the past two decades in the wake of population growth, migration and expansion in the tertiary education industry. The growing population has necessitated extensive property development, better public transport and improved infrastructure. To achieve all of this, construction activities have been on the rise; resulting in significant growth in construction and demolition (C&D) waste generation. However, the management of C&D waste has presented issues that have proven impact on the Australian society, environment and economy. Therefore, this review study is conducted to investigate how C&D waste is dealt in eight jurisdictions of Australia. This study reviewed the strategies recommended in waste strategy documents in these jurisdictions. Particularly, the study reviewed waste recycling and recovery targets, illegal dumping and stockpiling, extended producer responsibility, the definition of waste versus resource; use of C&D recycled waste and energy from waste extraction. The results of this review have provided an insight into the approach taken in the Australian context to deal with C&D waste stream."
"Tropical forest canopies and their relationships with climate and disturbance: results from a global dataset of consistent field-based measurements Leaf Area Index; Canopies; Canopy Reflectance Background: Canopy structure, defined by leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FCover) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), regulates a wide range of forest functions and ecosystem services. Spatially consistent field-measurements of canopy structure are however lacking, particularly for the tropics. Methods: Here, we introduce the Global LAI database: a global dataset of field-based canopy structure measurements spanning tropical forests in four continents (Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas). We use these measurements to test for climate dependencies within and across continents, and to test for the potential of anthropogenic disturbance and forest protection to modulate those dependences. Results: Using data collected from 887 tropical forest plots, we show that maximum water deficit, defined across the most arid months of the year, is an important predictor of canopy structure, with all three canopy attributes declining significantly with increasing water deficit. Canopy attributes also increase with minimum temperature, and with the protection of forests according to both active (within protected areas) and passive measures (through topography). Once protection and continent effects are accounted for, other anthropogenic measures (e.g. human population) do not improve the model. Conclusions: We conclude that canopy structure in the tropics is primarily a consequence of forest adaptation to the maximum water deficits historically experienced within a given region. Climate change, and in particular changes in drought regimes may thus affect forest structure and function, but forest protection may offer some resilience against this effect."
"What are the impacts of living in social housing? New evidence from Australia Neighborhood Effects; Public Housing; Poverty In this paper, we apply statistical matching methods to a national longitudinal dataset of Australians facing housing insecurity to estimate the impacts of social housing on employment, education, health, incarceration and homelessness. We find social housing in Australia provides an important `safety netâ€™ protecting people from homelessness. However, at least in the short run, individuals in social housing have similar outcomes in terms of employment, education, physical and mental health, and incarceration to other comparable individuals not in social housing. These are the first estimates of causal impacts of social housing, simultaneously estimating impacts on a range of shelter and non-shelter outcomes highlighted as important by the broader social housing literature. They also provide an interesting contrast with the existing US estimates. These results are potentially due to strict targeting of individuals into social housing and that they represent the average effect across individuals who may experience substantially different impacts."
"Digitalizing agriculture extension service in Ethiopia: A design-reality gap analysis Cell Phone Use; Market Information; Agriculture Recent research shows that information systems (IS) developed to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and their farming practices have experienced mixed levels of success. As such, an evaluation of contextual factors and the socio-technical requirements of agricultural IS is needed to fully understand the challenges of digitalizing agriculture extension information service (AEIS) in developing countries. We examine the socio-technical design and reality features of an AEIS that was intended to digitalize AEIS in Ethiopia. Conceptually, we use Bass and Heeks's (2011) design-reality framework to unravel the changing socio-technical design requirements and, empirically we draw from a qualitative case study of an existing AEIS. The findings show gaps between the designed artefact and the lived experiences of stakeholders' activities, and the need to shift from a simplistic approach that focuses on providing access to digital content and devices to a balanced approach that addresses socio-technical requirements while digitalizing the public AEIS."
"A novel improved Harris Hawks optimization algorithm coupled with ELM for predicting permeability of tight carbonates Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines; Cone Penetration Test; Artificial Neural Network Tight carbonate reservoirs appear to be heterogeneous due to the patchy production of various digenetic properties. Consequently, the permeability calculation of tight rocks is costly, and only a finite number of core plugs in any single reservoir can be estimated. Hence, in the present study, a novel hybrid model constructed by combination of the improved version of the Harris Hawks optimisation (HHO), i.e., IHHO, and extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed to predict the permeability of tight carbonates using limited number of input variables. The proposed IHHO employs a mutation mechanism to avoid trapping in local optima by increasing the search capabilities. Subsequently, ELM-IHHO, a novel metaheuristic ELM-based algorithm, was developed to predict the permeability of tight carbonates. Experimental results show that the proposed ELM-IHHO attained the most accurate prediction with R2 = 0.9254 and RMSE = 0.0619 in the testing phase. The result of the proposed model is significantly better than those obtained from other ELM-based hybrid models developed with particle swarm optimisation, genetic algorithm, and slime mould algorithm. The results also illustrate that the proposed ELM-IHHO model outperforms the other benchmark model, such as back-propagation neural nets, support vector regression, random forest, and group method of data handling in predicting the permeability of tight carbonates."
"Assessing block-level sustainable transport infrastructure development using a spatial trade-off relation model Pavements; Road Maintenance; Roads Increasing quantity and quality of roads are pathways to sustainable road infrastructure development. Understanding quantity-quality relations of road sustainability is critically required for strategic decision making. However, few knowledge are available about assessing quantity-quality relations of road sustainability from a perspective of spatial disparities. Here, we developed a Spatial Trade-Off Relation (STOR) model for assessing road quantity-quality trade-off relations at 42,425 blocks in Western Australia (WA). First, a sustainable road infrastructure index (SRII), including quantity and quality phases, was developed regarding stakeholder requirements and using multiple spatial methods to examine block-level road sustainability. Next, quantity-quality trade-off relations for road sustainability was investigated using a diminishing marginal utility approach. Further, spatial disparities of quantity-quality trade-offs were assessed through the spatial clustering based identification of hotspots and cold spots in trade-offs. Finally, contributions of the road quantity-quality interaction to economic development were estimated with the consideration of non-linear and geographically local characteristics of the associations using a generalized additive model and geographically weighted regression. We found three stages of the quantity-quality relations of road sustainability, including the increasing, marginal, and negative returns. The increasing return revealed the simultaneous growth of quantity and quality in outer and remote regions, and marginal and negative returns were primarily located in major cities. In addition, regional disparities of the trade-offs were found from the identified blocks, towns and villages, where quantity and quality were spatially clustered, for informing priorities of future strategic decisions. We also found that the contribution of road quality was about three times the contribution of quantity to resident income. This study demonstrated that efforts regarding regional quantity-quality trade-offs were required to achieve global sustainable infrastructure development goals."
"Recent advance in MXenes: New horizons in electrocatalysis and environmental remediation technologies Transition Element; Sodium-ion Batteries; Ion Storage A strong electrocatalytic activity of the MXenes nanomaterials (NMs) has gained a lot of concentration as cutting edge materials in a variety of electrocatalytic devices in a broad range of industrial uses. In recent years, the production and utilization of the MXenes NMs as an electrocatalysts has progressed, with more than 50 distinct variants found and used. We reviewed and discussed in this article the latest detail progress in the synthesis, selected properties and potential applications of the MXenes as an electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), overall water splitting, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) etc. We will also discuss the numerous approaches for increasing MXenes electrocatalytic activity for target products. At the end, we will also talk about the present obstacles and future suggestions for the MXenes as HER, ORR, OER, NO2RR and CO2RR electrocatalysts."
"The impact of immigration on housing prices in Australia Labour Market Effects; Emigration And Immigration; Immigration Policy In recent years, Australia has experienced high rates of immigration. We investigate the effect that this has had on housing prices at the postcode level. The endogeneity of immigrant inflows is accounted for using the Bartik shift-share approach. Using data from the censuses in 2006, 2011, and 2016, we find that an immigrant inflow of 1% of a postcode's population raises housing prices by around 0.9% per year. As a result, Australian housing prices would have been around 1.1% lower per annum had there been no immigration. The size of this effect is broadly consistent with that found for other countries. The effects of immigration on housing prices were larger in the more recent part of the period examined and strongest in the states of New South Wales and Victoria, and the cities of Melbourne and Adelaide. Chinese and Indian immigrant groups are shown to have a strong positive influence on prices."
"A systematic review protocol investigating community gardening impact measures Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems Existing community gardening research has tended to be exploratory and descriptive, utilising qualitative or mixed methodologies to explore and understand community garden participation. While research on community gardening attracts growing interest, the empirical rigour of measurement scales and embedded indicators has received comparatively less attention. Despite the extensive body of community gardening literature, a coherent narrative on valid, high quality approaches to the measurement of outcomes and impact across different cultural contexts is lacking and yet to be comprehensively examined. This is essential as cities are becoming hubs for cultural diversity. Systematic literature reviews that explore the multiple benefits of community gardening and other urban agriculture activities have been undertaken, however, a systematic review of the impact measures of community gardening is yet to be completed. This search protocol aims to address the following questions: (1) How are the health, wellbeing, social and environmental outcomes and impacts of community gardening measured? (2) What cultural diversity considerations have existing community garden measures taken into account? Demographic data will be collected along with clear domains/constructs of experiences, impacts and outcomes captured from previous literature to explore if evidence considers culturally heterogeneous and diverse populations. This will offer an understanding as to whether community gardening research is appropriately measuring this cross-cultural activity."
"Beyond Formal Ethics Reviews: Reframing the Potential Harms of Sexual Violence Research Sexual Assault; Participation; Intimate Partner Violence Given the recent surge of research about sexual violence, it is timely to revisit the role of ethics in this field. This article examines two key frameworks which govern ethics in sexual violence research: institutional risk management and trauma discourse. While recognising the importance of these frameworks, we argue that they share a narrow conceptualisation of the potential harms of sexual violence research. Drawing on the legacy of decades of feminist research on sexual violence, we call for a deeper engagement with ethical and epistemological questions of knowledge, positionality and power. We argue that researchers need to consider the broader social and political contexts that shape survivorsâ€™ lives and experiences of disclosure in undertaking ethical research. Sexual violence researchers must also consider the potential harms of their research on marginalised communitiesâ€“from questioning who is included in research, to the implications of the responses to violence advocated for. Utilising insights from feminist, critical and intersectional traditionsâ€“and reflections on our own experiences as sexual violence researchersâ€“we argue for ethical considerations to extend beyond risk management and medicalised trauma frameworks."
"Selective N2/H2O adsorption onto 2D amphiphilic amorphous photocatalysts for ambient gas-phase nitrogen fixation Catalyst; Cobalt Phosphide; Water Splitting The gas-phase Haberâ€“Bosch process has been the main industrial source of ammonia over the last century. However, its reliance on high temperature and high pressure for enormous energy input emits greenhouse gas to air and is associated with the depletion of fossil fuels. The need of the hour is to replace this method with environmentally sustainable processes, among which, photocatalytic nitrogen reduction has attracted much attention. In this work, we report a low cost, scalable manufacturing of gas-phase photoreactors for nitrogen reduction under ambient conditions based on 2D amorphous molybdenum oxysulfides, i.e. MoS2+x-MoO3-y composites. They show excellent nitrogen reduction efficiencies of âˆ¼141 Î¼mol/g/h with remarkably stable performance. The amphiphilic MoS2+x and MoO3-y composites selectively chemisorb and activate N2 and H2O molecules, respectively, and enable multiple photodriven redox reactions towards NH3 evolution. Such photoreactors for ambient ammonia synthesis provides a potentially feasible route towards next-generation gas-phase industrial ammonia production."
"Application of high-frequency ultrasound standing waves for the recovery of lipids from high-fat dairy effluent Acoustic Levitation; Acoustics; Bessel Beam Effect of high-frequency ultrasonication was examined on wastewater of a cheese manufacturing plant. Tests were carried out at two frequencies (500 kHz and 1 MHz) and two temperatures (22 and 40 Â°C). Samples were subjected to different energy densities; 7.5, 30.2, 60.5 and 121.0 J/mL at 500 kHz and 7.9, 31.7, 63.4 and 126.8 J/mL at 1 MHz to observe the creaming and recovery of lipid. These energy densities correspond to 30, 120, 240 and 480 s of sonication. Sonication was performed using a single plate transducer and reflector system at 40 W to create standing wave to coalesce and flocculate lipid globules. Recovery was higher at 40 Â°C after 480 s of sonication at both frequencies (77% at 500 kHz and 75% at 1 MHz). The lowest recovery of 47% was observed at 500 kHz and 22 Â°C at all applied energy densities. Changes in particle size and turbidity in the bottom aliquot indicated that high-frequency ultrasound caused coagulation and aggregation and settling of colloidal particles. Increase in particle size was observed to be highest at 1 MHz, 40 Â°C and 480 s of sonication. These results confirm that high-frequency ultrasound standing wave technology can be used to recover lipid from high-lipid dairy wastewater including that from cheese manufacturing."
"University buildings: The push and pull for sustainability Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Universities are a key stakeholder in our built environment with buildings in many major cities around Australia and the world. Due to their primarily urban locations, size and number of staff and students, universities and their activities are a significant contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. Increasingly universities both in Australia and globally are looking for ways to improve their sustainability outcomes. This recognizes that higher education institutions can do more to help in the transition to a low-carbon future, but also that by adopting sustainability initiatives, universities help reduce operating costs and facilitate healthier and more productive staff and students. This chapter explores the role of universities and their sustainability initiatives including their challenges of servicing complex stakeholders in a transition to a low-carbon future. After discussing relevant policies and rating tools, five key examples that go significantly beyond minimum performance requirements from prominent Australian universities are presented. Evident from the examples is that there continues to be no one-size-fits-all approach for universities to become more sustainable. It will require complex considerations of the requirements of the university anticipated future needs as well as a wide-ranging evaluation of the most appropriate pathways forward. Ultimately, it is encouraging to see key universities engaging more seriously with improving sustainability outcomes, not only in Australia but also globally. Universities have the opportunity to not just improve sustainability of their facilities, but to also demonstrate to their hundreds of thousands of students and staff how the built environment can be designed to benefit both the environment and the occupants."
"Listening to Voices from the Margins: Transforming Environmental Education Intersectionality; Feminism; Social Location In the past, women, queer, Indigenous and disabled people, as well as race, class and body size issues, have been overlooked in most environmental education programs through being subsumed into the notion of â€œuniversalised people,â€ the â€œnorm.â€ However, people in each of these marginalised groups has a distinctive contribution to make to environmental education, as a form of anti-oppressive resistance, which needs to be foregrounded. In this chapter I problematize the relative silencing of queer theory and theorizing in environmental education and discuss the contributions that queer(y)ing perspectives bring to environmental education. In particular, I discuss some possibilities for new directions for environmental education where queer ecopedagogies and research, intersectionality and assemblages are used to listen to, and work with, â€œqueerâ€ voices."
"Dinuclear orthometallated gold(I)-gold(III) anticancer complexes with potent in vivo activity through an ROS-dependent mechanism Antineoplastic Activity; Auranofin; Heterocyclics Increasingly explored over the last decade, gold complexes have shown great promise in the field of cancer therapeutics. A major obstacle to their clinical progression has been their lack of in vivo stability, particularly for gold(III) complexes, which often undergo a facile reduction in the presence of biomolecules such as glutathione. Herein, we report a new class of promising anticancer gold(I)â€“gold(III) complexes with the general formula [XAuI(Î¼-2-C6F4PPh2)(Îº2-2-C6F4PPh2)AuIIIX] [X = Cl (1), Br (2), NO3 (3)] which feature two gold atoms in different oxidation states (I and III) in a single molecule. Interestingly, gold(I)â€“gold(III) complexes (1â€“3) are stable against glutathione reduction under physiological-like conditions. In addition, complexes 1â€“3 exhibit significant cytotoxicity (276-fold greater than cisplatin) toward the tested cancer cells compared to the noncancerous cells. Moreover, the gold(I)â€“gold(III) complexes do not interact with DNA-like cisplatin but target cellular thioredoxin reductase, an enzyme linked to the development of cisplatin drug resistance. Complexes 1â€“3 also showed potential to inhibit cancer and endothelial cell migration, as well as tube formation during angiogenesis. In vivo studies in a murine HeLa xenograft model further showed the gold compounds may inhibit tumor growth on par clinically used cisplatin, supporting the significant potential this new compound class has for further development as cancer therapeutic."
"Precariously placed: housing affordability, quality and satisfaction of Australians with disabilities Social Support; Social Care; Direct Payments Access to adequate, safe, secure, accessible and affordable housing is a fundamental human right and one stipulated in the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Australian adults with disabilities experience housing disadvantage including homelessness, poor-quality housing and housing unaffordability; however, we lack a comprehensive comparison of the housing circumstances of people with and without disabilities and differences by impairment type. We analysed data from a nationally representative sample of 11,394 working-aged Australians collected in 2011. We found that people with disabilities experienced disadvantage across all housing indicators, and people with intellectual and psychological disabilities fared worst. These findings suggest that there is a housing crisis for Australians with disabilities, which may intensify with the introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There is a need to develop long-term housing solutions that promote independence, are accessible and affordable, and that consider location and neighbourhood context."
"Shifting practices: How the rise of rooftop solar PV has changed local government community engagement Household Energy; Energy; Smart Meters Australian local governments develop and deliver a range of community engagement programmes designed to reduce household-based greenhouse gas emissions. This article draws on practice theory to analyse how these programmes have changed over time in response to the rapid deployment of a domestic renewable energy technology: rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV). After outlining the practice â€œlensâ€ used to analyse these practices, we draw on empirical research to examine traditional forms of climate change community engagement practice including meanings of leadership adopted by local governments. We note how these play out in the form of ambitious community-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets that favour technological responses to climate change which in turn has favoured the rise of rooftop solar PV, and how community engagement practices have changed as a result. We find that Australian local government climate change community engagement practices have experienced three distinct forms of performance. The first, what might be termed â€œtraditionalâ€ climate change community engagement practices, rely upon individuals acting out of adherence to pro-social environmental values. The second highlights the technology of rooftop solar PV with its associated pro-individual motivations, such as financial benefit. The third form, which is currently emerging, positions local governments as â€œdisruptorsâ€ of centralised energy systems mobilising rooftop solar PV amongst actors currently excluded from the solar revolution, such as renters, low income households and community energy groups. In extending the meanings of rooftop solar PV uptake beyond financial benefits to a shared response to climate change, local governments become active agents in mobilising community energy transitions."
"Household coping behavior and its contribution to resilience to global macroeconomic shocks in Vanuatu and Solomon Islands Climate Change; Decision to Migrate; Small Islands This paper examines the resilience of households in Vanuatu and Solomon Islandsâ€”two small island developing states in Melanesia renowned for their vulnerabilitiesâ€”to the adverse effects of global macroeconomic shocks. The focus is on the spike in international food and fuel prices in 2008 and the subsequent shock to global demand, known as the Global Economic Crisis (GEC). Using a unique retrospective cross-section survey, the results show that experience of these shocks was widespread across urban and rural areas. Households with more education, access to income-generating activitiesâ€”particularly in the informal sectorâ€”and greater wealth were best placed to withstand a deterioration in their well-being, measured as a fall in self-reported disposable income. Households also employed a variety of coping strategies in response to the shocks. Local food gardens and informal insurance are seen as key safety nets in times of stress, yet neither provided full insurance from the shocks. Some households, particularly in urban areas, employed harmful coping strategies, such as reducing spending on health, education, and food. While potentially effective in withstanding a temporary fall in disposable income, these responses are likely to weaken overall resilience and leave households vulnerable to future shocks."
"Sustainability strategy and blockchain-enabled life cycle assessment: a focus on materials industry Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things Sustainable development, especially with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), has been a priority of corporations. Nevertheless, processes which are required to deliver both changes and impact to create a sustainable organization have been slow and challenging. The purpose of this research is first to explore the extent and nature of eco-sustainability policy and strategy implementation of Materials Industry Group (MIG) companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The analysis shows that strategy is the core element for organizational sustainable development and strategy needs to be implemented at the enterprise-wide level and aligned with other dimensions within the McKinsey Seven Sâ€™s (7Sâ€™s) framework. The capabilities of life cycle assessment (LCA) that provides a holistic assessment of environmental impacts of products, from upstream and downstream perspectives, is under-explored. The case companies used in this research find it challenging to implement LCA. This research adds an additional dimension to the existing framework, suggesting the possibilities of adopting blockchain technology in strategizing sustainability strategy. Blockchain in the systems of the framework can be used in LCA to support sustainability and help organizations to achieve their targeted SDGs."
"A Framework of Facilitators and Barriers to Career Adaptability: Migrant Hotel Workers During COVID-19 Career Adaptability; College Students; Social Cognitive Career Theory We examine internal and external factors that build or thwart the career adaptability resources of migrant hotel workers. Drawing on qualitative data at two points in time over a 12-month period during COVID-19, results show that while some migrant workers changed roles and exited hotels, for most, job changes were a shorter-term, separation phenomenon, with migrants transitioning back to their employer within a year. Psychological, social, and human capital resources facilitated career adaptability, while psychoemotional support from managers and peers fostered the confidence of temporary migrants, and facilitated positive affect, which was integral to their openness to exploring alternate hospitality careers. Inhibitors to career adaptability included a lack of agency among temporary migrants, and career entrenchment of mid-career permanent migrants. Our model provides a fine-grained, holistic understanding of the antecedents of career adaptability, enriching career construction theory by clarifying the contexts that drive career adaptability in the evolving, COVID-19 context."
"Evaluating changes in GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways in early life following prenatal stress and postnatal neurosteroid supplementation Pregnanolone; Tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone; Animals Background: A correct balance of activity of the GABA and glutamate systems is vital for optimal neurodevelopment and general CNS function, and the dysregulation of this balance has been implicated in a number of neurological conditions. Maternal exposure to stressors is known to have long lasting, deleterious impacts on neurobehaviour, and similarly, results in dysregulation of inhibitory and excitatory pathways in the offspring. The current study aimed to examine effects on these pathways in a guinea pig model of prenatal stress and to elucidate whether increased neuroprotective support by postnatal neurosteroid supplementation would ameliorate adverse outcomes. Methods: Prenatal stress was achieved by exposing pregnant guinea pigs dams to a strobe light for 2hrs/day on gestational age (GA) 50, 55, 60 and 65. Dams were allowed to spontaneously deliver (~GA70) and pups were orally administered either allopregnanolone analogue, ganaxolone (5 mg/kg/day in 45% cyclodextrin), the translocator protein (TSPO) agonist, emapunil (XBD173; 0.3 mg/kg/day in 1% tragacanth gum) or vehicle on postnatal days (PND) 1â€“7. Hippocampal samples were collected at PND30 to measure relative mRNA expression of components involved in the inhibitory GABAergic pathway and exctitatory glutamatergic pathway by real-time PCR. GABAergic interneurons were quantified by assessing immunohistochemical protein expression of markers parvalbumin, calbindin and calretinin. Results: mRNA expression of GABAergic pathway components at one week of age indicated immature expression profiles of the GABAA receptors as well as decreased GABA synthesis and transport suggesting reduced extrasynaptically-mediated tonic inhibition. Expression profiles of the pathways examined evolved between one week and one month of age but an imbalance in inhibitory/excitatory components persisted. The allopregnanolone analogue ganaxolone offered some protection against excitotoxicity in female hippocampus, however neurosteroid supplementation with ganaxolone or emapunil were unable to fully correct the GABAergic/glutamatergic imbalance observed following prenatal stress. Conclusion: Prenatal stress leads to programmed lasting effects on the major inhibitory and excitatory pathways in the guinea pig brain that continue evolving between the equivalent of early and late childhood. Neurosteroid therapies particularly improved outcomes in females. Further studies are required to identify additional therapeutic targets that are able to fully restore imbalances in the excitatory and inhibitory systems, which may act to prevent development of childhood behavioural disorders."
"Negentropy for the anthropocene; Stiegler, Maori and exosomatic memory Gilbert Simondon; Individuation; Bernard Stiegler Exosomatic memory is a crucial phase in the evolution of humanity because it enables learning to take place across groups and generations rather than exclusively through lived experience or one on one transmission. Exosomatic memory is the attribution of knowledge to objects, such as art or writing, which allows epistemology to be transmitted beyond the individual to subsequent generations of people. Exosomatic memory is the key to the transmission of culture and knowledge, beyond the individual who learns exclusively from personal experience. This places technologies such as writing and art in a key position for the education of culture and knowledge. Stiegler develops these ideas, following Martin Heidegger, Leroi-Gourhan and Derrida from the Palaeolithic to the contemporary. Maori use of natural objects as exosomatic transmission of intergenerational learning exceeds the technological enframing of modernity outlined by Heidegger. For indigenous peoples, exosomatic memory is cultural, technological and ecological. Stiegler argues that the impact of cybernetics on knowledge production is accelerating the technological enframing of knowledge (2018). Consequently, information technologies are leaving the human mind behind, in passive receptivity rather than dynamic creativity. The prefrontal cortex is slower than the internet, exacerbating a widening lag in active understanding, in favour of passive absorption. Alienation and epistemological entropy are trapping us in climate change and the anthropocentric Capitalocene. Maori insight may cut the Gordian knot and sidestep the alienation and determinism of technological modernity."
"Efficacy Study of Fault Trending Algorithm to Prevent Fault Occurrence on Automatic Trampoline Webbing Machine Rolling Bearing; Rotating Machinery; Failure Analysis Nowadays, fault diagnostics is widely applied under Industry 4.0 to reduce machine maintenance costs, improve productivity, and increase machine availability. However, fault diagnostics are mostly post-mortem. When the fault is identified, it is already too late because damages have been done to the product and machine. This paper compares the efficacy of several signal data processing techniques for detecting faults that are about to occur. Our aim is to find an efficient way to predict the fault before it occurs. A continuous wavelet transform synchrosqueezed scalogram was found to be most suitable for this purpose, but it is difficult to apply. A novel procedure is proposed to count the number of pulses in the synchrosqueezed scalogram. A new method for detecting the trend from the pulse counts is then developed to predict the fault before it happens. The procedure and method are illustrated with experimental data collected while running an automated double-thread trampoline webbing machine."
"Cultural Marxism: far-right conspiracy theory in Australia’s culture wars Radical Right; Populist; Right-Wing Populism As a conspiracy promoted by the far-right, Cultural Marxism has gained ground over the past quarter century. In its dominant iteration, the US-originating conspiracy holds that a small group of Marxist critical theorists have conspired to destroy Western civilisation by taking over key cultural institutions. Yet what does such a conspiracy look like in a transnational contextâ€“and how are such conspiracy theories adapted for local use? In this article, we trace Cultural Marxismâ€™s use and function in Australiaâ€™s recent culture wars, asking when, where and in what contexts the conspiracy is invoked in the Australian political and media landscape. Our analysis examines the ways in which Cultural Marxism has moved from the â€˜fringeâ€™ to the â€˜mainstreamâ€™, revealing the porous nature of divisions on the contemporary Australian right as well as differences between â€˜oldâ€™ and â€˜newâ€™ right. We pay particular attention to the localised use of the conspiracy in the â€˜Safe Schoolsâ€™ controversy of 2016â€“2017, whereby Cultural Marxist tropes were imbued with local concerns about sexuality and gender issues. The article provides an important illustration and analysis of the ways in which transnational conspiracy theories and tropes of the far-right can be translated, adapted and used in different national contexts."
"Microwave hydrothermal carbonization of rice straw: Optimization of process parameters and upgrading of chemical, fuel, structural and thermal properties Hydrothermal Carbonization; Hydrochars; Carbon The process parameters of microwave-induced hydrothermal carbonization (MIHTC) play an important role on the hydrothermal chars (hydrochar) yield. The effect of reaction temperature, reaction time, particle size and biomass to water ratio was optimized for hydrochar yield by modeling using the central composite design (CCD). Further, the rice straw and hydrochar at optimum conditions have been characterized for energy, chemical, structural and thermal properties. The optimum condition for hydrochar synthesis was found to be at a 180 Â°C reaction temperature, a 20 min reaction time, a 1:15 weight per volume (w/v) biomass to water ratio and a 3 mm particle size, yielding 57.9% of hydrochar. The higher heating value (HHV), carbon content and fixed carbon values increased from 12.3 MJ/kg, 37.19% and 14.37% for rice straw to 17.6 MJ/kg, 48.8% and 35.4% for hydrochar. The porosity, crystallinity and thermal stability of the hydrochar were improved remarkably compared to rice straw after MIHTC. Two characteristic peaks from XRD were observed at 2Î¸ of 15Â° and 26Â°, whereas DTG peaks were observed at 50-150 Â°C and 300-350 Â°C for both the materials. Based on the results, it can be suggested that the hydrochar could be potentially used for adsorption, carbon sequestration, energy and agriculture applications."
"Experimental demonstration of an indoor optical wireless communication system with a waveform index modulated uplink Communication Systems; Optical Wireless; Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) The optical wireless communication (OWC) technology has been widely studied to provide high-speed wireless connections in indoor environments. Compared with the downlink, the uplink faces more restrictions, such as the stringent power, complexity, and cost requirements. In this Letter, we propose a waveform index modulated OWC uplink with each waveform seen as a virtual transmitter. Extra data is transmitted via the index of selectively activated virtual transmitter, and the OWC uplink speed can be improved whilst achieving similar bit-error-rate (BER) performance. The waveform index modulated uplink is experimentally demonstrated in a near-infrared OWC system. Results show that up to 15 Gb/s data rate is achieved with the proposed waveform index modulated uplink, which increases the data rate significantly with similar power and BER."
"In their own voice: The role of the Shape of the Australian Curriculum: The Arts Paper Writers in ensuring equitable access to quality Arts education in Australia Numeracy; Education Policy; Literacy This paper examines the personal and professional experiences of the five arts leaders who co-wrote the foundation document for Australiaâ€™s first national curriculum in the Arts. Their personal and professional backgrounds, which were explored during in depth interviews, drove the complex collaborative process that informed the first iteration of the Australian Curriculum: The Arts. Though each couched their responses in the context of their background and arts discipline, they shared an awareness of the important role of the Arts in providing the analytical tools for children and young people to identify and subsequently challenge social injustice. The findings, which are presented as a group narrative using a Narrative Inquiry approach, reveal how the five arts leadersâ€™ individual lived experience, disciplinary experience and expertise, and commitment to collaborative leadership informed their approach. It was one driven by their shared belief that all Australian students, regardless of their background, are entitled to a quality arts education."
"Exploring inequities in housing affordability through an analysis of walkability and house prices by neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Cities are socio-spatially patterned, yet few researchers have explored the association between walkability and house prices by neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage, highlighting issues about housing affordability, equity, and liveability. We aimed to determine whether walkability and house prices differed by neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage. To test this, we used linear regression models of house prices stratified by quintiles of neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage at the suburb level in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia on walkability and its components (street connectivity, dwelling density, and destination access), and public transit access. Walkability was positively associated with house prices. In the stratified regressions, destination accessibility was associated with higher house prices whilst having poor access to transit was negatively associated with house prices. The association between walkability and house prices was weakest for the most disadvantaged areas, suggesting that houses in these areas were more affordable due, in part, to a lack of amenity. Future planning could redress the relationship between walkability and house prices by making new areas walkable. Increasing densities in outer suburban areas would improve destination and transit access, and in established areas, inclusionary zoning policies could help ensure accessibility to social and affordable housing in amenity-rich areas redressing built environment inequities."
"Oxidative Damage to Mitochondria Enhanced by Ionising Radiation and Gold Nanoparticles in Cancer Cells Gold Nanoparticles; Nanocrystal; Radiation-Sensitizing Agents Gold nanoparticles (AuNP) can increase the efficacy of radiation therapy by sensitising tumor cells to radiation damage. When used in combination with radiation, AuNPs enhance the rate of cell killing; hence, they may be of great value in radiotherapy. This study assessed the effects of radiation and AuNPs on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cancer cells as an adjunct therapeutic target in addition to the DNA of the cell. Mitochondria are considered one of the primary sources of cellular ROS. High levels of ROS can result in an intracellular state of oxidative stress, leading to permanent cell damage. In this study, human melanoma and prostate cancer cell lines, with and without AuNPs, were irradiated with 6-Megavolt X-rays at doses of 0â€“8 Gy. Indicators of mitochondrial stress were quantified using two techniques, and were found to be significantly increased by the inclusion of AuNPs in both cell lines. Radiobiological damage to mitochondria was quantified via increased ROS activity. The ROS production by mitochondria in cells was enhanced by the inclusion of AuNPs, peaking at ~4 Gy and then decreasing at higher doses. This increased mitochondrial stress may lead to more effectively kill of AuNP-treated cells, further enhancing the applicability of functionally-guided nanoparticles."
"Assessing the workforce adaptive capacity of seaports to climate change: an Australian perspective Climate Change; Mobile Money; Storm Surges This paper explores the adaptive capacity of the Australian port workforce and its preparedness to manage the likely impact of climatic shifts and extreme weather events. Qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted across three case-ports in which a wide range of adaptive capacity elements, including systems and processes, skills and knowledge and organizational culture and norms, were explored. In total, 15 interviews and three focus groups were organized, totaling 69 participant-hours of rich qualitative data. Findings suggest that the ports seem to have established a variety of systems and processes to cope with and manage the impacts of extreme weather events. Although acknowledging the need for continuous improvement, the management staff were confident about the effectiveness of current systems and processes to tackle the potential threats from extreme weather events. The general view was that additional adaption measures are not required to specifically deal with the impacts of extreme weather. However, it was also acknowledged that strengthening of adaptive capacity could be enhanced by mainstreaming climate considerations into existing risk evaluation, workforce management, and operational systems. Whilst sustainability issues are becoming increasingly important to port businesses, it is argued that ports should integrate climate change adaptation as part of their wider risk management strategies, as well as their sustainable development agenda to update and guide the actions, behaviours, and practices of the port workforce."
"Exploring how perceptive differences impact the current public transport usage and support for future public transport extension and usage: A case study of Melbourne's tramline extension Public Transport; Motor Vehicles; Passengers Although users' perceptions on public transport have been long identified by researchers as important factors in travel mode choice, limited studies exist to examine the impact of perceptions on support for future public transport extension and subsequent usage. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the effect of perceived experience of public transport use on usersâ€™ support for the future extension and usage of public transport services. An analysis of survey data on usersâ€™ perceptions of current public transport usage and support for a future tramline extension and usage in Melbourne, Australia, shows that expected tramline extension usage frequency is significantly related to whether users support the extension. The modal shift after the tramline extension will most likely come from current train and bus users. Further, it was observed that factors such as travel time to weekly activity, travel costs to weekly activity, mode of nearest public transport to home, walk time to nearest public transport, the existence of a tramline in the suburb and feelings of safety on trams need to be given due consideration when planning for extension of tramlines. The findings from our study are valuable resources for planners and decision makers involved in investment in public transport services."

"Corporate ownership, efficiency and performance under state capitalism: Evidence from China Firm; Anti Corruption Campaign; Bank Loans This paper studied the relationship between business performance and the ownership structure of firms focusing on Chinese state owned enterprises (SOEs) using a firm level panel data set of China from 1999 to 2011. By classifying all firms into different types based on their ultimate controlling shareholders, we found that SOEs in general underperform in the marketplace than private enterprises. However, among the SOEs in our sample, the SOEs controlled by central government outperformed all types of firms because they offered the highest asset turnover ratio and lowest business administration ratio by receiving favourable government treatment. We conclude that firm ownership type and work efficiency are the main factors that influence the differences in firm performance. In particular, the performance of SOEs controlled by central government is greatly determined by the degree of government intervention, which is referred to as State Capitalism."
"Cultures of gendered violence: An integrative review of measures of attitudinal support for violence against women Rape; Sexual Assault; Offenders National and international research has repeatedly identified the specific gendered nature and context of womenâ€™s victimisation of violence, whereby women are disproportionately victims of sexual and partner violence and overwhelmingly at the hands of known male perpetrators. As such, violence against women warrants a targeted and substantial focus, within overall violence reduction and prevention efforts. In the Australian policy context, there is an emerging and influential focus on attitudes towards violence against women as key targets for primary prevention and as foci for monitoring progress in reducing this violence. The Australian National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women Survey was established to estimate community-level understanding of and attitudes towards violence against women. It has arguably evolved into an important instrument both for monitoring shifts in Australiansâ€™ knowledge and attitudes, as well as for directing primary prevention efforts. The purpose of this article is to provide an integrative review in relation to one of the key dimensions of the national community attitudes survey: violence supportive attitudes (see Webster et al., 2014). Here, we seek to identify patterns in defining and measuring attitudes that support violence against women, as well as advance the field by offering recommendations for progressing the measurement of violence supportive attitudes in Australia in the future."
"Toward sustainable environmental quality: Identifying priority research questions for Latin America PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs The Global Horizon Scanning Project (GHSP) is an innovative initiative that aims to identify important global environmental quality research needs. Here we report 20 key research questions from Latin America (LA). Members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) LA and other scientists from LA were asked to submit research questions that would represent priority needs to address in the region. One hundred questions were received, then partitioned among categories, examined, and some rearranged during a workshop in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Twenty priority research questions were subsequently identified. These research questions included developing, improving, and harmonizing across LA countries methods for 1) identifying contaminants and degradation products in complex matrices (including biota); 2) advancing prediction of contaminant risks and effects in ecosystems, addressing lab-to-field extrapolation challenges, and understanding complexities of multiple stressors (including chemicals and climate change); and 3) improving management and regulatory tools toward achieving sustainable development. Whereas environmental contaminants frequently identified in these key questions were pesticides, pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors or modulators, plastics, and nanomaterials, commonly identified environmental challenges were related to agriculture, urban effluents, solid wastes, pulp and paper mills, and natural extraction activities. Several interesting research topics included assessing and preventing pollution impacts on conservation protected areas, integrating environment and health assessments, and developing strategies for identification, substitution, and design of less hazardous chemicals (e.g., green chemistry). Finally, a recurrent research need included developing an understanding of differential sensitivity of regional species and ecosystems to environmental contaminants and other stressors. Addressing these critical questions will support development of long-term strategic research efforts to advance more sustainable environmental quality and protect public health and the environment in LA.

"Chip formation characteristics of selective laser melted Ti–6Al–4V Machining; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); High Speed Machining In this research work, chip formation characteristics of selective laser-melted (SLM) Tiâ€“6Alâ€“4V in both â€˜as builtâ€™ and â€˜heat treatedâ€™ conditions are studied and compared with conventional wrought Tiâ€“6Alâ€“4V. Machined chips and partially deformed chips were collected from turning trials and quick stop experiments to study the nature of chip formation characteristics. Chip formation studies reveal that, â€˜segmentedâ€™ or â€˜saw toothâ€™ chips were produced during machining of SLM Tiâ€“6Alâ€“4V materials. The tendency to form segmented chips was higher in SLM Tiâ€“6Alâ€“4V materials as compared to conventionally produced wrought Tiâ€“6Alâ€“4V. In addition, cracks were found to be a common feature in primary and secondary deformation zones of SLM Tiâ€“6Alâ€“4V chip samples, illustrating that periodic crack initiation is the root cause of â€˜saw toothâ€™ formation during machining. Furthermore, the tendency to form build up edge during machining was less in SLM Tiâ€“6Alâ€“4V materials compared to wrought Tiâ€“6Alâ€“4V, influencing the machined surface finish."
"The behavioral additionality effects of a tax incentive program on firms’ composition of R&D investment Firm; Subsidies; Tax Incentives This paper investigates the behavioral additionality effects of a unique high- and new- technology enterprise (HNTE) program in China. The program provides a reduced corporate income tax to certificated HNTEs. By distinguishing research expenses from development costs, we examine if the tax incentive program affects firmsâ€™ composition of R&D investment, based on a sample of Chinese listed firms. The results indicate that the tax incentive program encourages firms to focus more on development than on research. The effects are also found to be heterogeneous among the first-time, repeated, and one-time certification users. The results imply that tax incentives prompt firms to invest in short-term development opportunities with promising private returns. Conversely, they are less likely to stimulate risky research projects with potential high rates of social and long-term economic returns. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the behavioral additionality effects for innovation policy evaluations and better policy designs."
"Hydration and strength evolution of ternary-blend high-volume fly ash concretes Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali The increase of carbon emissions due to the annual growth of portland cement (PC) production has promoted research into the development of sustainable green concrete using a range of readily available industrial waste materials. The present study is focused on developing two high-volume fly ash (HVFA) concretes with cement replacement levels of 65% (HVFA-65) and 80% (HVFA-80). The required lime for both HVFA concrete mixtures was initially determined and the optimized mixture designs identified, based on the 28-day compressive strength, by varying the low-calcium Class F fly ash-hydrated lime composition. The optimized concrete mixtures achieved a compressive strength of 53 and 40 MPa (7.69 and 5.80 ksi) for HVFA-65 and HVFA-80 concretes, respectively. The early-stage strength development is dependent on the matrix produced in the specific HVFA concrete, which is itself dependent on the number of unreacted fly ash spheres. The increase of fly ash and hydrated lime dosage in HVFA concrete increases the rate of hydration of the C3A and C4AF phases, but decreases the hydration of the C3S phase, which resulted in lower early-age strength development than occurs in PC concrete. It was noted that the initial setting time of HVFA concretes increase with an increase of fly ash content. However, addition of hydrated lime accelerates the hydration and decreases the final setting time for HVFA concretes."
"Durable Antibacterial and Antifungal Hierarchical Silver-Embedded Poly(vinylidene fluoride- co-hexafluoropropylene) Fabricated Using Electrospinning Chitosan; Electrospinning; Nanofibers The aim of this study was to demonstrate the use of electrospinning to produce hierarchical fibrous structures for antibacterial and antifungal applications. Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are produced in situ within an electrospinning solution with the help of a solvent acting as a reducing agent. Ag NP-filled poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) fibers were produced by electrospinning this solution. The collected fibers were placed on top of a porous anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) template, and the setup was heated above the glass-transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer. Heating above Tg enabled the polymer to flow into the porous channels of the AAO template and led to the fabrication of hierarchical PVDF-HFP fibers filled with Ag NPs. The microstructure of the samples revealed that the nanostructures were formed uniformly on the surface of the fibers. The wettability of the samples was measured by determining the contact angle, and it was revealed that the wettability of hierarchical fibrous structures was higher than the wettability of PVDF-HFP-filled Ag NPs. Lastly, the antimicrobial activity results revealed that both PVDF-HFP fibers filled with Ag NPs and the hierarchical PVDF-HFP fibers filled with Ag NPs exhibited inhibition against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. The antibacterial and antifungal performance for the samples was determined, and it was found that the hierarchical fibrous structures showed the highest antibacterial and antifungal performance against MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans in comparison to the neat PVDF-HFP fibers and PVDF-HFP fibers filled with Ag NPs. We also demonstrated that these fibers can be strongly antibacterial and antifungal after a number of usages. This may be attributed to the slow and long-lasting release of silver ions from the electrospun fibers. Hierarchical PVDF-HFP filled with Ag NPs showed the lowest relative bacterial viability (less than 5%) against MRSA in all three cycles. The relative bacterial and fungal viability against P. aeruginosa and C. albicans was determined to be less than 15%. These findings demonstrate that the fabricated antibacterial and antifungal fibers show tremendous promise for applications such as air filtration, water treatment, protective clothing, and so forth."
"Characterization of Novel Moss Biomass, Bryum dichotomum Hedw. as Solid Fuel Feedstock Biofuel; Nannochloropsis; Chlorella Sorokiniana Due to the overuse of natural gas and petroleum in Bangladesh, the excessive greenhouse gas (GHG) emission continuously worsens the countriesâ€™ air quality. To resolve this environmental concern as well as determine the sustainable bioenergy sources, research on biomass for biofuel production has been highlighted recently. Therefore, this study emphasized to identify a novel biomass for solid fuel generation as well as designed a pilot-scale biofuel production scheme. The study endeavoured to characterize the bioenergy properties of a novel wetland moss species, B. dichotomum Hedw., collected from rainforest of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), Bangladesh. Current study also presented the morphological edifice and elemental composition through scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Gross and net calorific values of moss were determined through bomb calorimeter by standard method, and they were 10.77 and 9.35 MJ kgâˆ’1, respectively. Moisture content, ash content, volatile matter, fixed carbon, and bulk density were characterized on air-dried basis through standard ASTM methods, and the outcomes were 10.74%, 55.3%, 28.29%, 5.67% and 44.09 kg mâˆ’3, respectively. Other physical bioenergy parameters were biomass characteristics index 3936 kg mâˆ’3, energy density 0.475 GJ mâˆ’3 and fuel value index 5.07. Apart from that, experimental results revealed carbon element 56.6%, oxygen content 42.1% on dry weight basis and O/C ratio 0.74 in sample biomass."
"The impact of state regulation in a sphere of education on sustainable development of national economy Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Education is a core element of the Sustainable Development Concept. It is not only because of the declaration of SDG 4 within the 2030 Agenda but also its embeddedness in other goals, targets, and indicators. Thus, the study aims to generalize approaches to define the relationship between the efficiency of the strategy of sustainable development of the national economy and state regulation of education. The research is accomplished for 14 Central and Eastern European countries (2006-2016) using the combination of principal components method and parametric method of stochastic frontier analysis in the software package STATA 11 and FRONTIER 4.1. As a result, the empirical proofs of the strong and adequate link between the efficiency of the sustainable development strategy of the national economy and state regulation of education are identified. The technical efficiency indexes were also calculated that allowed forming three clusters for Central and Eastern European countries distributed by the level of state regulation of education and efficiency of sustainable development strategy implementation. It helps to distinguish the main measures to reform the state regulation of education in Ukraine considering the experience of Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic, countries that proved to be the leaders in a sphere of sustainable development strategy implementation. The recommendations for further improvements in educational policies were defined. For instance, effective and sustainable state regulation of education should focus on decentralizing education, developing private-public partnerships, stimulating adult education development, etc."
"Factors influencing the concentration of fecal coliforms in oysters in the river Blackwater Estuary, UK Bacteroidales; Seashore; Fecal Bacterium Contamination of water systems can not only entail high risks to human health but can also result in economic losses due to closure of beaches and shellfish harvesting areas. Understanding the origin of fecal pollution at locations where shellfish are grown is essential in assessing associated health risks-as well as the determining actions necessary to remedy the problem. The aim of this work is to identify the species-specific source(s) of fecal contamination impacting waters overlying the shellfisheries in the Blackwater Estuary, East Anglia, UK. Over a twelve-month period, water samples were taken from above the oysters and from a variety of upstream points considered to be likely sources of fecal microorganism, together with oyster samples, and the number of fecal streptococci and E. coli were determined. Transition from low to high tide significantly decreased the concentration of fecal streptococci in waters overlying the oyster beds, indicative of a freshwater input of fecal pollution in oyster bed waters. In 12 months, the number of E. coli remained constant throughout, while fecal streptococci numbers were generally higher in the winter months. Analyses of upstream samples identified a sewage outfall to be the main source of E. coli to the oyster beds, with additional fecal streptococci from agricultural sources. The findings may assist in developing approaches for assessing the risks to shellfishery industries of various fecal inputs into an estuary, which could then help local governmental authorities address the problem."
"Mechanosensing by Piezo1 and its implications for physiology and various pathologies Animals; Ion Channels; Mechanotransduction Piezo1 is a mechanosensitive ion channel with essential roles in cardiovascular, lung, urinary, and immune functions. Piezo1 is widely distributed in different tissues in the human body and its specific roles have been identified following a decade of research; however, not all are well understood. Many structural and functional characteristics of Piezo1 have been discovered and are known to differ greatly from the characteristics of other mechanosensitive ion channels. Understanding the mechanisms by which this ion channel functions may be useful in determining its physiological roles in various organ systems. This review provides insight into the signalling pathways activated by mechanical stimulation of Piezo1 in various organ systems and cell types. We discuss downstream targets of Piezo1 and the overall effects resulting from Piezo1 activation, which may provide insights into potential treatment targets for diseases involving this ion channel."
"Using the capability approach to evaluate energy vulnerability policies and initiatives in Victoria, Australia Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Energy vulnerability is a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-specific phenomenon that poses a challenge for equity in energy transition policies. The Capability Approach (CA) is a normative framework focused on peopleâ€™s opportunities and freedoms, used to address dimensions of social justice. Whereas the CA has been used to assess and measure conditions of poverty, exclusion and inequality, its application to evaluate policies is rare. Building on work that establishes being able to heat the home adequately as a secondary capability towards being able to lead a healthy life, this narrative review maps the conditions and processes that shape this secondary capability in Victoria, Australia. It also evaluates local policies and initiatives aimed at addressing energy vulnerability. The map identifies structural, geographical and cultural phenomena and feed-back loops and exposes a hierarchy of capabilities for vulnerable households that need to be satisfied. The policy review finds that current efforts focus on mitigating inequalities in resources with little evidence for outcomes in security or transformative agency. Future initiatives may give more attention to the satisfaction of the tertiary capability of being able to live in an energy efficient dwelling, customise solutions to the multitude and range of conditions and acknowledge the need of warmth throughout the home."
"Trace metals concentration in vegetables of a sub-urban industrial area of bangladesh and associated health risk assessment Soil; Cadmium; Average Daily Intake Trace metals contamination of vegetables in the sub-urban industrial area of Bangladsh are increasing day by day. The mostly consumed vegetables like tomato (Lycopersicon lycopersicum), spinach (Spinacea oleracea), bean (Lablab purpureus), brinjal (Solanum melongena), potato (Solanum tuberosum), cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var botrytis), cabbage (Brassica oleracea var cupitata), and radish (Raphanus sativus) were collected from industrial area. Trace metals arsenic (As), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) were measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The descending order of trace metals followed the order of Zn>Mn>Pb>Cd>As. The results revealed that every vegetable contained the highest concentration of Zn range from 15 Â± 1.4 to 50 Â± 4.0 mg/kg fresh weight. Trace metals in vegetables exceeded the permissible level of FAO and WHO standard. The non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were estimated on the basis of estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI) and target carcinogenic risks (TRs). The EDI values of all trace metals were below the maximum tolerable daily intake (MTDI). Total target hazard quotient (TTHQ) were greater than 1, indicated that if people consume these types of vegetables in their diet, they might pose risk to these metals. Finally, the total cancer risks (TRs) values were 6.4 Ã— 10âˆ’3 for As and 8.7 Ã— 10âˆ’5 for Pb which were greater than threshold value of USEPA (10âˆ’6), indicating that the consuming inhabitants of these vegetables are exposed to As and Pb with a lifetime cancer risk."
"Coastal flooding risk assessment using a GIS-based spatial multi-criteria decision analysis approach Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Coastal areas are expected to be at a higher risk of flooding when climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) is combined with episodic rises in sea level. Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM), mostly based on statistical and machine learning methods, has been widely employed to mitigate flood risk; however, they neglect exposure and vulnerability assessment as the key components of flood risk. Flood risk assessment is often conducted by quantitative methods (e.g., probabilistic). Such assessment uses analytical and empirical techniques to construct the physical vulnerability curves of elements at risk, but the role of people's capacity, depending on social vulnerability, remains limited. To address this gap, this study developed a semiquantitative method, based on the spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (SMCDA). The model combines two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, and factors triggering coastal flooding in Bandar Abbas, Iran. It also employs an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model to weight indicators of hazard, exposure, and social vulnerability components. Under the most extreme flooding scenario, 14.8% of flooded areas were identified as high and very high risk, mostly located in eastern, western, and partly in the middle of the City. The results of this study can be employed by decision-makers to apply appropriate risk reduction strategies in high-risk flooding zones."
"Centering gender on the agenda for environmental education research Educational Research; Relationality; Ecofeminism The environmental education movement developed in the 1970s at the same time as the environment movement, the feminist movement and the ecofeminist movement. However, while environmental education feels a close affinity with the environment movement the relationship with the (eco)feminist movement in environmental education research has been less than robust. Although there was some feminist environmental education research in the 1990s and 2000s, until the two recent special issues of The Journal of Environmental Education there had been a prolonged, even a deafening, silence around gender, eco/feminism and environmental education research. This article traces the history of feminist environmental education research across this and other environmental education research journals to argue that it is time for gender to be much higher on the agenda of environmental education researchers and of journals if we are to better achieve gender equality and more fully address the climate emergency within the field."
"Durable superomniphobic surface on cotton fabrics via coating of silicone rubber and fluoropolymers Hydrophobicity; Wetting Transition; Fabrication Performance textiles that protect human from different threats and dangers from environment are in high demand, and the advancement in functionalization technology together with employing advanced materials have made this an area of research focus. In this work, silicone rubber and environmentally friendly fluoropolymers have been employed to explore superomniphobic surface on cotton fabrics without compromising comfort much. It has been found that a cross-linked network between the rubber membrane and the fluoropolymers has been formed. The surface appearance, morphology, handle, thickness and chemical components of the surface of cotton fabrics have been changed. The coated fabrics showed resistance to water, aqueous liquid, oil, chemicals and soil. The comfort of the coated fabrics is different to uncoated cotton fabrics due to the existence of coated layers on the surface of cotton fabrics. This work would benefit the development and design of the next generation of performance textiles with balanced performance and comfort."
"Technological, nutritional and sensory properties of pasta fortified with agro-industrial by-products: a review Noodles; Pasta; Flour Reducing food waste is a priority to move towards more sustainable food systems. Since agro-food by-products are often rich in healthy compounds, such as fibre, phytochemicals, protein, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals, the waste valorisation could move through their transformation into ingredients useful for the formulation of functional foods. Pasta is a staple food widely consumed all over the world representing an optimal carrier for nutrients delivery. The incorporation of ingredients of a high added value obtained by agro-industrial by-products in pasta can improve its nutritional value and provides several health benefits. At the same time, the inclusion of new ingredients could modify the physical, chemical and textural properties determining the change of the organoleptic characteristics of fortified pasta, affecting its acceptability. Thus, the preparation of new pasta formulations with high nutritional properties, good technological and sensory characteristics represents a challenge for the food industry."
"Experts’ Perceptions of the Management and Minimisation of Waste in the Australian Construction Industry Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management Effective waste management has become a crucial factor in Australia because, from 1996 to 2015, the population increased by 28%, while Australiaâ€™s annual waste increased by 170%. In the period 2018â€“2019, Australia generated 27 Mt of construction demolition waste (44% of all waste). Although 76% of this waste is recycled, there has been a 61% increase in the rate of waste since 2006â€“2007. Therefore, minimising waste and prioritising waste management are necessary to build a circular economy. This study aims to identify the current waste minimisation perceptions in the Australian construction industry. A semi-structured interview was conducted with 50 industry experts focusing on four sectors (design/planning, building information modelling (BIM), material logistics, and prefabrication). The data were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively (Severity index). The result disclosed that the designers are the first contributor to waste minimisation, followed by the material suppliers/manufacturers. It is revealed that subjective attitude and the personal reluctance to exercise waste mitigation strategies are crucial. The outcome also indicated that BIM has the potential to minimise waste significantly. Overall, 15 key points were highlighted to consider for waste minimisation, and a conceptual framework was proposed. Therefore, identifying waste managementâ€™s current practices and the responsibility of industry personnel will help minimise waste and bring sustainable development."
"Modest ratios of fast food outlets to supermarkets and green grocers are associated with higher body mass index: Longitudinal analysis of a sample of 15,229 Australians aged 45 years and older in the Australian National Liveability Study Obesity; Farmers' Markets; Grocery Stores Food purchasing decisions are made within the context of the range of options available, yet most epidemiological studies focus upon single outlet types. Ratios of fast food outlets to supermarkets and green grocers were linked to addresses of 15,229 adults in the 45 and Up Study at baseline (2006â€“2008) and follow-up (2009â€“2010). Compared to having no fast food outlet but having healthy food outlets within 3.2 km from home, multilevel growth curves revealed that relative exposure>25% fast food outlets were associated with 0.36â€“1.19 kg/m 2 higher BMI (p<0.05). These associations were consistent as people aged. No associations were observed for food outlets<0.8 km."
"Patterns of historical and future urban expansion in Nepal Sleuths; Cellular Automaton Model; Urbanization Globally, urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented rate at the cost of agricultural and forested lands in peri-urban areas fringing larger cities. Such land-cover change generally entails negative implications for societal and environmental sustainability, particularly in South Asia, where high demographic growth and poor land-use planning combine. Analyzing historical land-use change and predicting the future trends concerning urban expansion may support more effective land-use planning and sustainable outcomes. For Nepal's Tarai region-a populous area experiencing land-use change due to urbanization and other factors-we draw on Landsat satellite imagery to analyze historical land-use change focusing on urban expansion during 1989-2016 and predict urban expansion by 2026 and 2036 using artificial neural network (ANN) and Markov chain (MC) spatial models based on historical trends. Urban cover quadrupled since 1989, expanding by 256 km2 (460%), largely as small scattered settlements. This expansion was almost entirely at the expense of agricultural conversion (249 km2). After 2016, urban expansion is predicted to increase linearly by a further 199 km2 by 2026 and by another 165 km2 by 2036, almost all at the expense of agricultural cover. Such unplanned loss of prime agricultural lands in Nepal's fertile Tarai region is of serious concern for food-insecure countries like Nepal."
"Curating inclusive cities through food and art Place; Heritage Tourism; Tourist Experience Flavours of Glenroy (2013â€“4) was an action research project where artists imagined mobile edible gardens as a way to connect and engage with locals through project presentation and execution. As a socially engaged art project, it focused on developing ways to connect the mobile, diverse and transforming community of Glenroy, Victoria, Australia. The transnational, Australian dream suburb, reflecting the fluid and globalizing conditions of our cities, was emphasized through the strategy of growing and distributing plants using a mobile system that aligned with the mobility and diversity of the suburb. The project emphasized how social relations, encouraged through art, has the capacity to transform public spaces, providing a platform to introduce new voices and narratives of a community and encourage inclusive participation in sustainable citizenship."
"The Political Economy of E-Government Innovation and Success in Korea Open Government; Transparency; E-Governance Over the past two decades, Korea has established and maintained itself as one of the worldâ€™s leaders in e-government. This study explains why this has happened by using a political economy analysis. Qualitative case study methods have been utilized to enable sensemaking of Koreaâ€™s successful e-government development trajectory. Five complementary factors have been identified to account for this success. They are the legacy of the developmental state in defining governmentâ€™s role in economic development; the impact of democratization on the nature of e-government services and provision; the shock impact of the Asian Financial Crisis that led to accelerated e-government development; the creation and maintenance of an effective policy process; an effective system of public administration. These factors have provided both the drivers and context for sustained successful e-government development. While the Korean experience supplies lessons for other countriesâ€™ e-government development, the whole model is not replicable as it is based on the particularities of Korean development."

"Mandatory? Voluntary? A Discussion of Corporate Environmental Disclosure Requirements in China Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative In the face of an increasing Environmental crisis, the Chinese government has released a series of guidelines and regulations related to corporate environmental disclosure in recent years. However, the distinction between mandatory and voluntary disclosure, when considering China, is still problematic and a clear understanding of what is required by law and what is purely voluntary does not appear to exist in many studies of the region. As most researchers apply a simplistic classification, this leads to confusion and contradictions between studies. This paper outlines the complexities of the regulatory system in China and attempts to provide direction on how the term voluntary disclosure should be used when studying corporate environmental reporting in China."
"Evolving governance and contested water reforms in Australia's Murray Darling Basin Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water This paper explores the ways water governance adapts to changing social values and political imperatives by examining the case of water policy reforms in Australia's Murray Darling Basin. Over more than two decades, Australia's water reforms have explicitly aimed to promote ecological sustainability and economic efficiency, attempting to balance pro-market, micro-economic reforms with broader social and sustainability goals. Despite the formality of Australia's intergovernmental agreements, water reforms have been expensive and heavily contested, experiencing many implementation challenges. However, water market reforms have generally been regarded as successful, enabling the reallocation of water for environmental and extractive uses, contributing to flexibility and adaptive capacity. Recognising that discursive contestation is central to policy development, the paper documents the way the reform processes have attempted to broker compromises between three competing policy paradigms-national development, economic rationalism and environmentalism. These inherent tensions resulted in prolonged contests for influence over policy directions long after formal statements of policy intent by Governments. Given that climate change is driving the need for water governance reforms, the paper looks to what lessons can be learnt about the redesigns of meta-governance arrangements, including through structured commitments to independent audits and evaluations that can provide the feedback needed for adaptive governance and policy learning."
"Regional drought risk assessment in the Central Highlands and the South of Vietnam Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China This study contributes to a proof-of-concept comprehensive drought risk assessment for Vietnam by (i) incorporating drought exposure and vulnerability based on specific socio-economic conditions of the regions; and (ii) using satellite data including World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Space-based Weather and Climate Extremes Monitoring (SWCEM) products, and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Enhanced U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Global Data for drought hazard assessment. Drought risk assessment which incorporated hazard, exposure and vulnerability components was conducted for 27 provinces from four administrative areas in Vietnam. Drought Hazard Index (DHI) was derived using the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), the Vegetation Health Index (VHI), and surface soil moisture (SSM) to take into account the impact of both meteorological and agricultural drought. Drought Exposure Index (DEI) and Drought Vulnerability Index (DVI) were calculated using statistical data of land use and socio-economic characteristics obtained from Vietnamâ€™s statistical yearbooks. By combining DHI, DEI and DVI, a composite Drought Risk Index (DRI) was derived for drought risk assessment in the selected provinces for 2020. It was shown that the highest at-risk provinces were in the Mekong River Delta, the agricultural production centre of Vietnam. The South East regions were less impacted by drought compared to other regions. The proposed comprehensive approach to drought risk assessment in Vietnam has potential to contribute to improving drought preparedness and resilience of communities at-risk."
"Supply chain recovery challenges in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic Disruption; Supply Chain Disruptions; Dual Sourcing The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the fragility of global supply chains arising from raw material scarcity, production and transportation disruption, and social distancing. Firms need to carefully anticipate the difficulties during recovery and formulate appropriate strategies to ensure the survival of their businesses and supply chains. To enhance awareness of the issues, this research aims to identify and model recovery challenges in the context of the Bangladeshi ready-made garment industry. A Delphi-based grey decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology was used to analyze the data. While the Delphi method helped identify the major supply chain recovery challenges from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the grey DEMATEL approach helped categorize the causal relationships among these challenges. Of the 23 recovery challenges finalized, 12 are causal challenges. The study's findings can assist decision-makers in developing strategic policies to overcome the recovery challenges in the post-COVID-19 era."
"“Bitch, You Got What You Deserved!”: Violation and Violence in Sex Buyer Reviews of Legal Brothels Prostitution; Sex Workers; Sexual In this article, we use feminist critical discourse analysis to examine online brothel reviews (148 reviews and 2,424 reply posts) of sex buyers in the context of debates surrounding harm minimization. Our findings show that sex buyers actively construct and normalize narratives of sexual violation and violence against women in licensed brothels through their language, referencing objectification, unsafe sex practices, and, in more extreme cases, rape to create a sense of community with other punters. Through this analysis, we challenge existing assumptions about harm minimization in systems of prostitution, which are legalized or fully decriminalized."
"Administration of crowdfunding at Australian universities Crowdfunding; Lending; Fintech Crowdfunding offers a new funding model for research activities at universities. It combines fundraising with public engagement and an entrepreneurial spirit. While universities might be expected to show enthusiasm for the possibilities of crowdfunding, support has not been widespread in Australia. Only a small number of Australian universities have provided active support for crowdfunding of research activities. Interviews with academics and administrators from two Australian universities with a history of providing strong support for research crowdfunding show that clear vision and firm leadership are required to overcome organizational inertia. Universities need to provide space for academics and administrators to innovate, try new approaches, and even fail as they learn whether crowdfunding works for them. Peer support and organized training can help academics as they seek to build an audience via social media engagement. Universities can also provide analysis of campaign progress and, in some cases, funding to support campaigns. The article concludes with best-practice advice for universities that wish to encourage research crowdfunding supported by a framework that describes a continuum of support, ranging from an outright ban to benign neglect to strong support for this new activity."
"Failing to live up to the promise: the politics of equal pay in ‘new’ workplace and industrial relations institutions Political Representation; Quotas; Parliament Workplace and industrial relations regulations are key sites for policy intervention to address Australia's gender pay gap, which, at 15.3 per cent, is almost as large as it was in 1997. In both the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) and the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 (Cth) the goal of equal pay has a more central place than it did in predecessor legislation. In particular, the Fair Work Act has the potential to deliver more gender-equitable wage structures through addressing systemic gender-based undervaluation at the industry level. Adopting a feminist institutional approach this article examines equal pay policy in the operations of workplace and industrial relations regulation to ask why, despite some recent successes, this potential appears unlikely to be realised."
"Endangered species face an extra threat: susceptibility to the invasive pathogen Austropuccinia psidii (myrtle rust) in Australia Puccinia Psidii; Myrtus; Rust Disease Austropuccinia psidii (myrtle rust) is an invasive fungus native to South America that infects the young growing tissues of species in the Myrtaceae family, one of the dominant plant families in Australia. To date, 360 native species from 49 genera have been found to be susceptible in Australia, but the vast majority remain untested (81%). The aim of this study was to test a range of plant species whose susceptibility status remains unknown, including endangered species, species with a large distribution overlap with A. psidii and species from a genus that has not been previously tested. Different sub-species and provenances were also tested to assess for intra-specific differences. Of the 24 tested species/sub-species, 18 (including 12 endangered) were found susceptible to A. psidii to varying degrees (including the first species record within Triplarina being susceptible), while one presented a hypersensitive reaction and six were resistant. The most susceptible species were the critically endangered Melaleuca megalongensis, and the endangered Eucalyptus copulans, E. parvula, E. scoparia and Melaleuca irbyana. No significant differences in intraspecific susceptibility were found between sub-species or provenances. We suggest that the susceptible species we have identified will be vulnerable to infection in their native ranges in the future, if they have not already become infected. For highly susceptible species, A. psidii should be considered as a major additional threat and appropriate control measures incorporated into existing threatened species plans. Monitoring of susceptible speciesâ€™ populations in the wild and seed collection for seed banking are vital steps for ensuring their conservation."
"The effect of smoke derivatives and carbon utilisation on symbiotic germination of the endangered pterostylis despectans (Orchidaceae) Germination; Tulasnella; Cephalanthera Orchids are highly dependent on exogenous nutritional sources and mycorrhizal associations to survive, particularly when challenged by extreme environmental stress such as bushfires that contribute significantly to its decline in nature. In this study, the effect of smoke derivatives and carbon utilisation was explored to improve germination and seedling establishment of an Australian endangered orchid, Pterostylis despectans (Lowly Greenhood) and its mycorrhizal fungi. Stored seeds were germinated in vitro with peloton-isolated fungal isolates with varying concentrations of smoke water (0-1.0 mL L-1) to simulate fire and sucrose as the carbon source (10 g L-1). Smoke water significantly increased germination, with advanced protocorms and robust seedlings produced. Sucrose inhibited germination such that protocorms and leafing was absent with sucrose inclusion. Fungal isolates were highly variable on its germination efficacy and tolerance to smoke water, highlighting the importance of fungal diversity and supports research-based conservation strategies to circumvent environmental challenges."
"Attitudinal support for violence against women: What a population-level survey of the Australian community can and cannot tell us Intimate Partner Violence; Violence Against Women; Domestic Violence Violence against women (VAW) is a serious and prevalent problem globally. Societal-level norms, practices and structures are among the factors contributing to it, sometimes referred to collectively as representing â€œcultures of supportâ€ for VAW. Understanding factors contributing to these cultures is important for prevention, but remains the subject of debate. Population-level surveys of attitudes toward VAW are one means to strengthen this understanding. Although there are a number of such surveys internationally, scholarly research based on secondary analysis of data, at least from surveys in high-income countries, is scant. This article reports on new analyses of the Australian National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women survey to explore its potential to further empirical and conceptual understanding of cultures of support for VAW. To facilitate this, a scale to measure attitudes toward VAW was developed post hoc from the survey (the Violence Supportive Attitudes, or VSA-18, Scale). Subsequent analyses investigate the relationship between this scale and relevant demographic factors and a measure of attitudinal support for gender equality (GE). The GE measure, place of birth, employment and occupation, generation, education and sex contribute to variance in the VSA-18 Scale. Findings are discussed in the context of theoretical debates and directions for future research."
"Rethinking the study of ""religion"" and media from an existential perspective Study of Religion; Religious Studies; Theology The broadening of the concept of religion from a substantive, anthropological defini tion to a more cultural, functional definition has enabled expansion of the study of media, technology and religion into a much wider field of social phenomena. It has Ben argued that this expansion has been so broad and unbounded that the more ap propriate question in this field of study is no longer ""What is religion?"", but ""What isn't religion?""This paper contends that the time is ripe to set aside a dualistic lens of religion and secular and look instead at embodie human reality as incorporating not only material, empirical and instrumental characteristics but also tanscendental, metaphysical and non-empirical characteristics that also need to be theorised in secu lar terms."
"Liveable for whom? Prospects of urban liveability to address health inequities Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians The aspiration of liveable cities, underpinned by the New Urban Agenda, is gaining popularity as a mechanism to enhance population health and wellbeing. However, less attention has been given to understanding how urban liveability may provide an opportunity to redress health inequities. Using an environmental justice lens, this paper investigates whether urban liveability poses an opportunity or threat to reducing health inequities and outlines a future research agenda. Selected urban liveability attributes, being: education; employment; food, alcohol, and tobacco; green space; housing; transport; and walkability, were investigated to understand how they can serve to widen or narrow inequities. Some domains showed consistent evidence, others suggested context-specific associations that made it difficult to draw general conclusions, and some showed a reverse patterning with the social gradient, but with poorer outcomes. This suggests urban liveability attributes have equigenic potential, but operate within a complex system. We conclude more disadvantaged neighbourhoods and their residents likely have additional policy and design considerations for optimising outcomes, especially as changes to the contextual environment may impact neighbourhood composition through displacement and/or pulling up effects. Future research needs to continue to explore downstream associations using longitudinal and natural experiments, and also seek to gain a deeper understanding of the urban liveability system, including interactions, feedback loops, and non-linear and linear responses. There is a need to monitor neighbourhood population changes over time to understand how liveability impacts the most vulnerable. Other areas worthy of further investigation include applying a life course approach and understanding liveability within the context of other adversities and contextual settings."
"‘Care’ as camouflaging capitalism and obscuring harm: The user-generated pornography market and women's inequality Erotica; Porn; Sexual Behavior With the pornography industry's shift to platforms and a business model that heavily relies on user-generated content, there is a need to better understand how this industry sells itself to women as self-producing â€œcontent creatorsâ€, especially considering the sexualised violence involved in marketing content to consumers. As one way to unpack some of the strategic underpinnings and market dynamics of this newer production model, we introduce an institutional logics approach to analyse materials from five pornography platform websites. We find the dominant integration of a theme of â€œcareâ€ is being sold to women; which both works to camouflage this market and its capitalist norms, while also functioning to obfuscate this market's harm. Our study is significant in mapping some of the more disguised, blurred and paradoxical practices of this user-generated market while also revealing the newer ways women's harm and inequality is being (re)produced in the selling of self-production."
"Improving drought resilience in Northern Murray-Darling Basin farming communities: Is forecast-based financing suitable? Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China A trend towards drier conditions during the April to October â€˜coolâ€™ season across southern Australia has been observed in the past few decades. Frequent and prolonged droughts have a significant impact on the financial stability of affected farming communities. Forecast-based Financing (FbF) is a novel proactive aid approach that provides support measures to increase resilience during the window between drought early warnings, and the actual onset and intensification of drought. Using the Northern Murray-Darling Basin as a case study, we investigated whether FbF combined with a user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought has the potential to increase the drought resilience of Australian farming communities. This study shows that farming businesses most impacted by drought have three common factors: (i) lower levels of business management skills, (ii) lower levels of pre-drought preparedness during non-drought periods, and (iii) slower responses when the intensity of drought increases. The results suggest that FbF in its current form is not recommended for a market economy such as Australia, as forms of direct assistance may have adverse long-term effects through disrupting the market itself and may not encourage farm operators to regularly assess and adapt their drought management strategies. Results also suggest that providing farmers, service providers, and all levels of government with tools that incorporate a user-centred I-EWS for drought can improve overall decision-making before, during, and even after drought. This change from a reactive to a proactive approach to managing drought impacts can be a highly effective form of increasing the drought resilience of farming communities."
"Policy recommendations for the zero energy building promotion towards carbon neutral in Asia-Pacific Region Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation The present global trend towards decarbonization under the Paris Agreement encourages regions and economies to explore possible ways to reduce energy intensity and minimize emissions into the environment. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), which accounts for 60% of world energy demand, aims to reduce energy intensity by 45% from 2005 levels by 2035 and double the share of renewable energy in the energy mix between 2010 and 2030. The promotion of Zero Energy Building (ZEB) was considered the most efficient way to respond to these goals in the building sector. A comprehensive review of progress over the past decade and a comparison of the definitions, standards and goals of ZEB in the five biggest economies of APEC (Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States) was carried out. In 2020, these five economies announced a carbon neutral goal towards 2050/2060, which will significantly affect the building sector in the foreseeable future. According to the progress review of ZEB over the last decade, this paper analyzes gaps in the building sector towards zero emissions by 2050 and proposes 10 policy recommendations covering multi-aspect and multi-factor in the APEC. The research will help steer more efficient and effective ZEB policies towards zero energy/emissions in the building sector in the Asia-Pacific region."
"Assessment of soil metal concentrations in residential and community vegetable gardens in Melbourne, Australia Lead Level in Blood; Lead Poisoning; Lead Blood Level Gardening and urban food production is an increasingly popular activity, which can improve physical and mental health and provide low cost nutritious food. However, the legacy of contamination from industrial and diffuse sources may have rendered surface soils in some urban gardens to have metals value in excess of recommended guidelines for agricultural production. The objective of this study was to establish the presence and spatial extent of soil metal contamination in Melbourne's residential and inner city community gardens. A secondary objective was to assess whether soil lead (Pb) concentrations in residential vegetable gardens were associated with the age of the home or the presence or absence of paint. The results indicate that most samples in residential and community gardens were generally below the Australian residential guidelines for all tested metals except Pb. Mean soil Pb concentrations exceeded the Australian HIL-A residential guideline of 300 mg/kg in 8% of 13 community garden beds and 21% of the 136 residential vegetable gardens assessed. Mean and median soil Pb concentrations for residential vegetable gardens was 204 mg/kg and 104 mg/kg (range <4â€“3341 mg/kg), respectively. Mean and median soil Pb concentration for community vegetable garden beds was 102 mg/kg and 38 mg/kg (range = 17â€“578 mg/kg), respectively. Soil Pb concentrations were higher in homes with painted exteriors (p = 0.004); generally increased with age of the home (p = 0.000); and were higher beneath the household dripline than in vegetable garden beds (p = 0.040). In certain circumstances, the data indicates that elevated soil Pb concentrations could present a potential health hazard in a portion of inner-city residential vegetable gardens in Melbourne."
"Emergenc(i)es of the crisis: Anti-heroic figures of youth entrepreneurship in Spain Labour Market; Atypical Employment; Active Labour Market Policy The aim of this article is to understand the key elements of the entrepreneurship as a governmental program reactivated during the last economic crisis and to tackle the effects that it is generating on Spanish youths. European and Spanish entrepreneurship policies have emerged as an emergency solution to the high unemployment and job insecurity experienced by young people. Our hypothesis is that they are having controversial and paradoxical effects on the subjectification processes of young people. From this departure point, the concept of â€œgrammar of entrepreneurshipâ€ is proposed to account for how agents from different fields â€”political, educational, financial, media â€” summon a morality, a mood disposition and a type of entrepreneurial subjectivity that, given the present socio-economic situation, is paradoxical, if not unachievable. Based on a qualitative fieldwork centred on the experiences and narratives of young people involved in entrepreneurship, some analytical figures that point out to those limits and impossibilities are reviewed and contrasted. Among them, those which condense the discomforts and contradictions produced by the grammar of the entrepreneurship such as emperdedor, emprendeudor o emprecario (combination of words linking entrepreneurship with loss, debt and precariousness respectively)."
"Global Review and Analysis of the Presence of Microplastics in Fish Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter This review provides an account of fish species contaminated with microplastics (MPs) across the globe (seven continents). A total of 887 fish species were found contaminated with MPs based on MPs in the gastrointestinal tract/GI. The most MPs contaminated-fish species found were marine and demersal species. Globally 45 % of fish ingested MPs with an average concentration of 5.93 MPs particles per fish species. Among all the countries, China had the highest number of fish species contaminated with MPs in the following orders: China (176 species), Brazil (84), the USA (48), India (35), the Atlantic Ocean (31), Iran (30), Bangladesh (28), Turkey (26), Indonesia (25), the UK (23), Saudi Arabia (23), Thailand (21), Portugal (20), Australia (20), Italy (18), South Africa (18), Argentina (15), Chile (14), Galapagos Islands (Ecuador) (14), the North Pacific Gyre (14), Samoa (13), Malaysia (12), Colombia (11), New Zealand (11), Fiji (10), Spain (10), the North Sea (09), South Korea (09), Tahiti (09), Vanuatu (09), Ghana (08), Canada (07), Japan (07) and Nigeria (07) and others. MPs ingestion in fishes varied (high, medium, and low) among the locations/countries. In several locations/countries, MPs ingestion/contamination occurred in up to 100 % of fish samples. Because of MPs contamination, seafood fisheries, and the livelihoods of people associated with fishing, aquaculture, and seafood business, can be threatened. It may also increase health risks to seafood fish consumers since there is a probability that high risks pollutants adsorbed in MPs can be transferred to humans via the food chain."
"Female warriors: a reproduction of patriarchal narrative of Hua Mulan in The Red Detachment of Women (1972) China; Mao Zedong; Socialist During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the CCP officially claimed that Chinese women achieved an equal position as men, and the Confucian patriarchal family was deconstructed. This article is an ongoing exploration of Maoist gender discourse by analysing the image of female warriors in the revolutionary opera film, The Red Detachment of Women (1972) which was made and popularised during the Cultural Revolution. This article finds that Maoist gender discourse failed to deconstruct the Confucian patriarchy. The image of female warriors in the revolutionary opera films was a reproduction of the patriarchal narrative of Hua Mulan, which served an ethical symbol of loyalty and filial daughter in the discourse of Confucian patriarchy. Similar to Mulan, the masculinised image of female warriors in the revolutionary opera films cannot be identified as a feminist representation yet a cultural and ethical symbol of filial daughter that leads to womenâ€™s subordination to menâ€™s needs."
"Resource speed limits: Maximal rate of resource variation Adiabaticity; Qubits; Quantum Control Recent advances in quantum resource theories have been driven by the fact that many quantum information protocols make use of different facets of the same physical features, e.g. entanglement, coherence, etc. Resource theories formalise the role of these important physical features in a given protocol. One question that remains open until now is: how quickly can a resource be generated or degraded? Using the toolkit of quantum speed limits we construct bounds on the minimum time required for a given resource to change by a fixed increment, which might be thought of as the power of said resource, i.e., the rate of resource variation. We show that the derived bounds are tight by considering several examples. Finally, we discuss some applications of our results, which include generalisations of thermodynamic work, heat, and power to any given resource, as well as fundamental bounds on the computation rate in leading quantum processing architectures."
"Board gender diversity and corporate carbon commitment: Does industry matter? Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence The study examines whether board gender diversity is associated with corporate carbon commitment, and if so, whether the association varies between firms operating in the extractive and non-extractive industries. Based on insights drawn from gender socialization, resource dependence, and critical mass theories, we develop models that link board gender diversity with corporate carbon commitment. Analyzing data obtained from Standard and Poor's 1500 firms, for the period 2015 to 2019, we find that higher representation of women on a firm's board is positively associated with the firm's carbon commitment and that the association is stronger for firms in the extractive industries. Furthermore, a nominal appointment of women to a firm's board reduces the likelihood of the firm's carbon commitment being at a given or higher level, while the appointment of a â€œcritical massâ€ of women to the board increases the firm's inclination toward higher carbon commitment. Our findings suggest that regulatory and policymaking agencies could exploit legislative and policy initiatives that would promote board gender diversity to encourage corporates, especially those operating in the extractive industries, to commit to the climate change cause."
"Omics-based ecosurveillance uncovers the influence of estuarine macrophytes on sediment microbial function and metabolic redundancy in a tropical ecosystem Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus Vertical zonation within estuarine ecosystems can strongly influence microbial diversity and function by regulating competition, predation, and environmental stability. The degree to which microbial communities exhibit horizontal patterns through an estuary has received comparatively less attention. Here, we take a multi-omics ecosurveillance approach to study environmental gradients created by the transition between dominant vegetation types along a near pristine tropical river system (Wenlock River, Far North Queensland, Australia). The study sites included intertidal mudflats fringed by saltmarsh, mangrove or mixed soft substrata habitats. Collected sediments were analyzed for eukaryotes and prokaryotes using small sub-unit (SSU) rRNA gene amplicons to profile the relative taxonomic composition. Central carbon metabolism metabolites and other associated organic polar metabolites were analyzed using established metabolomics-based approaches, coupled with total heavy metals analysis. Eukaryotic taxonomic information was found to be more informative of habitat type. Bacterial taxonomy and community composition also showed habitat-specificity, with phyla Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria strongly linked to mangroves and saltmarshes, respectively. In contrast, metabolite profiling was critical for understanding the biochemical pathways and expressed functional outputs in these systems that were tied to predicted microbial gene function (16S rRNA). A high degree of metabolic redundancy was observed in the bacterial communities, with the metabolomics data suggesting varying degrees of metabolic criticality based on habitat type. The predicted functions of the bacterial taxa combined with annotated metabolites accounted for the conservative perspective of microbial community redundancy against the putative metabolic pathway impacts in the metabolomics data. Coupling these data demonstrates that habitat-mediated estuarine gradients drive patterns of community diversity and metabolic function and highlights the real redundancy potential of habitat microbiomes. This information is useful as a point of comparison for these sensitive ecosystems and provides a framework for identifying potentially vulnerable or at-risk systems before they are significantly degraded."
"Role of regression analysis and variation of rheological data in calculation of pressure drop for sludge pipelines Sewage; Total Solids; Activated Sludge Sludge pumps in wastewater treatment plants are often oversized due to uncertainty in calculation of pressure drop. This issue costs millions of dollars for industry to purchase and operate the oversized pumps. Besides costs, higher electricity consumption is associated with extra CO2 emission which creates huge environmental impacts. Calculation of pressure drop via current pipe flow theory requires model estimation of flow curve data which depends on regression analysis and also varies with natural variation of rheological data. This study investigates impact of variation of rheological data and regression analysis on variation of pressure drop calculated via current pipe flow theories. Results compare the variation of calculated pressure drop between different models and regression methods and suggest on the suitability of each method."
"Recent advances in heterogeneous catalyst design for biorefining Biomass; Levulinic Acids; Ethyl Levulinate Biorefineries are a new concept in chemical manufacturing in which naturally occurring, sustainable biomass resources such as forestry and agricultural waste are converted to diverse fuel and chemical product streams, akin to the processing of non-renewable fossil fuels by petrochemical refineries. Biomass derived from waste agricultural and forestry materials or non-food crops offers the most easily implemented and economical solutions for transportation fuels, and the only nonpetroleum route to organic molecules for the manufacture of bulk, fine, and speciality chemicals necessary to secure the future needs of society. The successful implementation of biorefineries can address concerns over dwindling oil reserves, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel sources and associated climate change, and will be underpinned by catalytic processes to facilitate the co-production of platform chemicals and biofuels. Catalysis is a central theme in sustainable chemistry, lowering energy and resource requirements while minimising waste production. In contrast to fossil-derived crude oil, which has low oxygen content, the high oxygen and water content of biomass feedstocks presents challenges for their utilisation and requires innovations in catalyst and process design for the selective conversion of these hydrophilic, bulky feedstocks into fuels or high-value chemicals. This article highlights how methods to control porosity, solid acid and base character, and surface hydrophobicity are essential components of a toolkit for the design of heterogeneous catalysts for biomass processing."
"A conceptual analysis of social housing as infrastructure Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Safe, adequate, affordable and appropriate housing is critical to health, wellbeing, and social and economic security. However, many Australians cannot find housing in the private market, and the social housing system is under-resourced and manifestly unable to meet demand. In response to this, there is emerging interest in whether reconceptualising social housing as a form of essential infrastructure might help to attract additional investment, especially from private sector sources. The case for social housing as infrastructure rests on the following findings. Social housing can more strongly position itself as a form of infrastructure by making better use of infrastructure policy conventions, including cost-benefit analysis and business cases. Government intervention in response to significant housing needs, challenges and failures in the Australian housing market is both reasonable and warranted, but the true extent of the problem needs to be accurately recognised as extending beyond the margins of the market. Government budget prioritiesâ€”in particular the lack of priority given to social housingâ€”are the principal reasons for the lack of investment in the Australian social housing system. There is a strong historical precedent for the Australian social housing system as a contributor to economic growth and productivity, and as providing the basis for a decent and equitable society. Although the case can be made that social housing is infrastructure, this is not sufficient for making the case for social housing. Policy makers need to make better use of cost-benefit analysis techniques and other methods for making the business case for social housing, while ensuring that those aspects of social housing that are not easily quantified or monetised are not overlooked or excluded. Policy makers, together with academics, providers, advocates and tenant groups, need to advance stronger arguments in favour of direct government involvement in the provision and financing of social and affordable housing that focus on the achievement of a broader set of social and economic purposes."
"Purchase, protect, resell, repeat: an effective process for conserving biodiversity on private land? Easement; Private Lands; Landowners Global conservation efforts are increasingly focused on expanding the amount of permanently protected private land, with the aim of preserving biodiversity. These efforts are often constrained by financial resources, particularly where land acquisition is expensive, or where landowners are reluctant to enter into conservation agreements. Purchaseâ€“protectâ€“resale (PPR) programs are used by conservation organizations in a number of countries to facilitate the purchase, resale, and protection of private land. We conducted the first systematic review of the literature on PPR and collated information on its use around the world. In total, we found that funds exceeding US$384 million were available for PPR, and over 684,000 ha have been protected to date. We identify the unique attributes of this approach and the challenges of its implementation, and discuss its potential for protecting land unsuitable for other conservation approaches. Our analysis highlights the importance of selecting appropriate properties, and we suggest that insights from the economics literature could help to improve the effectiveness of PPR programs."
"Rice-shrimp ecosystems in the Mekong Delta: Linking water quality, shrimp and their natural food sources Biofloc Technology; Penaeus Vannamei; Aquaculture Aquatic ecosystems are used for extensive rice-shrimp culture where the available water alternates seasonally between fresh and saline. Poor water quality has been implicated as a risk factor for shrimp survival; however, links between shrimp, water quality and their main food source, the natural aquatic biota inhabiting these ponds, are less well understood. We examined the aquatic biota and water quality of three ponds over an entire year in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, where the growing season for the marine shrimp Penaeus monodon has been extended into the wet season, when waters freshen. The survival (30â€“41%) and total areal biomass (350â€“531 kg haâˆ’1) of shrimp was constrained by poor water quality, with water temperatures, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentrations falling outside known optimal ranges for several weeks. Declines in dissolved oxygen concentration were matched by declines in both shrimp growth rates and lipid content, the latter being indicative of nutritional condition. Furthermore, as the dry season transitioned into the wet, shifts in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton were accompanied by declines in the biomass of benthic algae, an important basal food source in these systems. Densities of the benthic invertebrates directly consumed by shrimp also varied substantially throughout the year. Overall, our findings suggest that the survival, condition and growth of shrimp in extensive rice-shrimp ecosystems will be constrained when poor water quality and alternating high and low salinity negatively affect the physiology, growth and composition of the natural aquatic biota. Changes in management practices, such as restricting shrimp inhabiting ponds to the dry season, may help to address these issues and improve the sustainable productivity and overall condition of these important aquatic ecosystems."
"Introducing C phase in additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V: A new oxygen-stabilized face-centred cubic solid solution with improved mechanical properties Cubic; Face-Centered Cubic Crystal System; Titanium An oxygen-rich face-centred cubic (FCC) Ti phase was engineered in the microstructure of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy via additive manufacturing using laser powder bed fusion. Designated 'C', this oxygen-rich FCC phase has a lattice parameter of 0.406 nm and exhibits an orientation relationship with the parent Î±â€² phase as follows: (0 0 0 1)Î±â€²//{1 1 1}C, and ã€ˆ12Â¯10ã€‰Î±â€² //ã€ˆ11Â¯0ã€‰C. We propose that the formation of the C phase is facilitated by the combined effect of thermal gradients, deformation induced by the martensitic transformation, and local O enrichment. This enables an in-situ phase transformation from the hexagonal close-packed Î±â€² phase to the C phase at elevated temperatures. Our density functional theory calculations indicate that oxygen occupancy in the octahedral interstices of the FCC structure is energetically preferred to corresponding sites in the Î±â€² phase. The in-situ mechanical testing results indicate that the presence of the FCC phase significantly increases the local yield strength from 1.2 GPa for samples with only the Î±â€² phase to 1.9 GPa for samples comprising approximately equal volume fractions of the Î±â€² and FCC phases. No loss of ductility was reported, demonstrating great potential for strengthening and work hardening. We discuss the formation mechanism of the FCC phase and a pathway for future microstructural design of titanium alloys by additive manufacturing."
"Teacher professional development for disability inclusion in low- and middle-income Asia-Pacific countries: An evidence and gap map Inclusive Education; Special Educational Needs; Psychological Practice Background: In the Asia-Pacific region, around one-third of the children who are out-of-school have a disability and given that teacher readiness and capability are key contributors for inclusive education, it is high time for a mapping of disability inclusive teacher professional development (TPD) interventions in this region. Objectives: The key objective of this evidence and gap map (EGM) is to locate evidence on interventions for in-service TPD focussing on education for the inclusion of students with a disability in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the Asia-Pacific region. Search Methods: A broad range of bibliographic databases and repositories were searched electronically to identify the evidence published between January 2000 and December 2021. Key search platforms included the British Education Index (BEI), Education Research Complete (ERC), Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), SCOPUS, 3ie Development Evidence Portal (Evidence Hub) and the Campbell Collaborations Systematic Reviews and EGMs portal (Better evidence for a better world). In addition, potential program evaluations/impact reports, reviews, case studies, and program descriptions/summaries were sought through â€˜snowballingâ€™ based on searching bibliographies and reference lists of papers located during the search process, as well as specific searches of relevant grey literature. Selection Criteria: To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to contain sufficient details about TPD interventions that support early childhood educators and kindergarten to Year 12 teachers to understand the needs of students with disabilities and aid them to create inclusive mainstream classrooms and/or provide improved support for students with disabilities in special education settings. Data Collection and Analysis: A total of 820 records were entered into the MS Excel file in which the entire data extraction process was managed. All records were screened against the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and any differences were resolved through consultations. All included studies and their characteristics were extracted from the MS Excel file and uploaded to the ACER server in.csv file format. The interactive, online EGM is available here: https://datavis.acer.org/gem/disability-inclusion-TPD/. Main Results: Fifty studies from 16 countries out of the 41 LMICs in the Asia-Pacific region were identified, whereby Thailand had the largest number of studies with evidence (7) followed by China, Vietnam, and India (5 each). Two main gaps in research about professional learning were identified. First, only three studies reported interventions aimed at supporting mental health among students with a disability. Second, no studies were found that reported on how teachers could support positive student behaviour. These gaps are important because research has persistently suggested that experiencing disability is an important risk factor for young people developing mental health conditions. Authors' Conclusions: This report illustrates the critical value of evaluating and publishing evidence from disability inclusive TPD interventions in LMICs, including any that are ongoing, or are components of highly resource intensive large-scale education sector programs."
"RSV Prevention in All Infants: Which Is the Most Preferable Strategy? Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus; Vaccine; Pneumovirus Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes a spectrum of respiratory illnesses in infants and young children that may lead to hospitalizations and a substantial number of outpatient visits, which result in a huge economic and healthcare burden. Most hospitalizations happen in otherwise healthy infants, highlighting the need to protect all infants against RSV. Moreover, there is evidence on the association between early-life RSV respiratory illness and recurrent wheezing/asthma-like symptoms As such, RSV is considered a global health priority. However, despite this, the only prevention strategy currently available is palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) indicated in a subset of preterm infants or those with comorbidities, hence leaving the majority of the infant population unprotected against this virus. Therefore, development of prevention strategies against RSV for all infants entering their first RSV season constitutes a large unmet medical need. The aim of this review is to explore different immunization approaches to protect all infants against RSV. Prevention strategies include maternal immunization, immunization of infants with vaccines, immunization of infants with licensed mAbs (palivizumab), and immunization of infants with long-acting mAbs (e.g., nirsevimab, MK-1654). Of these, palivizumab use is restricted to a small population of infants and does not offer a solution for all-infant protection, whereas vaccine development in infants has encountered various challenges, including the immaturity of the infant immune system, highlighting that future pediatric vaccines will most likely be used in older infants (>6 months of age) and children. Consequently, maternal immunization and immunization of infants with long-acting mAbs represent the two feasible strategies for protection of all infants against RSV. Here, we present considerations regarding these two strategies covering key areas which include mechanism of action, â€œconsistencyâ€ of protection, RSV variability, duration of protection, flexibility and optimal timing of immunization, benefit for the mother, programmatic implementation, and acceptance of each strategy by key stakeholders. We conclude that, based on current data, immunization of infants with long-acting mAbs might represent the most effective approach for protecting all infants entering their first RSV season."
"Recent sustainable trends in Vietnam's fashion supply chain Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices The integration of sustainable practices within the fashion supply chain has been one of the areas receiving increased attention due to global competition and stricter regulations. The concept of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) ensures that eco-friendly practices have been adopted by many global fashion brands. Fashion industries in developing countries such as Vietnam, one of the leading fashion manufacturing countries in South-East Asia, are under tremendous pressure to comply with sustainability norms. Therefore, this paper aims to review the recent trends in SSCM in Vietnam's fashion and retail industries. A four-step approach was adopted: collection of information through literature or data collection (Step 1), classification and codification (step 2), input of industry experts (Step 3) and analysis of the above three inputs (Step 4). The findings showed that although Vietnam is among the top five exporting countries of textiles and garments globally, the concept of a sustainable supply chain is new to many of the Vietnamese supply chain players. Four out of five stakeholders claimed that they are attempting to achieve sustainability by reducing environmental pollution, taking care of the labor force, and pursuing future sustainable materials as well as renewable energy resources. In addition, one of the stakeholders, the retailers, regularly focus on ethical practices in their sustainable sourcing. These practices help Vietnam to concurrently diminish its environmental impact and ensuing negative consequences as well as improve the country's social and economic sustainability."
"A method for validating the structural completeness of understory vegetation models captured with 3D remote sensing Lidar; Tree and Stand Measurements; Forest Inventory Characteristics describing below canopy vegetation are important for a range of forest ecosystem applications including wildlife habitat, fuel hazard and fire behaviour modelling, understanding forest recovery after disturbance and competition dynamics. Such applications all rely on accurate measures of vegetation structure. Inherent in this is the assumption or ability to demonstrate measurement accuracy. 3D point clouds are being increasingly used to describe vegetated environments, however limited research has been conducted to validate the information content of terrestrial point clouds of understory vegetation. This paper describes the design and use of a field frame to co-register point intercept measurements with point cloud data to act as a validation source. Validation results show high correlation of point matching in forests with understory vegetation elements with large mass and/or surface area, typically consisting of broad leaves, twigs and bark 0.02 m diameter or greater in size (SfM, MCC 0.51-0.66; TLS, MCC 0.37-0.47). In contrast, complex environments with understory vegetation elements with low mass and low surface area showed lower correlations between validation measurements and point clouds (SfM, MCC 0.40 and 0.42; TLS, MCC 0.25 and 0.16). The results of this study demonstrate that the validation frame provides a suitable method for comparing the relative performance of different point cloud generation processes."
"Site-specific delivery of a natural chemotherapeutic agent to human lung cancer cells using biotinylated 2D rGO nanocarriers Graphene Oxide; Graphite; Tissue Engineering Chemotherapy has remained one of the most commonly employed treatment modalities for cancer. Despite the clinical availability of a large number of chemotherapeutic agents, the uncontrolled systemic distribution and the associated harmful side effects of chemotherapeutic agents pose major challenges demanding concerted efforts to enhance their cancer targetability. The layered structure of two-dimensional (2D) materials offers new opportunities by increasing the drug pay-load influencing the drug-release kinetics in a cancer micro-environment and facilitating targetability through the large accessible surface area. To investigate such potential benefits of 2D materials, we have developed a biocompatible targeted 2D drug delivery system using graphene oxide (GO) as a model nanocarrier (NC) that could hold a high concentration of gallic acid (GA), a natural chemotherapeutic agent found in green tea. Interestingly, the antioxidant nature of GA also reduced GO to a high-quality few-layered thin reduced-graphene oxide (rGO) during drug loading while forming rGO nanocarrier (rGONC). The biotinylated rGONC further improved their targetability to A549 human lung carcinoma cells and they enhanced cellular internalization efficiency. From these targeted 2D NCs, the drug could release only slowly at the physiological pH but liberated rapidly at lower pH encountered by the tumor microenvironment resulting in significant toxicity toward the lung carcinoma cells. As such, this work opens up new possibilities for employing 2D materials for targeted chemotherapeutic applications."
"Fuel poverty and subjective wellbeing Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort We use 13 waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey to examine the effect of fuel poverty on subjective wellbeing (SWB) in Australia. We find that being in fuel poverty lowers SWB. When we instrument for fuel poverty using electricity and gas prices, we find that a standard deviation increase in fuel poverty is associated with declines of 0.168â€“0.458 standard deviations in SWB, depending on how fuel poverty is measured. The general conclusion that fuel poverty lowers SWB is robust to alternative ways of measuring fuel poverty, a suite of estimation approaches and other sensitivity checks."
"Crossovers double-crossed: NGOs, semi-clientelism and political reform Hamas; Israel; Palestine One significant facet of politics in the Philippines has been the crossover of personnel from development non-government organisations (NGOs) into executive appointments. The hope has been that these alliances would lead to better outcomes in social reform and poverty reduction. The experiences of these reform attempts are discussed and analysed according to contrasting theoretical approaches to civil society and the state. It concludes that a Gramscian approach provides a better explanation of the semi-clientelist process of alliance formation in the Philippines. Historic blocs have utilised development NGOs within hegemonic processes to legitimise the operation of exploitative social class relationships."
"Male and female mental health differences in built environment undergraduates Emotional Intelligence; Job Performance; Emotion The construction industry faces skills shortages and growing mental health issues which have stimulated a research focus on the underrepresentation of female employees and on its tough macho-culture and stressful working conditions. Evidence of sex differences in construction workersâ€™ mental health is starting to emerge, with women and younger workers experiencing the greatest levels of distress. This study takes an upstream perspective on construction human resources to explore sex differences in mental health and resilience in the early career pipeline of emerging built environment (BE) professionals. A survey of 384 BE undergraduates was conducted using the DASS-21 measure of mental health and the Resilience at University scale to explore the psychological adjustment of first and final year student cohorts. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, and regression. Compared to first year students, female studentsâ€™ mental health appeared to have deteriorated across the four-year degree, whereas, male studentsâ€™ overall mental health improved. The results suggest that the construction classroom may be operating as a microcosm of the cultural environment faced by women in society in general and in the construction industry with its macho culture filtering back into the university sector. These findings suggest the need for greater attention to sex and gender differences in mental health. It is recommended that construction educators and employers partner together to proactively affect culture change by addressing gender bias early, by consciously creating a female-friendly, inclusive culture which emphasises a sense of belonging, and by providing gender-appropriate support systems and resilience training for emerging construction professionals."
"π-Conjugated Amine-ZnO Nanohybrids for the Selective Detection of CO2 Gas at Room Temperature Carbon Dioxide; Work Functions; Gas The development of a new type of hybrid material comprising naphthalene-based Ï€-conjugated amine (NBA) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanohybrid, grown in situ on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) flexible substrate, is explored. The morphology of the nanohybrids is controlled by optimizing growth time of the hydrothermal reaction. The CO2 sensor utilizing NBA-ZnO nanohybrids shows outstanding sensing performance with a maximum response of âˆ¼9% to 500 ppm of CO2 at room temperature and a comparatively fast response/recovery time (âˆ¼3/6 min). The sensor has excellent mechanical flexibility with consistent sensing performance under bending/relaxing process. Hydrophobic nature of the NBA provides less humidity effect on the sensing performance of the NBA-ZnO nanohybrids, which make it suitable for room-temperature application. Also, the presence of layer-by-layer assembly in the NBA-ZnO nanohybrids provides a superior path for carrier transport, which reduces the response and recovery time. All these results indicate that NBA-ZnO nanohybrid is a promising material for room temperature CO2 sensing application. Â©"
"Circularity in the Built Environment: A Focus on India Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals The built environment operates in a linear way where large amounts of non-renewable resources are used to feed the growing and rapid city building activities taking place globally, particularly in the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. Recent estimates from the World Bank (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2017, p. 4) indicate that over half of the worldâ€™s population will live in urban areas, whilst providing over 80% of global GDP generation. Building and construction uses 36% of energy consumption, produces 40% waste and estimated approximately 40% carbon dioxide emissions (GABC 2017). â€˜Achieving Growthâ€™ (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2017, p. 12) has identified 115 billion euros investment opportunities in the built environment for designing and constructing buildings based on circular principles, closing the loop on building construction and demolition materials, and building circular cities. Not just creating jobs, application of circular principles supports resilience, reduces resource use and lowers overall emissions. This paper focuses on India as an emerging economy. It discusses the potential of placing the country on a path of circularity with reference to the built environment. Two case studies are used to demonstrate examples of as-yet untapped upscaling potential of integrating principles of circularity. It offers opportunities to increase knowledge in the sector, develop mainstreaming platforms from fragmented examples, and most importantly decoupling economic growth with resource consumption. By sharing these learnings, the key value drivers of increasing life cycles of the asset from multiple functional perspectives, increasing utilization and expanding regenerative potentials in an increasingly digitized world are highlighted."
"Transferrin-conjugated quasi-cubic SPIONs for cellular receptor profiling and detection of brain cancer Myeloperoxidase; Colorimetric; Chromogenic Compounds The high biocompatibility, unique magnetic properties and significant biomedical potential of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have spurred a major interest in developing new strategies to synthesise aqueous-phase dispersible SPIONs. In parallel, the rapidly growing field of enzyme-mimicking catalytic nanomaterials, referred to as NanoZymes, has seen immense interest in utilising the unique properties of NanoZymes for new applications. Here, we report a new strategy for the large-scale synthesis of water dispersible quasi-cubic Î³-Fe2O3 SPIONs. This strategy provides a unique way to control the morphological characteristics of SPIONs through the in-situ formation of sodium oleate complex. Notably, our approach eliminates the need for high temperatures, complex cleaning protocols and post-synthesis phase-transfer strategies that are typically required during the well-established thermal decomposition synthesis approaches. We further establish the peroxidase-mimic NanoZyme activity of these quasi-cubic SPIONs and use them as an effective transducer platform to generate a unique colour through efficient oxidation of peroxidase substrates. By combining these inorganic enzymes with transferrin (Tf) as a brain cancer-specific targeting agent, we create a simple yet effective colorimetric biosensing platform that allows us to monitor the cellular expression profile of transferrin receptors (TfR). The difference in the expression profile of TfR in the U87MG glioblastoma cells and the fibroblast cells generates a distinct tonality of the colorimetric response. This not only allows cell surface receptor profiling but also allows robust identification of brain cancer cells. The high accuracy and precision of the proposed biosensor outlines the robustness of the NanoZyme-based catalysts in colorimetric detection of various targets."
"Feminism, masculinity politics and the human services Young; Sex Education; Sexuality Feminists in the human services have drawn attention to the prevalence of sexist attitudes and practices in social welfare and, female human service workers have developed interventions and policies aimed at overcoming sexism. The contemporary male radical social work literature neglects analyses of masculinity and practice with men. There are a variety of ways of classifying the menâ€™s movement. The chapter identifies four distinct approaches: menâ€™s rights, mythopoetics, menâ€™s liberation and pro-feminism. These four trends have been the source of considerable conflict in menâ€™s politics from its beginning. A key argument of the menâ€™s rights movement is that men are unfairly blamed by women and feminism. The emphasis of much of the menâ€™s rightsâ€™ response to feminism is that women are equally responsible for the problems in the world and the issues confronting them. Profeminism for men involves a sense of responsibility to our own and other menâ€™s sexism, and a commitment to work with women to end menâ€™s violence."
"Residential demand-side management using integrated solar-powered heat pump and thermal storage Demand Response; Demand Side Management; Energy Conservation Due to the mismatch between rooftop solar energy generation and residential electrical demand, considerable solar energy is exported into electricity networks causing a range of issues such as voltage instability and connection overload. To address these problems, we propose and analyse a residential hot water, heating and cooling system, which features a heat pump combined with thermal energy storage to align peak thermal loads with output from a rooftop solar system. This work quantifies the impacts of thermal storage on residential space-conditioning peak load reduction. Annual hourly thermal and domestic hot water loads were determined for a representative Australian house, located in Brisbane, using building energy simulation software and verified using measured data. Combined with the measured sub-metered electrical loads of other electrical appliances, this data was used to simulate the solar system export, heat pump demand, and thermal storage system performance. Results show that by combining a 5-kW solar system, the proposed system can reduce annual grid-electricity demand by approximately 76% compared with a conventional non-thermal storage system. Peak electrical load was also observed to undergo a temporal shift and reduce by approximately 45%. Furthermore, the solar fraction for air-conditioning and domestic hot water loads reached 84%, while solar self-consumption increased to about 56%. This study demonstrates that the proposed system is an effective means of managing electricity demand, shifting peak load and improving solar utilization, thus relieving stress on electricity networks from high penetration of solar photovoltaics."
"Service design for social change: reflections on teaching human-centred design in an undergraduate social work degree Participatory Design; Co-Design; Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Human Centred Design (HCD) is emerging in Australia as a participatory approach to service design in social work and human services organisations. In this article, we reflect upon our incorporation of HCD into a core unit offered to final-year students in a Bachelor of Social Work (Honours) degree, as part of a collaboration between design and social work academics. We highlight successes and challenges, and identify adaptations that can provide HCD with a stronger strength-based, critical approach that better aligns with critical social work education. We provide suggestions for social work practitioners and educators around implementing HCD, in ways that inspire critical and reflexive thinking, promote social justice and focus on designing for progressive, structural and social change."
"Performance of high volume fly ash concrete incorporating additives: A systematic literature review Coal Ash; Silica Fume; Concretes Fly ash is commonly used as a partial cement replacement material, but this is limited to replacement levels of 30% or less, with significant quantities of fly ash still not utilized globally. There has been significant recent research into High Volume Fly Ash (HVFA) concrete to enable the utilization of fly ash and to reduce CO2 emission by reducing cement demand. This comprehensive review summarizes up to date literature on HVFA concrete with more than 50% of cement replacement using ASTM Class F low calcium fly ash. Firstly, the available HVFA literature in which only fly has been used to replace cement, is categorized based on the replacement level and the mechanical and durability property results are summarized. Secondly, the remaining literature is categorized based on the different material additions to modify the HVFA concrete and the results are compared. The summarized results are discussed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the reported results. The effect of each material addition on the HVFA concrete properties are also discussed to identify potentially more suitable additives for future development. Overall, this paper will provide an understanding of the current state of HVFA concrete research and the gaps in research for the development HVFA concrete containing higher replacement levels and achieving the required performance. Hence, summarised knowledge would significantly be beneficial to design prospective research towards a sustainable cement-free concrete using industrial waste."
"Negotiating Indonesian Married Women’s Agency in a Career: Work From Home Arrangement as a Possible Solution Personnel; Teleworker; Flexible Working Financial challenges have led to the emergence of dual-earner couples. Nonetheless, in male-dominated societies like Indonesia, womenâ€™s career involvement, although contributing to the household income, is not correlated with menâ€™s contribution to the household task. A career is seen as a privilege for women because their primary value is conventionally anchored on marriage and family. International studies suggested that the Work From Home (WFH) arrangement is an effective solution to enable women to balance their work and family roles. While WFH was nonexistent in Indonesia before the COVID-19 pandemic, the latter forced companies to adopt the former. This provided an opportunity to examine whether WFH can be a remedy for working Indonesian women to negotiate their work and family roles. Hence this study is aimed to look closely at the issue, comprising two general aims. First, it provides a general picture of current practices of division of gender in Indonesia using current literature. Second, using online survey data from 201 Indonesian workers, this report provides empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of WFH, particularly for married working women in Indonesia in negotiating their work and household roles. While describing current feminism issues in the non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) societies, the article also discusses the long-term practical strategy to empower Indonesian women in careers by emphasizing gender equality while acknowledging the menâ€™s leadership role."
"Building the Evidence for Family Violence Policy Reform: The Work of Specialist Women's Refuges in Victoria, Australia Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Help-Seeking While specialist women's refuges have been central to responses to family violence since the 1970s, their work is under-researched. Little is known outside the family violence sector about the support they provide and how it assists women and children. There have been some critiques of their work but there is limited knowledge of the constraints women's refuges face. Based on interviews and focus groups with 100 professional stakeholders and twenty-two service users, this article analyses the work of women's refuges in the Australian state of Victoria in an effort to inform policy reform. The research found that refuges' underpinning gendered analysis, focus on safety and support and advocacy to ensure women's human rights are met have much to offer further developments in responding to family violence. In doing so, the article contributes to critical debates about the operation of refuges and the need for specialist family violence services."
"Sub-cell radiation-conduction (SCRC) model in densely packed beds of mono-sized pebbles for HTGR under vacuum condition Computational Fluid Dynamics; Pebble Bed Reactors; Effective Conductivity The equivalent sub-cells of radiation and conduction are modeled for close packing structures of mono-sized pebbles. The aim is to calculate and analyze the average radiative and conductive heat transfer of high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) under different ranges of temperature to further assist in the design and operation of HTGRs. The sub-cell radiation-conduction (SCRC) model is established analytically according to the analysis of thermal resistance networks for radiation and conduction. It can be utilized to calculate the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) due to radiation and conduction in an HTGR under vacuum conditions. Comparisons of data of ETC obtained from the SCRC model, empirical models, and experiments are carried out under vacuum conditions. Comparisons of the non-dimensional radiation exchange factor (REF) between the SCRC model and other occasionally used models are also given. The comparisons show that the SCRC model is generally in accord with the commonly used models and the experimental results. The results demonstrated that the established SCRC model is expected to be able to describe the radiation and conduction in closely packed pebble beds under wide temperature ranges and vacuum conditions reasonably."
"Machine learning approach for the prediction of biomass pyrolysis kinetics from preliminary analysis Pyrolysis; Briquettes; Pelleting The pyrolytic behavior of lignocellulosic biomass is highly complex, and its kinetic behavior varies with operating conditions and the type of biomass. To reduce timescales, cost and rigorous calculations associated with new set of experimentation used for the estimation of kinetic parameters, model-based predictions are recommended. In the present work, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based machine learning models are developed to predict the biomass pyrolysis kinetics. Data sets of thermogravimetric analysis and feedstock characterization from a diverse range of biomass were used to develop and test the networks. Four models were developed in this study based on proximate analysis (ANN-1), ultimate analysis (ANN-2), combined proximate and ultimate analysis (ANN-3) and the combined proximate, ultimate, and biochemical analysis (ANN-4). A total of 704 kinetic datasets were extracted and recalculated with the Coats-Redfern Method from which 662, 585, 465 and 133 datasets were used to develop models sequentially. The developed models, in particular ANN-3 and ANN-4 have shown a competitive prediction capability (R2 ~ 0.99, RRMSE <10.0%, and MAE < 0.071). Relative importance of each input (biomass properties & heating rate) on outputs (kinetic parameters) was also studied. Biochemical analysis was found to have higher contribution (~38%) in comparison to ultimate (~29%) followed by proximate analysis (~22%) and the pyrolysis kinetics were found to be affected by the heating rate to the extent of ~10%. The developed models were found to be accurate enough in predicting the pyrolysis kinetics for any new biomass feedstocks based on preliminary analysis."

"Understanding the properties of fat, oil, and grease and their removal using grease interceptors Lubricating Greases; Oils and Fats; Waste Water Treatment of wastewater with high levels of fat, oil, and grease (FOG), produced by the growing number (annually 2%) of food service establishments (FSEs), is a major concern for water utilities. About 30â€“40% of sewer blockages are caused primarily by the formation of FOG deposits in sewer pipes, and an annual additional maintenance cost is required for sewer management. To manage FOG deposition, FSEs are required to recover the FOG at the point of generation by installing grease interceptors (GIs) before release to the sewer system. The successful control of FOG deposition is largely dependent on clear understanding of its complex properties, pre-treatment processes, deposition mechanism and public awareness. The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the physicochemical properties of FOG, including particle size distribution and their removal efficiencies by existing GIs. Nowadays, generation of FOG particles of â‰¤45 Âµm is increasing because of the increasing use of automatic dishwashers. Current hybrid processes which comprise pre-treatment prior to GI use are ineffective since they are unable to completely remove particle sizes of â‰¤45 Âµm. Hence, there is potential for these particles to be released into the sewer system and eventually cause blockages. This critical review discusses the characteristics of effluents, including the particle size distributions generated from automatic dishwashers and handwash sinks. It concludes by providing some case studies and a perspective of the future opportunities to develop a novel GI process integrated with pre-treatment to remove particles of all sizes, including colloidal particles."
"Pandemic and teacher retention: empirical evidence from expat teachers in Southeast Asia during COVID-19 Teacher Evaluation; Teacher Labor Markets; Teacher Training Purpose: This research aims to explore the influence of expat teachers' attitude about local policies, and their subjective norms of social engagement during COVID-19 over their intention to leave the current country, due to COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses analysis of variance (ANOVA) and structural equation model (SEM) to examine the perception of crisis and the intention to leave among 307 expat teachers in Southeast Asia during COVID-19 and highlights the importance of policy responses and social engagement toward the minimum teacher turnover rate. Findings: The study reveals that, the higher perceived policy responses and community engagement the teachers acknowledge, the lower chance they will move to another country. Also, this paper presents the differences in expat teachers' perceptions and intentions among demographic factors such as teaching qualification, their current country of teaching, experience at the current country, income before, during and expected income after COVID-19. Originality/value: The paper justifies a conceptual framework which provides a hypothetical explanation about the influence of perceived policy responses and community engagement over expat teachers' intention to leave."
"Estimation of environmental emissions and impacts of building construction – A decision making tool for contractors Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Building construction sites are responsible for significant energy consumption and emission production. The emissions at building construction stage vary from greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxides (CO2) to non-GHG emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) and sulphur dioxides (SO2). The construction emissions are often neglected due to the low amounts of emissions compared to high use phase emissions over the building life cycle. However studies have shown that these impacts from building construction can be significant at national and local level. Several difficulties and complications in estimation have restrained the possibility of effective decision making to minimise these emissions. Stakeholders in the construction industry seek the necessity of an emission calculation tool that enables the decision making in construction related emissions with minimum effort. The Construction Emission Evaluation Tool (CEET) presented in the study allows designers and contractors to estimate and compare emissions from the major emission sources in building construction. Emission analyses at project, equipment and activity levels provide in-depth scrutiny of emissions in minimising emissions and assisting the decision making for effective resource planning. Foundation construction corresponding to a case study is presented to demonstrate the functions and the capabilities of the developed calculation tool. The tool can provide a strong basis for the construction industry stakeholders and related researchers to make better decisions in maintaining a sustainable work environment. The study is also the initial step towards developing a sustainable decision making tool that can optimise cost, emissions and other construction related issues."
"Witch hunts and scapegoats: an investigation into the impact of personal liability concerns on engineers’ reporting of risks Whistleblowing; Personnel; Fraud Previous research in the health, aviation, and construction sectors, principally with operators, has found that individual blame for small failures discourages hazard and incident reporting and so adversely impacts disaster prevention. This finding has widely influenced practice in organizations relying on engineers, although the extent to which it applies to this work domain has been subject to limited empirical research. Based on a survey of Australian engineers (n = 275), in this article we examine how personal legal liability considerations impact on hazard and incident reporting and the less formal practice of telling stories about events. We found that 48% of engineers are more likely to report hazards as a result of their personal liability concerns. Only 5% indicated that they were less likely to report hazards. We suggest that these findings are due to the nature of engineering work, where decision-making is distributed across time, place, and people. In this context, reporting and informally telling of risks and hazards to others in the organization is understood to transfer responsibility for remedial action and so limit oneâ€™s personal liability. While there is some trepidation among engineers as to whether this strategy, among other work practices, will be sufficient protection, they see this as acting professionally and as such the â€˜rightâ€™ thing to do."
"Bee representations in human art and culture through the ages Bombus; Bees; Neonicotinoids The field of bioaesthetics seeks to understand how modern humans may have first developed art appreciation and is informed by considering a broad range of fields including painting, sculpture, music and the built environment. In recent times there has been a diverse range of art and communication media representing bees, and such work is often linked to growing concerns about potential bee declines due to a variety of factors including natural habitat fragmentation, climate change, and pesticide use in agriculture. We take a broad view of human art representations of bees to ask if the current interest in artistic representations of bees is evidenced throughout history, and in different regions of the world prior to globalisation. We observe from the earliest records of human representations in cave art over 8,000 years old through to ancient Egyptian carvings of bees and hieroglyphics, that humans have had a long-term relationship with bees especially due to the benefits of honey, wax, and crop pollination. The relationship between humans and bees frequently links to religious and spiritual representations in different parts of the world from Australia to Europe, South America and Asia. Art mediums have frequently included the visual and musical, thus showing evidence of being deeply rooted in how different people around the world perceive and relate to bees in nature through creative practice. In modern times, artistic representations extend to installation arts, mixed-media, and the moving image. Through the examination of the diverse inclusion of bees in human culture and art, we show that there are links between the functional benefits of associating with bees, including sourcing sweet-tasting nutritious food that could have acted, we suggest, to condition positive responses in the brain, leading to the development of an aesthetic appreciation of work representing bees."
"Environmental and anthropogenic influences on ambient background concentrations of fluoride in soil Fluorides; Pollution; Euphausia Superba Excess exposure to fluoride causes substantive health burden in humans and livestock globally. However, few studies have assessed the distribution and controls of variability of ambient background concentrations of fluoride in soil. Ambient background concentrations of fluoride in soil were collated for Greater Melbourne, Greater Geelong, Ballarat and Mitchell in Victoria, Australia (n = 1005). Correlation analysis and machine learning techniques were used to identify environmental and anthropogenic influences of fluoride variability in soil. Sub-soils (>0.3 m deep), in some areas overlying siltstone and sandstone, and to a lesser extent, overlying basalt, were naturally enriched with fluoride at concentrations above ecological thresholds for grazing animals. Soil fluoride enrichment was predominantly influenced by parent material (mineralogy), precipitation (illuviation), leaching during palaeoclimates and marine inputs. Industrial air pollution did not significantly influence ambient background concentrations of fluoride at a regional scale. However, agricultural practices (potentially the use of phosphate fertilisers) were indicated to have resulted in added fluoride to surface soils overlying sediments. Geospatial variables alone were not sufficient to accurately model ambient background soil fluoride concentrations. A multiple regression model based on soil chemistry and parent material was shown to accurately predict ambient background fluoride concentrations in soils and support assessment of fluoride enrichment in the environment. Few studies have assessed environmental/anthropogenic controls of background fluoride concentrations at a regional scale (e.g. not associated with a key point source of contamination). For the first time, a geochemical regression tree model for the estimation of ambient background fluoride concentrations in soil has been developed and is shown to have promise for application for predicting areas of fluoride enrichment/risk in soils."
"Catalytic upgrading of holocellulose-derived C5 and C6 sugars Biomass; Levulinic Acids; Ethyl Levulinate Biorefineries are a new concept in chemical manufacturing in which naturally occurring, sustainable biomass resources such as forestry and agricultural waste are converted to diverse fuel and chemical product streams, akin to the processing of non-renewable fossil fuels by petrochemical refineries. Polysaccharides are attractive potential feedstocks for biorefineries, with the transformation of C5 and C6 sugars offering routes to the production of fine, bulk, and platform chemicals typically produced via petrochemical routes. The transformation of biomass-derived building blocks will require different processes to those currently employed in the petrochemical industry, wherein highly functional biomolecules are selectively deoxygenated to their target product, which requires new classes of catalyst that are compatible with hydrophilic, bulky substrates. Here, we review recent advances in the design and development of catalysts and processes for C5-C6 sugar reforming into chemical intermediates and products and highlight the challenges of aqueous phase operation and catalyst evaluation, in addition to process considerations such as solvent and reactor selection."
"The social practices of hosting P2P social dining events: insights for sustainable tourism Platforms; Collaborative Consumption; Peer to Peer In many ways, the expansion of commercial for-profit, P2P social dining platforms has mirrored those within mobility and accommodation sectors. However its dynamics and impacts have received less consideration to date, with a notable paucity of attention to the hosts of social dining events. The aim of this paper is to address this research lacuna. Through its exploration of the social dining platforms VizEat in Athens and Eatwith in Barcelona, this paper identifies, analyses and compares the social practices of hosts around their social dining events in two key tourist destinations in Europe. Data is gathered through multiple methods from participating in and observing social dining events in each city to interviews with key stakeholders in the P2P social dining process (such as hosts, platform employees and ambassadors). The research reveals how dynamic rules, tools, skills and understandings shape and reshape the performance of hosting social dining events. It exposes tensions and ongoing negotiations between hosts and guests regarding matters of authenticity and privacy, an uneven risk burden between hosts and platforms with regards liability and scant regard for matters of sustainability. As a result there is little alignment between P2P social dining and the goals of sustainable tourism."
"Measurement and prediction of tunnelling-induced ground settlement in karst region by using expanding deep learning method Ground Settlement; Excavation; TBM This paper presents the measurement and prediction of the tunnelling-induced surface response in karst ground, Guangzhou, China. A predictive method of ground settlement is proposed named as the expanding deep learning method. This method kinetically uses the expanding tunnelling data to predict ground settlement in real time. Four types of deep learning methods are compared, including artificial neural network (ANN), long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM), gated recurrent unit neural networks (GRU), and 1d convolutional neural networks (Conv1d). Based on static Pearson correlation coefficient, a kinetic correlation analysis method is proposed to evaluate the variable significance of input data on the ground settlement. The effect of cemented karst caves and variable geological conditions are then analysed. The results indicate that the expanding Conv1d model precisely predict the tunnelling-induced ground settlement. The kinetic correlation analysis can reflect the variable influence of geological condition and tunnelling operation parameters on the ground settlement."
"Towards zero-energy buildings in China: A systematic literature review Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation Zero-energy buildings have attracted interest worldwide as they consume less energy and can alleviate energy shortages caused by rapid economic development. This paper presents a review of the research and development regarding zero-energy buildings in China. First, it briefly introduces the evolution of the definition of zero-energy buildings and discusses the key influencing factors of such buildings in China. Then, envelope design, selection of mechanical and electrical equipment, and solar energy utilization aspects of zero-energy buildings are examined. Additionally, this paper discusses the development and application of zero-energy buildings in China, including project types, design methods, energy resources allocation, and energy operation management. Finally, this paper analyzes China's policies for zero-energy buildings, including incentive mechanisms, laws and regulations, and problems encountered, and provides suggestions for promoting zero-energy buildings in China. We expect this review to identify gaps and future directions for research and development, which will lead to new technologies, methods, policies, and standards that can be applied to zero-energy buildings."
"Professionalisation of accounting in developing countries: 25 years of research Accounting Profession; Accountants; Professionalization Purpose: The purpose of this paper to systematically review and critique research on professional accounting development published in English during the last two-and-a-half decades. This paper focusses on developing countries (DCs) and suggests a future research agenda. In recent decades, many DCs have undergone reforms in the professionalisation of accounting (PA). Design/methodology/approach: Extant research articles are selected from major accounting journals between 1995 and 2020 for the review. A conceptual analysis of the selected literature is presented to evaluate the focus and scope of existing work. Findings: Previous empirical research on DCs has focused on the state and political ideology, religion and Sharia law, racial/class discrimination, colonialism and closure (e.g. the monopolisation of accounting work). Also, a complex set of globalisation, political, economic, and social contexts. In particular, a strong tradition of British accounting associations providing accounting qualifications in DCs is noted. Future research should aim to examine such issues as the politics of decolonisation, domination, neoliberalism, competition from Western professional associations, accounting in state-owned organisations, government accounting reforms, and social and environmental accounting issues. Research limitations/implications: This paper covers only PA research in high-ranked English language accounting journals and chapters of a monograph. Accounting research published in other languages and lower-ranked journals could be imperative sources as well but not included in this study. Originality/value: While PA has been explored in a variety of locations and from different perspectives in Western countries, a review in DCs was lacking."
"Fertility gap and child nutrition: Evidence from India Birth Rate; Childlessness; Postponement Using data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) of India, the authors examine the impact of fertility gap on child nutritional outcomes, focused on whether a child is stunted, wasted or anemic. They find that the odds of having malnourished children who are stunted, wasted or anemic are higher for women who exceed their fertility target compared to those who have achieved or underachieved it. The authors build on the literature that has emphasized the importance of lower fertility on development, and thus calls for policies that are aimed at achieving this."
"An early-stage project complexity assessment tool for the AEC industry Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management Purpose: Complex projects require careful management. They may expose stakeholders to greater risks and place additional demands upon resources. In the initial stages of project development, however, little may be known about the nature and magnitude of such complexity. This paper aims to ensure that this gap is at least subjectively assessed and addressed. Design/methodology/approach: Research, using focus group workshops with a convenience sample of construction professionals, was carried out to test the validity of a Project Early Stage Complexity Assessment Tool (PESCAT). The PESCAT concept brings together selected complexity theories and uses subjectively based measures for assessment. Findings: The findings confirm that an early-stage project complexity assessment tool is practicable and can contribute to project management practice in the construction industry. It should be applied by individual project stakeholders using small teams of experienced staff. PESCAT explores project complexity through â€œfilterâ€ sets of perspective factors which should be customised to reflect the stakeholderâ€™s role and processes in a project. Originality/value: In the initial complexity assessment model, resolution space and uncertainty were tested as project complexity parameters. However, in subsequent versions of the tool, four measures (differentiation and differentiation uncertainty; interdependency and interdependency uncertainty) are used in an innovative way that focuses usersâ€™ attention more clearly and points to a more targeted approach for addressing project complexity. The value of our model lies in its practical application and the project management benefits it can deliver."
"Scientometric review of construction demolition waste management: a global sustainability perspective Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management The increase in construction projects with rising construction demolition waste (CDW) challenges is alarming, and it poses a significant threat to sustainable urban development. The challenge of CDW management (CDWM) is noteworthy with varied consequences on social, economic, environmental, and physical development perspectives. Although there has been research from different perspectives on CDWM for over 40 years, there is a limited scientometric review research in these areas to date. This study, therefore, conducts a global scientometric analysis of CDWM articles to understand its sustainable development research approach for further studies. Article titles, keywords, and abstract search methods were used to extract related articles from the year 2000 to 2021. A total of 4374 articles retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection were analysed using CiteSpace software for scientometric analysis. The result revealed active research on CDWM from influential researchers, research institutes, institutions, reputable journals, and countries. The policy recommendations and frameworks adopted in the past have focused more on reducing, recycling and reuse (3R), and they adopt these strategies and others as single strategies for improving CDWM. These strategies are limited in integrating sustainable development strategies such as the circular economy and bio-dynamic. This study concludes that there is a need for a comprehensive research approach that incorporates the economic, social, and physical implications of CDWM to maximise the value of CDW for sustainable development. It presents a comprehensive scientometric analysis of the CDWM, adds to the existing knowledge of CDWM sustainability approach, and provides insights for future research direction relevant for the academics, professionals, and government agencies in CDWM projects."
"Circular Economy of Construction and Demolition Wood Waste—A Theoretical Framework Approach Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management A considerable amount of construction and demolition wood waste (CDWW) is generated, mostly landfilled, contributing to severe environmental effects. The management of CDWW is a significant challenge as it is a hazardous contaminated waste. In this context, the circular economy (CE) concept is a solution as it comprises waste minimisation and efficient recovery of resources. Although much research is found in the literature on CDWW end-of-life management, research on CE implementation considering every life cycle stage is still scarce. In this review, we endeavour to integrate CE in CDWW to identify the waste management strategies involved in the life cycle phases. The databases were searched from 2009 to 2020 and were analysed using CiteSpace version 5.7.R1 software. Forty-nine articles were identified, and the six life cycle stages were explored. The analysis shows that CE for wood waste is essential and has greater growth potential. While the LCA studies are limited to environmental viewpoints, combining economic and social perspectives is necessary for sustainable development. Overall, based on the research findings, a theoretical framework was proposed. This study, as a consequence, promotes the application of recycled wood into multiple valuable products and thus encourages waste management to boost CE and sustainability."
"Privacy preserving service selection using fully homomorphic encryption scheme on untrusted cloud service platform Web Service Composition; Service Selection; Web Service In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving service selection framework for cloud-based service systems. In the cloud-based service system, a cloud provider selects the best service from a set of services based on their Quality-of-Service (QoS) information. The QoS information of services is sensitive from the service provider's point of view. We claim that the service selection process in the cloud can be biased. A service provider can bribe a dishonest employee of the cloud provider for taking unfair advantage during a service selection process. Therefore, it is important to execute the service selection tasks keeping QoS information private. We use a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme in this paper for encrypting QoS values. Service selection task is performed by the cloud provider on encrypted QoS values to ensure privacy. In order to reduce computation overhead, we propose a MapReduce model for parallel execution. We conduct several experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed privacy preserving service selection framework using synthetic QoS dataset."
"Scenarios of energy reduction potential of zero energy building promotion in the Asia-Pacific region to year 2050 Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation Building energy consumption in the Asia-Pacific region continues to rise. It is important to understand the energy use and future trends of 21 members of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and to find more effective ways to achieve APEC's dual goals of reducing energy intensity by 45% of 2005 levels by 2035 and doubling the share of renewable energy in the energy mix between 2010 and 2030. Recently, promoting building toward ultra-low energy, nearly zero energy and zero energy is becoming a consensus trend. This paper aims to explore how zero energy building promotion could influence the total energy demand in the mid to long term. An EUPP (Economic, Urbanization, Population and Purchasing power parity) model was established to show the relationship between building energy consumption and its influencing factors, and the potential development path of building energy consumption in APEC was predicted by using the model. The results show that in the Business As Usual (BAU) model, building energy demand will increase from 1387.4 Mtoe in 2016 to 2456.8 Mtoe in 2050 while in the CAP model, building energy demand will be constrained to under 2000 Mtoe before 2050. In the ZEB promotion model, 897.8 to 1945.3 Mtoe could be saved separately. The share of end demand supplied by onsite renewable energy production could reach 11%â€“54%. The building sector has the potential to become the largest contributor to achieve the APEC energy goal and thus to the climate change goal."
"Nutrient removal by alginate-immobilized Chlorella vulgaris: response to different wastewater matrices Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water BACKGROUND: Immobilized algae are a promising tool to treat wastewater within a short time (<12 h) and simplify biomass harvesting compared with suspended algae. The potential of alginate-entrapped Chlorella vulgaris to bioremediate secondary (with and without nutrient supplementation), primary and two lagoon municipal wastewaters was investigated. The capability of the system to adapt to these wastewaters was analysed by determining biotic and abiotic nutrient removal, and further evaluated by comparison with suspended cells. RESULTS: The algal nitrogen (N) content (4.6â€“7.8 wt%) was closely related to the wastewater ammonium concentration (R2 = 0.97). The algal cells did not adapt N uptake as effectively to wastewater nitrate concentration because both abiotic N and phosphorus (P) removal increased. The algal P content (1.2â€“3.2 wt%) varied in response to the wastewater P and was inversely related to the initial cellular P content. The algae thus adapted nutrient uptake to the wastewater N:P level and ratio when ammonium predominated. Biomass production (35â€“73 mg L-1 d-1) increased with dissolved organic and inorganic carbon with little impact from other wastewater characteristics. Immobilization did not affect N and P uptake per cell compared with suspended algae. CONCLUSION: Decoupling biotic and abiotic removal showed adaptation to the N:P of the wastewater and luxury P uptake had significant impact during treatment of different wastewater matrices, these traits were not affected by immobilization. Immobilization enables increased N and P removal rates compared with suspended algal systems as nutrient uptake per cell is not affected and higher concentrations of algal biomass within the reactor are facilitated.

"Carbon sequestration value of biosolids applied to soil: A global meta-analysis Soil Organic Carbon; China; Carbon Sinks Biosolids produced at wastewater treatment facilities are extensively used in agricultural land and degraded mine sites to improve soil health and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Many studies have reported increases in SOC due to application of biosolids to such sites. However, lack of a comprehensive quantification on overall trends and changes of magnitude in SOC remains. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to identify drivers with a relationship with SOC stocks. A meta-regression of 297 treatments found four variables with a relationship with SOC stocks: cumulative biosolids carbon (C) input rate, time after application, soil depth and type of biosolids. The cumulative biosolids C input rate was the most influencing driver. The highest mean difference for SOC% of 3.3 was observed at 0â€“15 cm soil depth for a cumulative C input of 100 Mg haâˆ’1 at one year after biosolids application. Although years after biosolids application demonstrated a negative relationship with SOC stocks, mineralization of C in biosolids-applied soils is slow, as indicated with the SOC% decrease from 4.6 to 2.8 at 0â€“15 cm soil depth over five years of 100 Mg haâˆ’1 biosolids C input. Soil depth illustrated a strong negative effect with SOC stocks decreasing by 2.7% at 0â€“15 cm soil depth at a cumulative biosolids C input of 100 Mg haâˆ’1 over a year. Overall, our model estimated an effect of 2.8 SOC% change, indicating the application of biosolids as a viable strategy for soil C sequestration on a global scale."
"Early delivery of equitable and healthy transport options in new suburbs: Policy, place and people Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Introduction: Planning policies support the development of healthy, liveable cities. Yet, recent research suggests they may not offer enough detail to provide on-the-ground delivery of social and transport infrastructure that supports and impacts healthy, active behaviours and the subjective wellbeing of residents in new developments and growth areas. Methods: Three analyses were conducted. First, planning policies were reviewed using a content analysis to identify environmental features known to support healthy and active behaviours. Then, for two growth area estates located in Melbourne, Australia (Allura and Selandra Rise), the on-the-ground delivery of these planning policies were evaluated using spatial data of key destinations (e.g., shops, schools, and transport) and geographic information systems analysis. Finally, the health and subjective wellbeing of adult residents from these two estates combined (n = 352) was assessed using survey methodology. This included asking residents about the importance and satisfaction with access to transport and key destinations. Results: We found that many built environment features were mentioned in the policy documents; however policy standards for dwelling density remain low at 15 dph and distances for accessing activity centres too long at 1 km to adequately support the walkability of new growth areas. We found generally, that average distances to key destinations were longer and more variable in growth areas in comparison to inner city areas and Greater Melbourne overall. For residents, satisfaction with access to destinations differed between the two case study areas. Residents in Allura, where destination and transport access was generally poorer were less satisfied, whilst those in the more walkable and established Selandra Rise area were more satisfied. Conclusions: Although planning policies support the development of active transport and healthy, liveable cities they are insufficient for influencing healthy behaviours when not well implemented. Early delivery of social and transport infrastructure and services must occur early in the development cycle of new growth areas to support healthier and more sustainable behaviours."
"Mechanisms underlying exposure to partner violence and children's emotional-behavioral difficulties Adverse Childhood Experiences; Maltreatment; Child Abuse Intimate partner violence (IPV) between parents can have a serious impact on children's health, well-being, and development. This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal associations between exposure to IPV in the first year postpartum and children's emotional-behavioral well-being at age 10 years, where maternal depressive symptoms and involvement in home learning activities at 4 years mediate this relationship. A second aim was to test for the moderating effects of child gender and economic disadvantage. Data were drawn from 1,385 Australian mothers and children participating in the Maternal Health Study; a prospective longitudinal study of women's health after childbirth. Results revealed that IPV in the first year postpartum was associated with higher maternal depressive symptoms at 4 years postpartum, which was, in turn, associated with children's emotional-behavioral difficulties at age 10 years. These associations remained significant after adjusting for concurrent exposure to IPV and maternal depressive symptoms at 10 years. There was no evidence of moderation by child gender, but there was for economic disadvantage. The associations between early life exposure to IPV, maternal depressive symptoms, and children's emotional-behavioral difficulties were stronger for families experiencing economic disadvantage, while the associations between IPV, maternal involvement, and children's emotional-behavioral difficulties were stronger for those not experiencing disadvantage. These findings can inform prevention and early intervention practices and policies aimed at providing adequate mental health support to women experiencing IPV to minimize the negative impact on children."
"Do differences in social environments explain gender differences in recreationalwalking across neighbourhoods? Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Within a city, gender differences in walking for recreation (WfR) vary significantly across neighbourhoods, although the reasons remain unknown. This cross-sectional study investigated the contribution of the social environment (SE) to explaining such variation, using 2009 data from the How Areas in Brisbane Influence healTh and AcTivity (HABITAT) study, including 7866 residents aged 42â€“67 years within 200 neighbourhoods in Brisbane, Australia (72.6% response rate). The analytical sample comprised 200 neighbourhoods and 6643 participants (mean 33 per neighbourhood, range 8â€“99, 95% CI 30.6â€“35.8). Self-reported weekly minutes of WfR were categorised into 0 and 1â€“840 mins. The SE was conceptualised through neighbourhood-level perceptions of social cohesion, incivilities and safety from crime. Analyses included multilevel binomial logistic regression with gender as main predictor, adjusting for age, socioeconomic position, residential self-selection and neighbourhood disadvantage. On average, women walked more for recreation than men prior to adjustment for covariates. Gender differences in WfR varied significantly across neighbourhoods, and the magnitude of the variation for women was twice that of men. The SE did not explain neighbourhood differences in the genderâ€“WfR relationship, nor the between-neighbourhood variation in WfR for men or women. Neighbourhood-level factors seem to influence the WfR of men and women differently, with women being more sensitive to their environment, although Brisbaneâ€™s SE did not seem such a factor."
"“I Don’t Think My Landlord Will Find Out:” Airbnb and the Challenges of Enforcement Homelessness; Revanchism; Poverty Airbnb is an established part of the platform economy, which in many cities is operating unregulated. Some jurisdictions, however, have started regulating this sector, even imposing bans on short-term rentals (STR). Where regulatory limits have been instituted, local officials identify enforcement as a challenge. Amidst the dearth of enforcement resources, some local councils are turning to private companies, thereby introducing private enforcement which does not sit well in the planning (public) law context. We query whether traditional enforcement strategies can even succeed in the platform economy of STRs and whether alternatives to STR regulation make for a more realistic approach."
"Sustainable and renewable bio-based natural fibres and its application for 3d printed concrete: A review Mechanical Properties; Sisal; Coir The concept of sustainability and the utilization of renewable bio-based sources have gained prominent attention in the construction industry. Material selection in construction plays a significant role in design and manufacturing process of sustainable building construction. Several studies are being carried out worldwide to investigate the potential use of natural fibres as reinforcement in concrete with its noticeable environmental benefits and mechanical properties. 3D printed concrete (3DPC) is another emerging technology, which has been under-developed for the past decade. The integration of reinforcement is one of the major challenges in the application of this new technology in real-life scenario. Presently, artificial fibres have been used as a reinforcement material for this special printable concrete mixture. However, natural fibre composites have received significant attention by many 3DPC constructions due to their lightweight energy conservation and environmentally friendly nature. These benchmarking characteristics unlock the wider area of natural fibres into the composite sector and challenge the substitution of artificial fibres. Hence, this paper presents a comprehensive review on the current practice and advantages of natural fibres in conventional concrete construction. Subsequently, with a view to the future efficient 3DPC construction, the potentials of natural fibres such as eco-friendly, higher impact, thermal, structural, and fire performance over the artificial fibres were highlighted, and their applicability in 3DPC as composites was recommended."
"Spending to save: What will it cost to halt Australia's extinction crisis? Endangered Species Act; Environmental Protection; Tympanuchus Pallidicinctus As with most governments worldwide, Australian governments list threatened species and proffer commitments to recovering them. Yet most of Australia's imperiled species continue to decline or go extinct and a contributing cause is inadequate investment in conservation management. However, this has been difficult to evaluate because the extent of funding committed to such recovery in Australia, like in many nations, is opaque. Here, by collating disparate published budget figures of Australian governments, we show that annual spending on targeted threatened species recovery is around U.S.$92m (AU$122m) which is around one tenth of that spent by the U.S. endangered species recovery program, and about 15% of what is needed to avoid extinctions and recover threatened species. Our approach to estimating funding needs for species recovery could be applied in any jurisdiction and could be scaled up to calculate what is needed to achieve international goals for ending the species extinction crisis."
"Sustainability and depth of outreach: Evidence from microfinance institutions in sub-Saharan Africa Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion The feasibility of microfinance institutions (MFIs) to expand outreach to the poorest while remaining financially sustainable has long been debated. Using data from 206 MFIs in 33 African countries, we adopt the three-stage least square technique to assess whether a trade-off exists between sustainability and outreach depth. Our results confirm the existence of a trade-off. The evidence also supports ongoing subsidies for MFIs with the aim of encouraging outreach. In addition, we examine whether there is an inflection point beyond which higher interest rates reduce profitability for MFIs. We find no evidence of a threshold beyond which profitability is reduced."
"Presence and characterization of microplastics in fish of commercial importance from the Biobío region in central Chile Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter In this study we have identified and characterized microplastic particles (MPs) found in six fish species of commercial importance in central Chile. The fish species belong to different trophic levels and were obtained from the oceanic and coastal habitats. To analyze MPs, the fish gastrointestinal content was extracted, analyzed and characterized using a microscopy equipped with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The MPs found in fish samples were mainly constituted by red microfibers (70â€“100%) with sizes ranging between 176 and 2842 Î¼m. Polyester, polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were identified as the prevalent polymers detected. The coastal species showed the presence of microfibers with a higher size and abundance (71%) compared to oceanic species (29%), suggesting there is a greater exposure risk. These findings are consistent with results found in other investigations worldwide. However, further research is still needed to accurately establish the potential exposure risk for the public consuming these fish and the impact of MPs in the Chilean fishery activities."
"Environmental isotopes as indicators of groundwater recharge, residence times and salinity in a coastal urban redevelopment precinct in Australia Landfill Leachates; Leaching; Municipal Solid Waste Fishermans Bend is an urban redevelopment precinct situated on the Yarra River estuary in Melbourne, Australia. Understanding the hydrogeological system is important for characterising the impacts from legacy contamination and for monitoring the effects of urbanisation on groundwater flow systems and quality. Stable isotopes of water (Î´18O, Î´2H) and carbon (Î´13C), radioisotopes (3H, 14C) and other geochemical indicators were used to assess sources of water and salinity in the shallow groundwater. Groundwater in the upper aquifer was predominantly Ca-HCO3 âˆ’ dominant, with fresh to brackish salinityâ€”189â€“3,680 mg/L total dissolved solids (TDS). Localised areas of Ca-SO4 2âˆ’ and Na-HCO3 âˆ’ dominant groundwater were impacted by industrial activities and legacy landfills, respectively. Stable isotopes (e.g. Î´18O âˆ’5.7 to âˆ’2.9â€°) and tritium activities (1.75â€“2.45 TU) within the aquifer indicate meteoric water recharged by modern rainfall with short residence times. Carbonate dissolution from shell material, and decay of organic waste and methanogenesis in landfill-leachate-impacted bores were shown to enrich Î´13C values up to âˆ’4.2â€°. In contrast, groundwater in the adjacent/lower aquitard was Na-Cl dominant and saline (19,600â€“23,900 mg/L TDS), with molar ratios reflective of ocean water, indicating relict emplaced salts. This is consistent with 14C dating of shell material, indicating deposition in a Holocene marine environment. The presence of tritium above background levels (0.20â€“0.35 TU) in the groundwater, however, suggests a component of modern recharge. Salinity fluctuations within the aquitard at times of peak river level suggest the modern water source is ingress from the adjacent Yarra River."
"Design, synthesis and application of new iron-based cockscomb-like photocatalyst for high effectively degrading water contaminant under sunlight Cyanogen; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Photocatalysts Developing cheap and efficient photocatalyst is a vigorous pathway for gradually increasing rhodamine B (RhB) pollution problem. Herein, two novel iron-based photocatalysts g-C3N4/ZnO@Fe3O4 (Fe-heterojunction) and 2-amino-5-fluorobenzotrifluoride@Fe3O4 (Fe-organic ligand) were designed and synthesized which exhibit 100% photo-degradative ability with water contaminant RhB under sunlight in about 2 h. They were characterized by SEM, FT-IR, XRD, XPS and BET as well as the analysis of morphological structure and chemical composition. The ESR experiment was also carried out to explore the possible degradation mechanism. The UV-Vis spectrum and band gap energies were examined and calculated. Especially, the Fe-organic ligand photocatalyst shows a specific 3D cockscomb-like structure. This makes its degrading efficiency much improved. The recently developed robust field-only surface integral method was employed to explore the possible mechanism which confirmed with the experimental results. The optimum degradation conditions including ligand ratio, pH and concentration of RhB solution, were screened by orthogonal experiments. Also, the reusability and degradation kinetic equations of the two photocatalysts were built to give a typical reference for a large-scale industrial wastewater treatment as well as for the water sustainable utilization."
"Healthcare service, food security, and sustainable development: Main reasons to grow opium poppy in Myanmar Rohingya (People); Military Government; Junta This chapter aims to analyze discrimination and disadvantage of local farmers in the process of opium eradication in Myanmar based on their specific explanations. The author utilizes some data and information collected from official reports and statements of the Myanmar Opium Farmers' Forum (2013-2018). Some multiple sources from inside and outside Myanmar in terms of human rights of ethnic minorities' opium farmers are also added. The current findings point out that there are a number of concerns and disadvantages with local opium farmers to look for survival livelihood, food security, and sustainable development in ethnic minorities' communities in Myanmar, particularly at Shan and Kachin States. The chapter also calls for further researches with specific recommendations and effective solutions for local opium farmers in the next stages."
"The effects of free-fare public transportation on the total active travel in children: A cross-sectional comparison between two Finnish towns Report Cards; Mode Choice; Built Environment Background: Free-fare public transport policies potentially increase walking to transport stops, but may replace other active travel modes with unknown effects on total active travel. We compared active travel behaviour of children living in a Finnish city with a free-fare public transport to a reference city. Methods: Children were recruited from primary school grades 4â€“6 in 21 participating schools, located in 11 neighborhood pairs from Mikkeli (free-fare bus) and Kouvola (no free-fare bus). Children marked all places they visited the previous week, visit frequency, and travel modes into a participatory mapping survey during a lesson. Active travel was assessed as a sum of all round-trips from home to destination by walking (4 km/h), walking-to-bus-stop, skating/scooting (7 km/h) and cycling (10 km/h). Active travel was compared between cities with linear mixed effects models. Results: A total of 427 children respondents (age mean and SD 11.0 Â± 0.8 years) marked altogether 2445 places. On average they visited 5.7 Â± 2.2 places 13.8 Â± 7.2 times during the week. Median trip distance was 521 m by walking, 1794 m by bike, and 730 m by walking to bus stop. A total of 23.3% and 43.5% of children in Mikkeli (bus 6.4%; bike 30.0% of all trips) and 12.9% and 59.2% in Kouvola (bus 2.1%; bike 44.5% of all trips) marked â‰¥5 bus and cycling trips per week, respectively (city p â‰¤ 0.006). Children in Mikkeli gained more active travel from walking to bus stops, and children in Kouvola from cycling (P < 0.001). Estimated total active travel was 3.19 h/week (95% CI 2.62â€“3.83) in Mikkeli and 3.33 h/week (2.74â€“3.97) in Kouvola (P = 0.749). Conclusions: Children living in a Finnish city with free-fare bus cycle less, but walk more to bus stops, and have a similar total active travel duration as compared to children who do not have a free-fare bus option for all their everyday trips. Walking to public transport is a significant source of active travel and free-fare policy can facilitate this behaviour."
"Australia's gambling epidemic and energy poverty Pathological Gambling; Sports Betting; Casino Energy poverty is a growing concern across many countries due to rising energy costs. Energy affordability is essential for households to be able to pay their bills and adequately heat their homes. Here we consider the relationship between energy poverty and gambling. Problem gambling is an increasing societal issue in many countries. Gambling is addictive for many players and at its extreme excessive gambling consumption can lead to multiple economic and social harms. One domain of huge importance is the financial hardship that gambling can create. We utilise the Household, Income and Laboure Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) data to investigate if problem gambling is a driver of energy poverty. We employ a range of energy poverty measures and gambling behaviour proxies. Our findings show subjective measures of energy poverty are positively associated with gambling expenditure. This finding captures the negative impacts of excessive gambling on an individual's ability to pay their energy bills and heat their homes."
"Effects of salinity on the growth and nutrition of taro (Colocasia esculenta): Implications for food security Salt Tolerance; Sodium Proton Exchange Protein; Salinity Taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott) is a staple food crop in the Asia-Pacific region in areas where rising sea levels are threatening agricultural production. However, little is known about its response to salinity. In this study, we investigated the effects of salinity on the growth, morphology, physiology, and chemical traits of taro to predict the impacts of rising sea levels on taro production and nutritional value in the Pacific. We grew taro (approximately 4 months old) with a range of NaCl treatments (0â€“200 mM) for 12 weeks. Full nutrient, micronutrient, and secondary metabolite analyses were conducted, including measures of calcium oxalate (CaOx), an irritant that reduces palatability. Significant reductions in growth and biomass were observed at and above 100 mM NaCl. Concentrations of macro-and micronutrients, including sodium, were higher on a per mass basis in corms of plants experiencing salt stress. Foliar sodium concentrations remained stable, indicating that taro may utilize a salt exclusion mechanism. There was a large amount of individual variation in the concentrations of oxalate and phenolics, but overall, the concentrations were similar in the plants grown with different levels of salt. The total contents of CaOx and phenolics decreased in plants experiencing salt stress. Taroâ€™s ability to survive and produce corms when watered with a 200 mM NaCl solution places it among the salt-tolerant non-halophytes. The nutritional quality of the crop is only marginally affected by salt stress. Taro is, therefore, likely to remain a useful staple in the Pacific region in the future."
"The financial challenges for Australian nursing students attending placement-based work-integrated learning. Rural Health; Workforce; MONASH Model Background: Mandatory placement-based work-integrated learning (WIL) poses challenges for nursing students who work whilst studying. The financial burden of WIL links to other known direct and indirect challenges, yet no Australian study has quantified the financial challenges resulting from attending mandatory WIL placements. Placement-based WIL costs may preclude some students from completing WIL, which may impact student attrition and the future health workforce. Aim: To investigate Australian nursing studentsâ€™ financial challenges related to mandatory WIL. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey conducted with nursing students from nine Australian universities across five Australian states. The 28-question survey investigated the location of, and travels to, the most recent WIL placement; and studentsâ€™ employment, accommodation, financial support, expenses and debts, and financial strain pertaining to WIL placements. Results: Overall, 2,359 students participated. The majority were employed (84%); 65% of these reported that they were unable to work during WIL, affecting their employment. One-third incurred a financial liability from their placement, 79% reported financial hardship, and 73% found their placement stressful due to financial strain. Financial issues affected 62% of studentsâ€™ health and wellbeing. Discussion: Financial pressures related to WIL impact nursing students. While students have strategies to reduce these pressures, universities can also better manage their placement preferencing and support of students to reduce financial impacts of placement-based WIL on students. Conclusions: Nursing students face substantial financial challenges related to placement-based WIL. Scholarship programs and other forms of support are required to assist nursing students to undertake WIL."
"The effect of rutin on the early-age hydration of oil well cement at varying temperatures Penicillins; Calcium Sulfate; Penicillin Derivative This paper studied the effect of rutin on the early-age hydration of oil well cement when the rutin concentration was in the range of 0â€“0.075% and the temperature was in the range of 60 Â°Câ€“80 Â°C. The adsorption of rutin on cement particles and the effects of rutin on the thickening time and hydration heat of cement paste were analyzed. The results revealed that rutin had a strong adsorption energy and adsorption capacity for cement particles, prolonging the induction period of cement hydration and the thickening time of cement paste. The adsorption capacity of rutin on cement particles increased linearly with the increase of equilibrium concentration of rutin. High temperature reduced the adsorption energy and adsorption capacity of rutin, and shortened the thickening time of cement paste. In addition, the compressive strength, pore structure and hydration products of hardened cement pastes (HCPs) were studied. The delay of the early hydration (within 48 h) of cement by rutin decreased the one-day compressive strength of HCP at 60 Â°C and 70 Â°C. However, the compressive strengths of HCPs containing rutin met the cementing demand. At 80 Â°C, 0.075% dosage of rutin had no significant effect on the compressive strength and provided enough thickening time for well cementing. The results proved that rutin can be used as an environmentally friendly retarder for oil well cement."
"Determining the potential role of the waste sector in decoupling of phosphorus: A comprehensive review of national scale substance flow analyses Struvite; Waste Water; Phosphorus This study, the first of its kind, presents a comprehensive assessment of national scale phosphorus (P) flow in the waste sector with particular focus on P recovery. The largest inflow of P in waste stream is seen in China (8124 kt), with the next largest inflow, the USA, being significantly less at 431 kt. Countries through east Asia and western Europe tend to show moderate inflows, e.g. Japan (131.66 kt), France (115.70 kt), UK (76 kt) and South Korea (65.40 kt), while northern European nations have low P inflows, Denmark (10 kt), Sweden (10 kt) and Norway (6.70 kt). The most efficient recovery rate of P from the waste sector is seen to be in Finland (67.50%). Denmark (53.70%), France (47.80%) and UK (47.40%), all have commendable recovery tracks. Even though USA has the second largest inflow of P, their recovery track is one of the lowest (2 kt), making its recycling efficiency minute (0.50%), while with a recovery of 3148 kt P, this is 39% for China. This study has also calculated the substitutability of each country's recycled P waste in minimizing extraction of virgin P resource/importing P, as found to be the highest in China (49.40). The UK and Sweden have the second and third highest substitutability of 26.10 and 19.80 respectively, while the Netherlands (1.40) and USA (0.05) have the lowest. This study can be used as a guideline for future research on P recovery from waste because it provides a comprehensive blueprint of P flow in this sector and prescribes a general framework for better recovery."
"Reimagining co-design on Country as a relational and transformational practice Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work Undertaking participatory work with Indigenous people requires a reflexive and critical reimagining of how non-Indigenous design researchers engage with place. This paper draws upon reflexive learnings from a co-design education programme with young adults from Ntaria, Western Arrarnta Country in the Central Desert of Australia. Co-designing with Ntaria youth involved deeper questioning of the dynamics of participation, catalysing a change of pace and a shift from engaging as a Design Researcher and Educator to a person open to different ways of relating. This embodied transformation required leaning into uncertainty and discomfort as a new practice of waiting and becoming relational, attuned to the temporal rhythms of people and â€˜Countryâ€™. While the stories are highly personal and contextually specific, the paper aims to inspire others to reflect and question alternative ways of being a design researcher. By shifting away from de-personalised accounts of research that emphasises roles, skills, processes, and methodologies, this paper reimagines co-design as co-ontological ways of becoming, which troubles research traditions of replicability and generalisability. For co-design to be reimagined this way, we argue the significance of onto-epistemes that are beyond dominant research orthodoxies to respect and embrace pluriversal ways of participating, learning, and teaching design."
"Traffic management for drones flying in the city Helicopter; A-6 Aircraft; Airspace Air Traffic Management (ATM) is designed based on the notion of a pilot navigating an aircraft from within the aircraft. Increasing demand for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) usage and its safe integration into segregated/non-segregated airspace, on the other hand, have raised a question on the adoption of the current ATM for the UAS Traffic Management (UTM). The Procedures for Air Navigation Services-Air Traffic Management (PAN-ATM) and Procedures for Air Navigation Services - aircraft operations (PAN-OPS) rules are both developed for manned flight operations. Therefore, this work (i) defines the UTM system and describes its envisioned functionalities; (ii) performs an exploratory research to identify the distinctions between a manned and an unmanned flight operation and consequently the possible challenges to implement UTM with regard to the ATM; (iii) discusses potential Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) technologies to support the UTM system; and (iv) proposes an architectural framework for UTM based on the findings. It is important to highlight that this work is developed based on the assumption that the UAS will operate in the class G airspace (500 ft and below) in urban areas where the UAS are exposed to various obstacles such as static objects: high-rise buildings, trees, lamp posts, over-ground rail tracks and dynamic objects: cranes."
"Identity management in disaster response environments: A child exploitation mitigation perspective Climate Change; Decision to Migrate; Small Islands The immediate disaster response environment exposes people to a multitude of risks, including identity risks. Those working in disaster response environments use identity management systems to protect people, especially vulnerable people and children. This paper examines identity management systems and the way they address risks of child trafficking and exploitation. This research offers a unique perspective into the experiences of non-state actors and the role they play in identity management systems during disaster response. A case study of Tropical Cyclone Winston is used to explore views of identity management and how they reduce risks to children. The case study showed that the role of the community in identity management, verification and associated controls were geographically concentrated and not readily portable. This created risks to children of trafficking and exploitation, particularly where evacuation centres and shelters were geographically removed from the children's communities. An Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork method revealed that those working in the disaster response environment rely heavily on information from the community and government when identifying children. Where there are gaps in the information and social networks in the identity management process there are significant risks to children. These insights are relevant to disaster response planning."
"Improving Well-Being in Bhutan: A Pursuit of Happiness or Poverty Reduction? Subjective Well-Being; Happiness; Life Satisfaction Increasing happiness is a key priority for the Bhutanese government. This priority displaces more traditional (economic) objectives such as the pursuit of income growth and the reduction of income poverty. This paper examines the implications of this approach by examining whether there are common correlates of the four following measures of human well-being in Bhutan: income poverty; multidimensional poverty; perceived poverty; and happiness. Our findings suggest that whilst there is a degree of commonality, determinants of the different measures of well-being are distinct. Common factors include having a savings account, levels of literacy and household size. Further we show that higher levels of income poverty, multidimensional poverty and perceived poverty are found to be negatively associated with happiness. Importantly, our findings suggest that a focus on increasing happiness might come at the expense of improving other measures of wellbeing."
"Review of research for two decades for women leadership in higher education around the world and in Vietnam: a comparative analysis Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to find the studies conducted on women leadership in higher education (WLHE) in the past 20 years to understand as to how the trend has changed over the past two decades around the world and particularly in Vietnam for women leaders in higher education institutions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a systematic review of 93 articles published in the past 20 years in WLHE. The articles were classified based on the country of research and the research methods used. Findings: The study concluded that most of the research in WLHE had been done in the USA and Canada, with a dearth of literature on WLHE in Asia, and only six studies so far have been done in Vietnam, with only two studies being done before 2017. Vietnam is gaining importance in research in WLHE may be because of the increased female labour participation rate and growth in the gross domestic product. Practical implications: This study provided some recommendations at the societal, institutional and individual levels, which can help in women empowerment and help women take up the leadership roles. Originality/value: Although a variety of reviews have been conducted focusing on different areas in higher education, there is a small number of literature review studies in the field of women leaders in higher education, especially in Vietnam and Asia. Hence, the current study will add this missing part to the growing body of literature in WLHE."
"Design and demonstration of an islanded hybrid microgrid for an enormous motel with the appropriate solicitation of superfluous energy by using iHOGA and matlab Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems The urge for Electrical Power is escalating regularly at an increased rate due to the internationalization and progression of civilization. However, proper economic consumption of additional energy produced from the Islanded Hybrid Microgrid System (IHMS) that has not been consumed by the load is a major challenge globally. To overcome the above mentioned summon, this research focuses on a multi-optimal combination of stand-alone IHMS for Tioman Motel located at Tioman Island, Malaysia with an efficient exertion of redundant energy. To avail of this excess energy efficiently, an electrical heater along with a storage tank has been designed concerning diversion load having proper energy management. Furthermore, the system design has adopted the improved hybrid optimization by genetic algorithms (IHOGA) software for profitable and practical analysis of the designated configuration. Moreover, the optimal size of every module has been tested and analyzed through MATLAB Simulink and stabilized the whole system by representing the values of 1297 and 15 096 kW have been determined as the approximated peak and average load per day for the Motel, respectively. Moreover, the optimized IHMS is comprehended of Photovoltaic (PV) cells, Diesel Generator, Wind Turbine, Battery, and Converter. Adjacent to this, the optimized system ensued in having a net present cost (NPC) of $19.77 million, Renewable Fraction (RF) of 23%, cost of energy (COE) of $0.175/kWh, CO2 of 1 726 825 kg/year and excess energy of 532.26MWh per annum. Whereas, the system involved with the diesel generator lead a COE of $0.315/kWh, CO2 of 6 213 353 kg/year and NPC of $22.12 million. Additionally, this design alone with diesel generator has a higher CO2 emission rate, COE and NPC compared to optimized IHMS. On the other hand, the amount of excess energy is effectively utilized with an electrical heater as a diversion load."
"How do banks price liquidity? The role of market power. Interest Margin; Bank Profitability; Banking We empirically examine the effects of different measures of liquidity on interest margins of a sample of U.S. commercial banks from 2001 to 2018. Overall, the results reveal that liquidity ratios exert a positive influence on bank margins. Furthermore, the study investigates the role of market power in the relationship between liquidity and interest margins. It is documented that dominant banks incorporate the costs associated with investing in liquidity into the bank margins to a lesser extent than banks with less market power, suggesting that the cost of complying with regulatory liquidity standards is reduced when the competition in the banking sector is less intense. The study highlights that market competition might be important in the design and implementation of liquidity regulations."
"Readiness for contingency: punctuation, poise, and co-design Participatory Design; Co-Design; Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) How do we ready ourselves to intervene responsively in the contingent situations that arise in co-designing to make change? How do we attune to group dynamics and respond ethically to unpredictable developments when working with â€˜communityâ€™? This paper challenges co-design conventions that focus too tightly on formal process by addressing what happens at the moment when we step into situations to alter them with others. This is intrinsically relational and we expose the politics of practice that cannot be replicated or interchanged. Instead, we suggest that practices of readying are constituted by personal histories, experiences, philosophies, and cultures and demonstrate this by giving reflexive accounts of our dimensions of preparation. We have organised these accounts around the qualities of punctuation and poise as a way to draw out some less easily articulated aspects of co-design practice. These narratives are distinct, yet reveal complementary theories and worldviews that shape ontologies and, in turn, shape the experienceâ€“and politicsâ€“of collaboration."
"Ginsenosides act as positive modulators of P2X4 receptors Adenosine Triphosphate; Spinal Ganglia; Ligand-Gated Ion Channels We investigated the selectivity of protopanaxadiol ginsenosides from Panax ginseng acting as positive allosteric modulators on P2X receptors. ATP-induced responses were measured in stable cell lines overexpressing human P2X4 using a YOPRO-1 dye uptake assay, intracellular calcium measurements, and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Ginsenosides CK and Rd were demonstrated to enhance ATP responses at P2X4 by âˆ¼twofold, similar to potentiation by the known positive modulator ivermectin. Investigations into the role of P2X4 in mediating a cytotoxic effect showed that only P2X7 expression in HEK-293 cells induces cell death in response to high concentrations of ATP, and that ginsenosides can enhance this process. Generation of a P2X7-deficient clone of BV-2 microglial cells using CRISPR/ Cas9 gene editing enabled an investigation of endogenous P2X4 in a microglial cell line. Compared with parental BV-2 cells, P2X7-deficient BV-2 cells showed minor potentiation of ATP responses by ginsenosides, and insensitivity to ATP 2 or ATP 1 ginsenoside-induced cell death, indicating a primary role for P2X7 receptors in both of these effects. Computational docking to a homology model of human P2X4, based on the open state of zfP2X4, yielded evidence of a putative ginsenoside binding site in P2X4 in the central vestibule region of the large ectodomain."
"Domestic and International Drivers of the Demand for Water Resources in the Context of Water Scarcity: A Cross-Country Study Water Demand; Family Characteristic; End Use Global warming, while increasing human demand for water, is reducing water availability by reducing runoff flows and the effective amount of water between seasons, making water scarcity a growing problem globally. Water management plays an important role in mitigating global warming, improving the water cycle, reducing carbon emissions, and providing clean energy, and pricing water is considered a good approach to water management. Pricing water needs to take into account all sectors and aspects of society, such as domestic water, food and agriculture, energy, transport, industry, urban provision, human health, ecosystems, and the environment, and their interrelationships through water, within the context of the fundamental human rights to water and sanitation. This requires that every stakeholder should contribute to the development of water-related policies at every stage of the water interrelationship. This study investigated the relationship between water demand across different sectors of the economy using indicators for China, Australia, Japan, and the UK. Using panel analyses, this study finds that economic growth and population expansion increases the demand for water in all aspects. These findings have significant policy implications for water management. Because water prices can have an impact on global trade and, more importantly, are a major solution to global warming, water management policies should be considered at the global level, not only at the national level."
"Mega transportation infrastructure: A sustainable foresight Army; Intelligent Transportation Systems; Transportation Infrastructure The main aim of this paper is to closely investigate some of the more concerning sustainable prudence of the mega transportation Infrastructure. Mega transportation Infrastructures are projects which not only include considerable cost and time, but also significant technical complexities. Since the scope of these projects is considerable, many unknown design considerations, including sustainable implications affect their outcome. These design challenges in-turn confront the existing sustainable knowledge. Such sustainable knowledge needs to not only include the provisions of sound environmental, economic and social implications, but also the technical specification. Nonetheless, it is these four key sustainable foresight that would thus provide a holistic approach for mega transportation Infrastructure. Subsequently, such a holistic approach could be refined as Infrastructure Performance Enhancement (IPE). Accordingly, this paper will discuss some of the IPE factors and their complex trends specifically for the mega transportation Infrastructure. To further add illumination to such outcomes the Sydney Metro will be utilized as a case study."
"Lived experience, research leadership, and the transformation of mental health services: Building a researcher pipeline Community-Based Participatory Research; Community Engagement; Public Health In recent years, investment in participatory research methods within mental health services research has grown. Participatory efforts are often limited in scope, however, and attention to research leadership is largely absent from discourse about stakeholder involvement in the United States. This Open Forum calls for investment in building a pipeline of researchers with significant psychiatric disabilities and intersecting lived experiences frequently studied in public sector services research, including homelessness, incarceration, comorbid health problems, structural racism, and poverty. A series of concrete steps are described that faculty and research leadership can take now."
"Electron beam powder bed fusion of copper components: a review of mechanical properties and research opportunities Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) The purpose of this work is to identify the principle of electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) and the performance of this AM method in the processing of copper components. This review details the experimentally reported properties, including microstructural, mechanical and physical properties of pure copper made by EB-PBF. The technical challenges and opportunities of EB-PBF are identified to provide insight into the influence of process parameters on observed mechanical properties as well as a roadmap for strategic research opportunities in this field. These insights allow optimisation of EB-PBF parameters, as well as comparison of the relative merits of EB-PBF over LB-PBF in the processing of copper components. This review details the microstructure and mechanical properties of EB-PBF of copper and identifies the technical opportunities and challenges. In addition, this report characterises the influence of process parameters, and subsequent energy density, on the associated mechanical properties. The discussions showed that the chance of pollution in copper processing by EB-PBF is less than laser-based powder bed fusion (LB-PBF) due to the high vacuum environment for electron beam. Oxygen content in the EB-PBF of copper powder is a vital factor and significantly affects the mechanical properties and quality of the specimen including physical density. The produced Cu2O due to the existence of oxygen content (in powder and bulk material) can improve the mechanical properties. However, if the Cu2O exceeds a certain percentage (0.0235%wt), cracks appear and negatively affect the mechanical properties. In copper printing by this method, the process parameters have to be tuned in such a way as to generate low build temperatures due to the high thermal conductivity of this alloy and the high sintering tendency of the powder."
"The Role of Government in a Partial Transition from Public to Private in the Expanding Australian Protected Area System Payments For Ecosystem Services; Payment; China Since the 1980s in democratic societies, neoliberal reforms and neofeudal governance have transferred the delivery of many public goods and services from governments to non-government actors. Privatisation is a core neoliberal agenda, but little is known of the nature and extent of its application to nature conservation through reservation. We investigate the degree of privatisation of the expanding protected area system in our case study areas of Australia and Tasmania, hypothesising that governments have: disrupted public agencies managing the protected area estate by repeated reorganisation; diverted public funds from public to private protected areas; and increasingly alienated public reserves for subsidised private profit from tourism. We found frequent restructuring of agencies managing protected areas. Although Federal Government expenditure on private reserves increased markedly in the twenty-first century, so did expenditure on public conservation reserves. All States except Queensland increased public protected area funding. Direct subsidisation of private reserves by government has not had a steady upward trajectory. In contrast, subsidisation of private alienation of public conservation reserves for tourism may have accelerated in the twenty-first century. We conclude that, while Australian governments see value in protected areas as a source of economic development and electoral advantage, they are agnostic on ownership."
"Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis of enargite (Cu3AsS4) dissolution mechanism in sulfuric acid solution Copper; Chalcopyrite; Acidithiobacillus Ferrooxidans Enargite (Cu3AsS4) is a valuable but arsenic bearing copper resource, which is associated with common copper sulfides. The dissolution mechanism of enargite electrodes in 0.1 mol/L sulfuric acid, at room temperature was investigated by electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis methods. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott-Schottky methods were applied to systematically investigate the electrochemical dissolution of enargite. Spectroscopic analysis methods including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with cold stage, Raman spectroscopy and Synchrotron X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy were used to analyze the product layers on the electrode surface after electrochemical dissolution. The enargite electrode demonstrated an apparent passive potential region from 450 to 750 mV (Ag/AgCl. sat). Results of XPS and Raman suggested an As-sulfide surface lay of As(1-y-z)S4 was formed on the electrode surface, which accounted for the decrease in current density in the passive potential region. A trans-passive region with a small potential window between 750 mV and 900 mV was observed which might be related to the partial dissolution of the passive surface film. It is demonstrated that the trans-passive dissolution of enargite might be linked to the oxidation of sulfur, from the sulfide or polysulfide in the passive film to elemental sulfur. Moreover, copper was found to be more preferentially dissolved than arsenic in the passive and trans-passive regions. At the active dissolution region above 900 mV, the previously formed passive film got completely dissolved accompanying with the oxidation of enargite surface to produce elemental sulfur, which has been confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and sulfur K-edge XANES spectroscopy."
"Rare earth elements (REE) for the removal and recovery of phosphorus: A review Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption There is little doubt that â€˜rock phosphateâ€™ reserves are decreasing, with phosphorus (P) peak to be reached in the coming decades. Hence, removal and recovery of phosphorus (P) from alternative nutrient-rich waste streams is critical and of great importance owing to its essential role in agricultural productivity. Adsorption technique is efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable for P recovery from waste streams which otherwise can cause eutrophication in receiving waters. As selective P sorption using rare earth elements (REE) are gaining considerable attention, this review extensively focuses on P recovery by utilising a range of REE-incorporated adsorbents. The review briefly provides existing knowledge of P in various waste streams, and examines the chemistry and behaviour of REE in soil and water in detail. The impact of interfering ions on P removal using REE, adsorbent regeneration for reuse, and life cycle assessment of REE are further explored. While it is clear that REE-sorbents have excellent potential to recover P from wastewaters and to be used as fertilisers, there are gaps to be addressed. Future studies should target recovery and reuse of REE as P fertilisers using real wastewaters. More field trials of synthesized REE-sorbents are highly recommended before practical application."
"Learning analytics techniques and visualisation with textual data for determining causes of academic failure Moodle; Learning Management System; Dashboards The primary goal of higher education institutions is to support all students in the pursuit of academic success, which requires timely assistance for â€˜at riskâ€™ students. The adoption of learning management systems results in a large amount of data that can be collected, processed and utilised to improve the studentsâ€™ learning experiences. This research examines the potential applications of analytics techniques for extracting insights from student-generated content in an academic setting. It showcases how different text analytics techniques, from descriptive content analysis, semantic network analysis, to topic modelling support the discovery of new insights from unstructured, user-generated data. We looked at 968 letters written by â€˜at riskâ€™ students in an Australian-based university in Southeast Asia to examine the difficulties the students faced, which led to their academic failure. The results show that time management, family, learning, assessment, and subjects were the leading causes of poor performance, but in a more nuanced way than was expected. Students often faced multiple challenges, one led to another, which resulted in the failing grades. Our study contributes a set of effective text analytics techniques for extracting insights from student data, providing the preliminary guidelines for an information system to detect early at risk students."
"Transnational crime and its trends in South-East Asia: A detailed narrative in Vietnam Human Trafficking; Sexual Exploitation; Prostitution While implementing economic and political reforms to develop society and the economy since 1986, Vietnam has faced serious challenges to national security and social order associated with the complexities of transnational crimes (e.g., illegal drugs, human trafficking, green crimes and high-tech crimes). Additionally, as an uncharted territory in the field of criminology and policing, overall assessment of these crimes in Vietnam is still absent. Lack of knowledge and background on transnational crimes in Vietnam is considered one of the barriers to full understanding of the nature of cross-border criminals in comparison to other South-East Asian countries. This study analyses specific characteristics and modus operandi of transnational crimes in Vietnam by examining these particularly severe crimes. Findings show there are sophisticated cunning associated with flexible activities to avoid law enforcement monitors. Findings call for further research to inform policymakers and scholars."
"A commercial treatment planning system with a hybrid dose calculation algorithm for synchrotron radiotherapy trials Dosimetry; Hypofractionated Radiotherapy; Synchrotron Radiation Synchrotron Radiotherapy (SyncRT) is a preclinical radiation treatment which delivers synchrotron X-rays to cancer targets. SyncRT allows for novel treatments such as Microbeam Radiotherapy, which has been shown to have exceptional healthy tissue sparing capabilities while maintaining good tumour control. Veterinary trials in SyncRT are anticipated to take place in the near future at the Australian Synchrotron's Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL). However, before veterinary trials can commence, a computerised treatment planning system (TPS) is required, which can quickly and accurately calculate the synchrotron X-ray dose through patient CT images. Furthermore, SyncRT TPS's must be familiar and intuitive to radiotherapy planners in order to alleviate necessary training and reduce user error. We have paired an accurate and fast Monte Carlo (MC) based SyncRT dose calculation algorithm with EclipseTM, the most widely implemented commercial TPS in the clinic. Using EclipseTM, we have performed preliminary SyncRT trials on dog cadavers at the IMBL, and verified calculated doses against dosimetric measurement to within 5% for heterogeneous tissue-equivalent phantoms. We have also performed a validation of the TPS against a full MC simulation for constructed heterogeneous phantoms in EclipseTM, and showed good agreement for a range of water-like tissues to within 5%-8%. Our custom EclipseTM TPS for SyncRT is ready to perform live veterinary trials at the IMBL."
"To the letter vs the spirit: A case analysis of contrasting environmental management responses Sustainability; Environmental Management Systems; Eco-Management and Audit Scheme Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine why firms governed by the same environmental management standards within an industry exhibit contrasting responses, with some adhering to the letter and others achieving the spirit behind the standards. Design/methodology/approach: Using Arena et al. (2010) as an analytical schema to examine the institutional dynamics behind such contrasting responses, the paper analyses archival and interview data relating to firm strategy, control technology and human expertise in two contrasting Australian forestry firms. Findings: The embedding and decoupling of environmental standards with a firmâ€™s environmental management practices is influenced, first, by the extent to which founder directors and senior management integrate environmental responsibility with the underlying business motives and, second, by the use of organisational beliefs and values systems to institutionalise the integrated strategic rationality throughout the firm. Finally, informed by the institutionalised strategic rationality, the participation and expertise of actors across the organisational hierarchy determine the level to which the design and execution of the eco-control technologies move beyond merely monitoring compliance, and act to facilitate continuous improvement, knowledge integration and organisational learning at the operational level. Originality/value: This paper responds to institutional theoristsâ€™ call for a holistic explanation that considers the interactions among several intra-organisational factors to explain the dynamics behind why some firms decouple while others do not, even though the firms exist in the same social and regulatory context."
"The Contested Politics of Drought, Water Security and Climate Adaptation in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Droughts are intensifying in many mid-latitude river basins due to climate change; therefore understanding the influence of droughts on water policy is crucial. This study of the politics of water reforms in Australiaâ€™s Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) analyses contrasting discourses of water security during the Millennium Drought (1996-2010). The paper traces the historical evolution, mobilisation and effects of three discourses defined as 'drought-proofing', 'higher value use' and 'river restoration'. These are broadly aligned with engineering, economics and ecological perspectives, and while all discourses were integrated into government responses to the drought, the resurgence of drought-proofing significantly altered policy settings intended to shift MDB water management onto a more sustainable path. The paper illustrates the political and physical conditioning of water policy, placing drought responses in their historical context. The analysis demonstrates how policy actors used discourses of water security to define normative goals and legitimise policies, particularly when climatic extremes provide opportunities to influence policy outcomes. The paper provides three key insights for water governance and climate adaptation: first, drought responses can have far-reaching effects for water governance and policy trajectories; second, droughts pose challenges to positive climate adaptation when they revitalise heroic drought-proofing initiatives; and third, understanding the historical roots of contemporary drought responses is vital for effective climate adaptation"
"Impact of microalgae species and solution salinity on algal treatment of wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Six common microalgal species, including freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus abundans, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Coelastrum microporum, and marine microalgae Nannochloropsis salina and Dunaliella tertiolecta, were tested in batch treatment to identify the most promising species for remediating a municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC). Selected species were then studied at different ROC salinity levels (5, 10, and 15 g TDS/L) in semi-continuous treatment to evaluate their potential for nutrient remediation, and biogas production through anaerobic digestion. S. abundans, C. vulgaris, and N. salina showed higher potential for growth and nutrient remediation under salinity stress. Further tests revealed that N. salina adapted well to ROC conditions, and S. abundans could grow better and had higher tolerance to the elevated salinity than C. vulgaris. S. abundans and N. salina performed better for removing nutrients and organic matter (11.5â€“18 mg/L/d TN, 7.1â€“8.2 mg/L/d TP, and 8.6â€“12.4 mg/L/d DOC). Increasing salinity led to growth inhibition and N uptake reduction for freshwater species but had no significant effect on TP removal. Biochemical methane potential tests showed the algal biomass produced a significant amount of methane (e.g., up to 422 mL CH4/g VS for N. salina), suggesting the algae generated from the ROC treatment could produce significant amounts of energy through anaerobic digestion without the need for pretreatment. This study showed the environmental and economic potential of the algal system for future applications."
"Environmental factors affecting the germination and seedling emergence of two populations of an emerging agricultural weed: Wild lettuce (Lactuca serriola) Seed; Germination; Weeds Wild lettuce (Lactuca serriola L.) is a significant emerging agricultural and environmental weed in many countries. This invasive species is now naturalised in Australia and is claimed to cause significant losses within the agricultural industry. Sustainable management of wild lettuce has been hampered by a lack of detailed knowledge of its seed ecology. Laboratory-based studies were performed to examine the potential influence of environmental factors including temperature and light conditions, salinity, pH, moisture availability and burial depth on the germination and emergence of two spatially distant populations of wild lettuce. Results suggested that the germination of wild lettuce seeds occurred across a broad range of temperature conditions (12-h cycle: 30Â°C/20Â°C, 25Â°C/15Â°C and 17Â°C/7Â°C) for both populations. We also found that these seeds are non-photoblastic germination was not affected by darkness, with >80% germination in darkness for both populations at all tested temperature ranges. Germination significantly declined as salinity and osmotic stress increased for both populations, with seeds from the Tempy population were more affected by NaCl >100 mM than seeds from Werribee, but in neither population was there any observed effect of pH on germination (>80% germination in both populations at all tested pH ranges). For both populations, germination significantly decreased as burial depth increased however, the two populations differed with regard to response to burial depth treatment, whereby seeds from the Tempy population had higher emergence than those from Werribee at 0.5 cm burial depth. These results suggest that light-reducing management techniques such as mulching or use of crop residues will be unsuccessful for preventing germination of wild lettuce. By contrast, burial of seeds at a depth of at least 4 cm will significantly reduce their emergence."
"'I didn't even know it was a thing': Australian young adults' experience of economic abuse Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Economics of Scale Economic abuse is a form of intimate partner violence that involves one partner controlling or restricting, exploiting or sabotaging the economic resources of the other partner. Little is known how economic abuse manifests in young people's relationships or how to prevent it. This study explored young adults' experiences of economic abuse and identified the factors associated with economic abuse in their relationships. Twenty-four young adults (18 women and 6 men) aged 18-29, were interviewed in-depth using both unstructured narrative and semi-structured interview questions. Thematic analysis was used to identify forms of economic abuse. Common experiences of economic abuse included: exploitation of financial and other resources, controlling access to money, damage to property and sabotage of employment and study. The contextual factors included lack of awareness of economic abuse, valuing love and relationships over money and fear of conflict and rejection. We argue that economic abuse prevention strategies should target young adults in their relationship formation stage and take into account the context of relationships and the issues young people face when venturing into cohabitation."
"Novel molecular tracers for the assessment of groundwater pollution PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs The range of synthetic chemicals produced and released into the global environment, and our understanding of their potential harm to human and ecological health are both growing. However, in many instances our understanding of these compounds and their environmental behaviour and associated risks is still lacking. To address this issue, there is a need to advance methods of contaminant detection, and a concomitant increase in understanding of their sources, fate and transport in the environment. In this context, having a range of tools allowing for the accurate and rapid identification of groundwater contaminants and understand their sources and behaviour, is vital to preventing major public and environmental health problems, and costly, difficult cleanups. This article reviews important recent advances in the use of novel molecular tracers to enhance the identification and characterisation of groundwater pollution sources, and understand how they move, accumulate and degrade in the subsurface environment."
"Width effect of interfacial bond characteristics Strengthening; Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics; Debonding The bond properties of an interface in composite structures are generally considered as local mechanical characteristics. Through experimental testing and analytical study, it is shown in this work that the interfacial bond characteristics are generally size dependent, which involve both Mode II and Mode III fractures. For fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) externally bonded (EB) to concrete members, this size effect is called the width effect. Test results in this work show that there is a central region on EB FRP-to-concrete bond face where only Mode II fracture is involved, and hence, the bond properties are size independent. The measured bond test results in the central region are used to determine interfacial bond properties that are size independent. The global test results or overall bond responses are subsequently used to determine the width effect and its model, through rational reasoning and regression of test results. The proposed model includes new factor that has not been considered in the width effect modeling, and consequently shows a better performance."
"Chinese preservice teachers engaging with children through music, their story Music Lessons; Musicianship; Spontaneity The topic addressed in this chapter is the role that adults can play in the role of developing young childrenâ€™s musical identities. Many of the adults discussed in other chapters in this book have been teachers. The teachers in Serbia using music to enhance childrenâ€™s understanding of themselves and their world, the academics who research and teach are examples. In this chapter we introduce a group of preservice teachers who were able to use their knowledge of music to relate to children when undertaking placement in early childhood services. Music, because it is an emotional communication, is an important language of childhood, a major artefact and a language that can transverse cultural settings. This shared medium made it possible for these preservice teachers, who had grown up in another language and culture able to quickly develop relationships with child through joint action. Music is a symbolic system and the signs used are accessible to the young child. Music is therefore an important communicative tool and played a significant role into mediating these preservice teachers into an unknown environment."
"A novel approach for tailoring pesticide screens for monitoring regional aquatic ecosystems Neonicotinoid Insecticides; Insecticide; Chironomus Dilutus Pesticide monitoring programs are required to understand pesticide contamination in the environment. They can be used to compare existing water quality guidelines and associated their presence with activities related to catchments. Thus, provide crucial information for management actions. A major challenge with such programs is to determine which pesticides should be screened and this determination is made more difficult as many new pesticides are continuously emerging on markets. We have developed a robust method to identify those pesticides which should be included in screens based on whether they are likely to be used within the region surveyed and if they pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems. This approach is illustrated by comparing the Warrnambool South West (WSW) and Mornington Peninsula (MP) regions within Victoria, Australia that have contrasting land-use practices. Pest control products registered and approved for land-use activities within the two regions during the past decade were identified using a government database. Those pesticides in these products which were not screened by commercial laboratories were then identified. Region-specific identification of prevalent pesticide usage was estimated by matching the highest-grossing agricultural commodities within the two regions with pesticide-specific land-uses. A total of 56 (WSW) and 54 (MP) unique pesticides and another 34 being common in both regions were identified that can be augmented to standard screens of analytical laboratories. Different pesticides of concern are likely to be identified for aquatic ecosystems in other regions of the world; as they will have different regional land-uses, laboratory screens and different pesticide use to those identified in this study. The approach presented here can assist authorities in identifying which pesticides should be incorporated into local pesticide monitoring programs."
"Unpacking the relationship between high-performance work systems and innovation performance in SMEs High Performance Work Systems; Personnel; HR Practice Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the black box between high-performance work systems (HPWS) and innovation performance in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Through application of the ability, motivation and opportunity (AMO) framework, the study examines the mediating roles of innovation-specific ability, motivation and voice behaviors between HPWS and SMEsâ€™ innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses are tested on data collected through a self-administered questionnaire from 237 SMEs in Pakistan. Findings: Findings indicate that human capital, motivation and employee voice fully mediate the relationship between HPWS and innovation performance in SMEs. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional research design and self-reported measures warrant caution for the interpretation of findings. Future research may consider a longitudinal research design and objective measures. Practical implications: SMEs need to invest in the adoption and implementation of HPWS that will develop innovation-specific abilities, motivation and voice behaviors simultaneously among employees that will lead to higher innovation performance. Originality/value: This is the first study of its kind utilizing an AMO framework to investigate the underlying mechanism through which HPWS affect innovation performance in SMEs."
"Effect of building direction on porosity and fatigue life of selective laser melted AlSi12Mg alloy Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Gas porosity is one of the most common defects in aluminum alloy parts manufactured by solidification processing, and can have a strong influence on fatigue properties. This study shows that gas pores with a fraction of 0.2â€“1.6% and an average size of 20â€“55 Âµm are present in the Al-Si alloy parts manufactured by Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Failure after fatigue testing was found to initiate from surface or subsurface gas pores and fatigue life prediction equations were developed considering the influence of pores. The building direction did not have a statistically verifiable effect on the average gas porosity fraction, size and distribution, although the scatter in porosity fraction was greater in the vertically built specimens. At the same applied stress, the fatigue life of SLM manufactured specimens decreased with an increase in pore size, and specimens built horizontally exhibited a greater fatigue life than those built vertically. The cause is attributed to greater propensity of cracks to propagate along lower strength melt pool boundary layers in vertically built specimens."
"Determinants of AIDS knowledge among construction workers AIDS/HIV; Child Mortality; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Accurate knowledge about AIDS transmission is pivotal to combating the spread of HIV infection and the risks of re-infection. Using multiple linear regression, the determinants of AIDS knowledge were investigated in a survey of 512 site-based construction workers in the Western Cape. Over a third of survey participants indicated poor levels of AIDS knowledge. Ethnicity, level of education, employment status and acquaintance with an HIV+ person were significant in predicting AIDS knowledge. Gender, age, multiple sex partners in the preceding 3 months and condom use at last sex were not found to be significant determinants of AIDS knowledge. Workplace interventions by employers, whilst focusing on all employees, should concentrate their efforts on identifying and targeting those demographic sub-populations that are at greatest risk of having poorer levels of AIDS knowledge."
"Reliability-based design of FRP flexural strengthened reinforced concrete beams: Guidelines assessment and calibration Strengthening; Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics; Debonding In the past few decades, many guidelines and standards for FRP strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) structures have been presented based on the theory of reliability-based limit state with the load and resistance factor design (LRFD) approach. The LRFD method consists of two formats: the resistance reduction factor format and the material partial safety factor format. In this paper, several well-recognized design guidelines with these two formats for FRP flexural strengthened RC beams have been assessed based on model error and reliability index. First, the model error of each design guideline was evaluated based on a collected test database. Then, the reliability index was obtained by the importance sampling (IS) method, in which the optimum density function is determined by the first-order reliability method (FORM). Finally, the calibration of resistance reduction factor or FRP partial safety factor was performed with different target reliability indexes. The results show that: (1) The model error of each failure mode is different for each design guideline. For flexural failure, China's GB 50608 2010 has the lowest model error. For intermediate crack-induced (IC) debonding, UK's TR 55 2012 shows the highest model error. For end debonding, Italy's CNR-DT 200 R1/2012 is less conservative. (2) It is difficult to meet the pre-given reliability level for some failure modes in several design guidelines using the originally suggested design parameters. For example, GB 50608 2010, fib T5.1 2019 and JSCE 2001. (3) The calibrated resistance reduction factors or the FRP partial safety factors are provided to satisfy the target reliability level. However, it is meaningless and uneconomical to adopt partial safety factors that are too large or reduction factors that are too small to fit into a design. Other options can be chosen such as applying additional anchorages to avoid end debonding, increasing the FRP bonding area, and reducing the FRP thickness to avoid the probability of IC debonding failure."
"Improving the resilience of critical infrastructures: Evidence-based insights from a systematic literature review Cascading Failure; Giant Component; Robustness Critical Infrastructures (CIs) have become the backbone of the economy and functionality of the built environment among all nations. The absence of a universally accepted definition for CIs hinders one's attempts at building the resilience of CIs against disasters. Identification of damage reduction measures is vital in decision-making to achieve the required disaster resilience in following established frameworks. Target D of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) mainly emphasises the substantial reduction of disaster damages to the CIs through improving resilience within them. This study aims to develop a set of measures for achieving SFDRR target D using a systematic literature review. This study aims to identify a universal definition of CIs through critical indicators and propose optimum measures for enhancing the resilience of CIs. Twelve indicators are proposed under three aspects (resilience, environmental and sustainability, and socio-economic) to identify the CIs. Furthermore, eight measures were identified to achieve SFDRR target D. The identified measures were applied using CI examples to demonstrate that outcomes can be applied to enhance the existing governance systems of CIs."
"A Novel Acoustomicrofluidic Nebulization Technique Yielding New Crystallization Morphologies Supercritical Fluids; Nanocrystal; Povidone A novel acoustic microfluidic nebulization platform is demonstrated, which, due to its unique ability to access intermediate evaporation rate regimesâ€”significantly faster than that in slow solvent evaporation but considerably below that achieved in spray drying, is capable of producing novel crystal morphologies that have yet to be reported in both model inorganic and organic systems. In addition, the potential for simultaneously encapsulating single crystals within a biodegradable polymeric coating in a single simultaneous step together with the crystallization process as the solvent evaporates during nebulization is briefly shown. The platform not only has the potential to be highly scalable by employing a large number of these low-cost miniature devices in parallel to achieve industrially relevant particle production rates, but could also be advantageous over conventional spray drying in terms of energy utilization, given the tremendous efficiency associated with the high-frequency ultrasonic microdevice as well as its ambient temperature operation."
"Institutionalising multiple accountability logics in public services: Insights from Australia Accrual Accounting; International Public Sector Accounting Standards; Local Government This paper reports on a field study of how a range of inter-institutional and inter-organisational forces shape the evolving rhetoric and practice of multiple accountabilities in public services. Drawing on the institutional logics perspective, we carried out a qualitative field study in the Australian Commonwealth Public Service involving semi-structured interviews, two focus group discussions, and the examination of internal accounting, management reports, and government archival records. The findings suggest that emphasis on conventional instrumental mechanisms and reporting tools, such as budgeting and accrual-based reporting, support managerial (instrumental) accountability through compliance logics. We conclude that an emphasis on public (relational) accountability through public dialogue is central to the public sector accountability debate, and that more attention needs to be paid to the question of how to balance the dual logics (instrumental and relational) in public services. The findings provide practical insights for public sector managers, policymakers and governments responsible for designing and implementing reforms, accounting tools, and accountability practices."
"Community-diversified influence maximization in social networks Service Recommendation; Computation Offloading; Edge Computing To meet the requirement of social influence analytics in various applications, the problem of influence maximization has been studied in recent years. The aim is to find a limited number of nodes (i.e., users) which can activate (i.e. influence) the maximum number of nodes in social networks. However, the community diversity of influenced users is largely ignored even though it has unique value in practice. For example, the higher community diversity reduces the risk of marketing campaigns as you should not put all your eggs in one basket; the diversity can also prolong the effect of a marketing campaign in the future promotion. Motivated by this observation, this paper investigates Community-diversified Influence Maximization (CDIM) problem to efficiently find k nodes such that, if a message is initiated and spread by the k nodes, the number as well as the community diversity of the activated nodes will be maximized at the end of propagation process. This work proposes a metric to measure the community-diversified influence and addresses a series of computational challenges. Two algorithms and an innovative CPSP-Tree index have been developed. This study also investigates the situation that community definition is not specified. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions have been verified through extensive experimental studies on five real-world social network datasets."
"Listening circles provide model for students in disrupted journalism industry Service Learning; Community Engagement; Education Journalism internships are acknowledged by Australian educators (Bowman L, Lund A: Pathways to the profession: a study in integrating journalism degree programs with the world of work. In: ATN evaluation and assessment conference 2007: Assessment and evaluation for real work learning, Queensland University of Technology, 2007; Forde S, Meadows M: JRE J (4):1-26, 2011; McHugh PP: J Educ Work 30(4):367-382, 2017) as being a vital adjunct to journalism training. Internships not only build the practical skills that journalists will need in the workplace but allow them to meet the people in the industry who can later recommend them or to alert them to opportunities and opportunities. Internships can also provide important transformative learning opportunities for students triggering a shift in the way they view and exist in the world (Oâ€™Sullivan E, Morrell A, Oâ€™Connor MA: Expanding the boundaries of transformative learning: essays on theory and praxis. Palgrave, New York, 2002). Massive changes to the journalism industry caused by funding issues and digital disruption have left students often interning in newsrooms with seriously stressed staff and often clouds of redundancies hanging over them. These issues, on top of the normal stresses of trauma and journalistic work that are part of industry, required a new method of support for the students. This chapter reports on a pilot of the listening circles offered to undergraduate and postgraduate journalism students. It draws on thematic analysis of the discussions and surveys of students conducted during their compulsory work placements. It outlines the benefits reported by the students of coming together in circles to listen and reflect upon their experiences and the experiences of their peers while still doing internships. It notes the circles were envisaged as a continuous cycle of supportive practice that was neither a mandated part of the curriculum nor part of the assessment process. By building listening circles into the curriculum, it is argued that students will be better supported during the disruption to the industry, but also learn reflective skills which could be later used upon their graduation and future employment."
"Surface topology modification of organic substrates using material jetting technologies Riblets; Drag Reduction; Turbulence The ability to directly modify the topology of a surface with three-dimensional micron-scale features provides both a mechanism of controlling how it interacts with the surrounding environment and the potential to impart functional features. Using direct material jetting based additive manufacturing technologies, we report the direct printing of microstructures onto aluminium coupons previously finished with polyurethane (PU) coatings where the overcoat window proved crucial for this process. The effect of PU coating's age on the development of strong interfacial interactions and hence the level of adhesion achieved between the photopolymer and the topcoat was explored. With aging, the PU coatings were shown to increase in cross-link density which resulted in reduced levels of adhesion with the photopolymer observed. This was reflected in changes in surface energy hence surface chemistry via XPS analysis. Changes in the interfacial interactions were qualitatively examined through SEM analysis of the photopolymer â€“ PU coating interface which showed localized debonding (de-wetting) of the photopolymer when printing was performed on aged PU topcoats."
"Domestic and International Drivers of the Demand for Water Resources in the Context of Water Scarcity: A Cross-Country Study Water Demand; Family Characteristic; End Use Global warming, while increasing human demand for water, is reducing water availability by reducing runoff flows and the effective amount of water between seasons, making water scarcity a growing problem globally. Water management plays an important role in mitigating global warming, improving the water cycle, reducing carbon emissions, and providing clean energy, and pricing water is considered a good approach to water management. Pricing water needs to take into account all sectors and aspects of society, such as domestic water, food and agriculture, energy, transport, industry, urban provision, human health, ecosystems, and the environment, and their interrelationships through water, within the context of the fundamental human rights to water and sanitation. This requires that every stakeholder should contribute to the development of water-related policies at every stage of the water interrelationship. This study investigated the relationship between water demand across different sectors of the economy using indicators for China, Australia, Japan, and the UK. Using panel analyses, this study finds that economic growth and population expansion increases the demand for water in all aspects. These findings have significant policy implications for water management. Because water prices can have an impact on global trade and, more importantly, are a major solution to global warming, water management policies should be considered at the global level, not only at the national level."
"Fire frequency analysis for different climatic stations in Victoria, Australia Flood Frequency; L-Moment; Catchment Area (Hydrology) Frequent occurrence of fire events will have severe impact on Victoriaâ€™s water supply catchments. Hence, it is important to perform fire frequency analysis to obtain fire frequency curves (FFC) on fire intensity using Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) at different parts of Victoria. FFDI is a measure of fire initiation, spreading speed and containment difficulty. FFC will guide water harvesting by providing information with regard to future fire events and the subsequent impact on catchment yield. Five probability distributions, namely normal, Log Pearson Type III (LPIII), gamma, log-normal and Weibull distributions were used for the development of FFCs at ten selected meteorological stations spread all over Victoria. LPIII distribution was identified as the best fit distribution for Victoria and subsequently applied for an additional 30 more stations to show spatial variability for the entire Victoria."
"Carbon dioxide reforming of methane over mesoporous alumina supported Ni(Co), Ni(Rh) bimetallic, and Ni(CORh) trimetallic catalysts: Role of nanoalloying in improving the stability and nature of coking Catalyst; Steam Reforming; Synthesis Gas Catalytic dry reforming of methane using carbon dioxide (DRM) to produce CO rich syngas (synthesis gas) over supported nickel catalysts presents major challenges including the carbon deposition and active metal sintering at high operating temperatures. In this work, we have demonstrated that addition of rhodium and cobalt to the nickel phase supported on mesoporous alumina (MAl) to form bimetallic and tri metallic RhNi/MAl, NiCo/MAl, and NiCoRh/MAl catalysts and alloying of Ni was found to enhance the catalyst activity and high resistance toward coking. All these catalysts were synthesized using a triblock copolymer P123 templated precipitation of aluminum isopropoxide and metal precursors, followed by the removal of the template by calcination. The high conversions of CH4 with CO2 into syngas and the nature of carbon formation on these bimetallic catalysts were found to be different from those of the monometallic catalysts, and the ratios of H2 and CO in the syngas were observed to be 0.9âˆ’1. The enhanced stability and activity were attributed to the bimetallic phase formation, which was supported by XRD, XPS, TPR, TGA, TEM, and N2-sorption analysis of the fresh and spent catalysts. From these results, a plausible mechanism was proposed to explain the enhanced catalytic activity and stability, which was mainly due to the nature of alloy formation. Nickel was found to form a homogeneous alloy phase with cobalt, while it formed a heterogeneous bimetallic phase with rhodium. Alloying with cobalt moderates the coking in the NiCo/MAl case, while alloying with rhodium increases the carbon gasification by hydrogen spillover effect in the case of NiRh/MAl."
"Traditionalism vs egalitarianism: Is there an association between gender attitudes and mental health? Child Care; Time Use; Domestic Division of Labour Objective: This study sought to assess the extent to which gender attitudes are associated with mental health among Australian men and women. Methods: This study used a sample of 26,188 individuals drawn from five waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. Gender attitudes were classified into three groups (traditional, moderate-egalitarian and egalitarian), and were constructed from six items. Mental health was measured using the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). We calculated the magnitude of associations between gender attitudes and mental health, stratified by gender, and adjusted for potential confounding. Results: Compared to men with egalitarian attitudes, poorer mental health was observed among men with moderate-egalitarian (âˆ’1.16, 95% confidence interval = [âˆ’1.84, âˆ’0.49]) and traditional gender attitudes (âˆ’2.57, 95% confidence interval = [âˆ’3.33, âˆ’1.81]). Among women, poorer mental health was observed among those with moderate-egalitarian (âˆ’0.78, 95% confidence interval = [âˆ’1.34, âˆ’0.22]) and traditional attitudes (âˆ’1.91, 95% confidence interval = [âˆ’2.55, âˆ’1.26]) compared to those with egalitarian attitudes. Conclusions: For both men and women, egalitarian gender attitudes were associated with better mental health."
"Direct conversion of CO2to solid carbon by Ga-based liquid metals Carbon Dioxide; Electrocatalysts; Chemical Reduction The direct conversion of CO2 to carbon is a highly providential route; however, conventional thermal and catalytic approaches are hindered by high energy demands and are limited by coking. Here, we report a robust and highly selective method for the direct conversion of CO2 to solid carbon over EGaIn liquid metal (LM) alloy. We utilized the low-melting point of this alloy to facilitate the reduction of CO2 at low temperatures, producing 319 Î¼mol h-1 of carbon at 200 Â°C, and remarkably enabling CO2 activation and carbon production even at room temperature, without the use of a supplementary reductant such as hydrogen. The deployed LM showed no signs of deactivation by coking and the generated carbon is shown to naturally accumulate at the top of the LM where it can be easily collected. In situ XPS measurements indicate an increase of 9.6% in the carbon-carbon bond content and an equivalent decrease in the Ga metal content, upon exposure of the LM to CO2 for 30 mins at 200 Â°C and 1 bar. This led to the conclusion that solid carbon and gallium oxide are the final reaction products of this process. Density functional theory calculations shed further light on the adsorption and dissociation of CO2 over Ga and EGaIn. The presented method creates a pathway to transforming CO2 to perpetually stored solid carbon and can therefore set a trajectory for making a measurable impact on carbon intensive industries."
"Proteo-Molecular Investigation of Cultivated Rice, Wild Rice, and Barley Provides Clues of Defense Responses against Rhizoctonia solani Infection Leaf Blight; Thanatephorus Cucumeris; Quantitative Trait Loci Rhizoctonia solani is a soil-borne fungus causing sheath blight disease in cereal crops including rice. Genetic resistance to sheath blight disease in cereal crops is not well understood in most of the host(s). Aside from this, a comparative study on the different hosts at the biochemical and proteomic level upon R. solani infection was not reported earlier. Here, we performed proteomic based analysis and studied defense pathways among cultivated rice (cv. Pusa Basmati-1), wild rice accession (Oryza grandiglumis), and barley (cv. NDB-1445) after inoculation with R. solani. Increased levels of phenol, peroxidase, and Î²-1, 3-glucanase were observed in infected tissue as compared to the control in all of the hosts. Wild rice accession O. grandiglumis showed a higher level of biochemical signals than barley cv. NDB 1445 and cultivated rice cv. Pusa Basmati-1. Using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and mass spectrometry (MS), differently expressed proteins were also studied in control and after inoculation with R. solani. Wild rice accession O. grandiglumis induced a cysteine protease inhibitor and zinc finger proteins, which have defense functions and resistance against fungal pathogens. On the other hand, barley cv. NDB-1445 and cultivated rice cv. Pusa Basmati-1 mainly induce energy metabolism-related proteins/signals after inoculation with R. solani in comparison to wild rice accession O. grandiglumis. The present comprehensive study of R. solani interaction using three hosts, namely, Pusa Basmati-1 (cultivated rice), O. grandiglumis (wild rice), and NDB-1445 (barley) would interpret wider possibilities in the dissection of the protein(s) induced during the infection process. These proteins may further be correlated to the gene(s) and other related molecular tools that will help for the marker-assisted breeding and/or gene editing for this distressing disease among the major cereal crops."
"Australia-Japan QZSS emergency warning service trial project Warning Systems; Emergencies; Disasters This paper provides an overview and the results of the Australia-Japan 2020 Quasi Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) Emergency Warning System trial project. The project aimed to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of utilising the QZSS system to support emergency warning and response in Australia. The trial has focussed on bushfire and tsunami warnings with an emphasis on the message structure and standards for incorporation on the available signal bandwidth, and the spatial coverage extent of the messages. It also aimed to address the need for a space-based communication capability in Australia, which could potentially facilitate effective emergency warning system unconstrained by the limitations of terrestrial telecommunications. A newly dedicated MobileApp was developed to decode the warning message and visualise relevant information on a map. Two messages for bushfire and tsunami warnings were generated in Australia and sent to the QZSS ground station for satellite transmission. The developed application was tested in Victoria and New South Wales. The trial was successful in the sense that the emergency warning message could be received and decoded using the QZSS enabled receivers and the dedicated MobileApp. The field tests showed that the systems are capable of delivering the required information to users with the required timeliness and completeness. Several technical issues encountered during testing can be primarily attributed to the alpha state of the app, and the specific receiver used for testing. Neither of which are considered to be significant barriers to the on-going development of an operational satellite EWS system."
"The influence of school and family education towards a professional career: the case of the wine industry in two emerging economies Socioemotional Wealth; Family Firms; Innovation This study examines the role of school and family education in supporting individualsâ€™ career path, specifically in the wine and wine tourism environments. To gain a more in-depth understanding of this dimension, key underpinnings of social learning and family social capital theory are considered. Owners and managers of 32 wineries from two emerging economies participated through face-to-face interviews. While there was general agreement regarding the significance of school education, the relevance of family education was perceived more strongly, including in instilling effort, values and codes of conduct, thus, influencing participantsâ€™ journey towards a managerial or ownership role in the wine industry. Assimilating earlier stages of oneâ€™s life, vicarious learning, self-efficacy, and family social capital were manifested through intrinsic principles, and were further enhanced through learning gained via work experience and continuous knowledge gathering. A model highlighting links between the empirical findings and the above theoretical underpinnings is proposed."
"Rheological measurements as indicators for hydrolysis rate, organic matter removal, and dewaterability of digestate in anaerobic digesters Sewage; Total Solids; Activated Sludge The relationship between rheological properties and the hydrolysis rate in anaerobic digestion (AD) is poorly understood. This study investigated AD of waste-activated sludge (WAS) in batch digesters of 2.10%, 3.40%, 4.10%, and 5.02%TS digester media (WAS mixed with inoculum). The digesters operated below ammonia inhibition levels and at the same food to inoculum (F/I) ratios, temperature, and mixing. The results indicated that a decrease in the hydrolysis rate was associated with an increase in yield stress, the flow consistency index, and viscoelastic moduli. In addition, the statistical analysis revealed the linear relationships between changes in the flow consistency index and hydrolysis rate as well as the efficiency of organic matter removal, regardless of the types and origin of sludge, the F/I ratio, and the seasons when sampling occurred. A linear relationship between yield stress and dewaterability was also revealed. These findings indicate that the flow consistency index measurement could be a reliable method for monitoring the hydrolysis stage and organic matter removal in anaerobic digesters."
"Potential for sustainable utilisation of agricultural residues for bioenergy production in Pakistan: An overview Pakistan; Renewable Energy Policy; Fossil Fuel Pakistan's current energy portfolio is problematic due to a lack of proper management and implementation of appropriate energy policies. This densely populated country has a high energy demand that rises yearly and is expected to increase three-fold by 2050. However, fossil fuel resources are continuously depleting by global overuse while negatively impacting the environment through increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This study reviewed the potential for agricultural residues to be used as renewable energy sources for bioenergy production in Pakistan to address the energy-related challenges that would also help in addressing the economic and environmental concerns. First, a comparison was made between the current energy situation, potential renewable energy scenarios, and global trends. Second, greenhouse gas (i.e., CO2) emissions in Pakistan were summarised and compared with other regions. Third, the thermochemical properties of different agricultural residues were reviewed along with varying the options of processing to produce renewable energy such as thermochemical conversion approaches (combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and liquefaction) and biochemical conversion options (anaerobic digestion, and fermentation). Pakistan being an agricultural-based economy, produces vast quantities of agricultural residue biomass, which is mostly underutilized as animal feed, conventional fuel substitutes, left to rot in fields or burnt to get rid, resulting in the vast emissions of greenhouse gases causing severe environmental pollution and smog formation. A considerable share of Pakistan's national energy demand can be fulfilled if these feedstocks are adequately managed and exploited through the energy sector and converted into large-scale bioenergy."
"Direct connection of an amine to oligothiophene to generate push-pull chromophores for organic photovoltaic applications Polymer Solar Cells; Polymers; Organic Photovoltaics Through the direct connection of the donor nitrogen atom to oligothiophenes, herein we report three novel, donor materials for evaluation in bulk-heterojunction solar cells. The direct substitution enhances the charge transfer transition, thus improving the light-harvesting ability of the target chromophores. The influence of various terminal acceptor functionalities on the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties was systematically studied. The target chromophore, T3, bearing oxoindenemalononitrile acceptor unit afforded a power conversion efficiency of 6.12% when paired with the conventional acceptor, PC61BM, a result that is the highest in the current literature for push-pull chromophores."
"Human-made corals for marine habitats: Design optimization and additive manufacturing Boron Isotopes; Coral; Coralline Alga This paper presents an optimization method to systematically design human-made corals using the technique of solid isotropic material with the penalization. In optimization, we minimized the squared norm of the carbon gradient and considered the volume constraint and the length constraint. We homogeneously dented optimization results using a surface mapping method to provide shelters for polyps, which widely exist in natural corals like the anthocyanins. A computational fluid dynamics investigation based on the lattice Boltzmann method illustrated that the branches of the optimized configuration could shield polyps from ocean currents and afford sufficient nutrition. Eventually, we prototyped samples by digital light processing printer with an optimum mixture ratio of biologically compatible calcium carbonate and photosensitive material. Examples show the tropism of marine organisms in human-made corals is akin to the natural ones. The proposed method allows designing human-made corals and is crucial for environmental remediation."
"Exploring changes in the frequency of public transport use among residents who move to outer suburban greenfield estates Built Environment; Mode Choice; Urban Form This paper explores changes in the frequency of public transport use among residents who have moved to outer suburban greenfield estates and factors that are associated with these changes. A survey of 352 residents living in two outer suburban estates in Melbourne was undertaken, along with 30 semi-structured interviews with residents in the estates. Results showed that one-third of survey respondents (33%) reported a decrease in public transport use after moving, while 21% reported an increase and almost half (46%) reported no change. A significantly poorer level of built environment and public transport service quality at the new estates was also found compared with respondentsâ€™ previous residential locations. Binary logistic regression results adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics showed that using public transport at least once a week before moving, and agreement with the statement that there is no suitable public transport near home, were strongly associated with a decrease in public transport use upon moving. The findings suggest that while public transport service quality is undoubtedly critical in facilitating public transport use in new estates, having a supportive built environment is also important, along with knowledge of future residentsâ€™ previous use of public transport and reasons for not using public transport."
"Energy, exergy, and sustainability analyses of the agricultural sector in Bangladesh Exergy; Rotary Kilns; Energy Efficiency Globally, the agriculture sector consumes a considerable portion of energy. Optimizing energy consumption and energy loss from different fuel-based types of machinery will increase the energy sustainability of this sector. Exergy analysis is a useful optimizing method that applies the thermodynamic approach to minimize energy loss. The main goal of this study is to highlight the impact of exergy loss on the energy sustainability of the agriculture sector. Hence, this study focuses on the implementation of exergy-based sustainability parameters to determine the sustainability of the agricultural sector in Bangladesh. A comprehensive analysis combining energy, exergy, and sustainability indicators was conducted based on the data obtained from 1990 to 2017. Overall energy and exergy efficiencies varied between 29.86% and 36.68% and 28.2% and 35.4%, respectively, whereas the sustainability index varied between 1.39 and 1.54. The values of relative irreversibility and lack of productivity indices from diesel fuel are higher than that of other fuel types. Maximum relative irreversibility is 0.95, whereas maximum lack of productivity is 2.50. The environmental effect factor of diesel fuel is the highest (2.47) among all the analyzed fuel types. Replacing old farming devices and selecting appropriate farming methods, appliances, and control systems will reduce exergy loss in this sector."
"Ethical considerations for conservation messaging research and practice Social Media; Organization-public Relationships; Strategic Communication Conservation professionals are familiar with value-driven research and practice. However, recent efforts to use strategic communication, specifically conservation messaging, to affect targeted behaviour change or influence values and attitudes towards conservation introduce new ethical dilemmas that conservation professionals may not have considered or are ill-equipped to deal with. Drawing from strategic communication theory and professional guidelines, including from public relations, social marketing, advocacy, and the social sciences more broadly, we provide a framework and discuss important ethical considerations for conservation messaging. The considerations discussed include those that apply across all stages of conservation messaging (be reflexive, engage responsibly, and consider power), as well as those that apply when defining the problem (ensure fairness in audience targeting), designing the solution (use equitable messages and calls to action and use truthful messaging and authentic messengers), and considering outcomes (consider intended and unintended consequences). We present these considerations not as a fail-safe checklist to prevent unethical conduct in conservation messaging, but rather as points of reflection to consider in the design of ethical conservation messages and campaigns. We present a series of prompting questions to guide this process. We believe taking the time to reflect in this way paves the way for more effective and ethical strategies for conservation messaging, leading to more open, trusting, and sustainable relationships with our audiences.

"New technology and work: Exploring the challenges China; Institutional Quality; Multicultural Diversity Investigations into new technologies, employment and working conditions are timeless and consequently have occupied research, public policy, and popular fiction for centuries. However, in addition to the uncertainty created by the introduction of new technologies, the current coronavirus pandemic, with its associated impact on health and the economy, has led to increased volatility across the globe. The global medical crisis arising from the worldwide spread of COVID-19 is predicted to lead to a global economic crisis and subsequent deep depression. The resultant economic, social and political repercussions are likely to be felt for years or even decades to come, equalling the great depression of the last century. Consequently, it is difficult to make long-term accurate predictions about the impact of new technologies on industry, society, and labour. In this context, the aim of this introductory article to the themed volume is to consider the potential challenges and opportunities associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and potential impacts on work and workplaces. This introductory article comprises an international collection of research that examines the impact of technological change on employment and working conditions with consideration given to the additional impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

"Influencing factors on vehicle-pedestrian crash severity of school-aged pedestrians Crash Injuries; Crash; Random Parameters Every year, about 19 percent of vehicle-pedestrian crashes in Melbourne metropolitan area, Australia, involves pedestrians with less than 18 years of age or school-aged pedestrians. This paper aims to identify contributing factors on vehicle-pedestrian crash severity of this age group. Reasonable walking distance to schools is applied in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to identify vehicle-pedestrian crashes around schools. Then Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) and Cross-Validation (CV) technique are applied to explore significant factors. Results show that the distance of pedestrians from school is a significant factor on vehicle-pedestrian crash severity for this age group. This result could assist in identifying safe distance and safe zone around schools. Furthermore, Public health indicators such as income and commuting type from or to school found as other contributing factors to this crash type."
"Experimental and computational investigations of novel 3D printed square tubular lattice metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio Negative; Honeycomb Cores; Metamaterials Novel 3D printed square auxetic tubular lattice (SATL) structures were designed, fabricated and investigated. Their mechanical properties were examined by the finite element method and experiments. The height and wall thickness show different effects on the mechanical properties of SATL structures. Compared with the circular auxetic tubular (CATL) structures, the SATL structure has a lower peak force under axial load. Under lateral load, the SATL structure has higher stiffness and specific energy absorption. Moreover, the auxetic effect of the proposed SATL structure is also obvious under lateral load. Then, numerical investigations of several improved SATL structures were carried out, the results show that the improved square auxetic tubular lattice (ISATL) structures have stronger energy absorption capacity under axial and lateral loads. Due to their unique structural design and excellent mechanical properties, the SATL structures and ISATL structures have great potential for applications in civil engineering, vehicle crashworthiness and protective infrastructure."
"Evaluation of Florpyrauxifen-benzyl for the control of Cyperus aromaticus (Navua sedge) Acetolactate Synthase; Algicide; Amaranthus Tuberculatus Background: Cyperus aromaticus (Navua sedge) is a creeping perennial sedge common to tropical environments, currently threatening many agroecosystems and ecosystems in Pacific Island countries and northern Queensland in Australia. Objective: A glasshouse study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of florpyrauxifen-benzyl on C. aromaticus plants with and without established rhizomes. Methods: The plants with established rhizomes were treated at three application times being mowed, pre-flowering and flowering growth stages and plants without established rhizomes were treated at seedling, pre-flowering and flowering growth stages. At each application time, plants were treated with four rates of florpyrauxifen-benzyl: 0, 15, 30 and 60 g a.i. ha-1 and control. Results: There was no mortality in the plants with established rhizomes. Reduction in the number of tillers was observed at four weeks after treatment (WAT) in plants treated with 30 and 60 g a.i. ha-1 of herbicide, however, there was new growth from the rhizomes and the number of tillers increased at 8 WAT. Conversely, florpyrauxifen-benzyl provided above 95% control in plants without established rhizomes. Conclusions: These results indicate florpyrauxifen-benzyl can help manage a new C. aromaticus infestation prior to the establishment of rhizomes. However, it has little to no impact on C. aromaticus plants with established rhizomes, and other management options should be employed to control them."
"‘Grey’ exclusions matter: mapping illegal exclusionary practices and the implications for children with disabilities in England and Australia Inclusive Education; Special Educational Needs; Psychological Practice This paper provides an outline of, and rationale for, an international research project that will identify commonalities and disparities in illegal school exclusionary practices in Australia and England. The aims here are to situate such practices within a global context and to map the events and processes through which children and young people, particularly those with â€˜specialâ€™ educational needs and disabilities, are removed from school in Australia and England. The research we advocate is premised on evidence that inequitable and illegal exclusionary practices are endemic in education systems globally; hence, â€˜pushout syndromeâ€™ in the USA, â€˜off rollingâ€™ in England, facilitated â€˜dropoutâ€™ in Italy and â€˜grey exclusionsâ€™ in Australia. The authors argue that the repeated commissioning of research by national governments and school inspectorates, intended to accurately ascertain the scale of this problem and its impact on the life trajectories of the excluded, serves to defer meaningful action to prevent its occurrence. School exclusion, whether legal or illegal, can be conceptualized as a process rather than an event, and this paper discusses a descriptive continuum through which exclusionary practices in Australia and England can be mapped An experiential continuum is proposed that facilitates a thematic mapping of contributory factors, identified from a relevant literature, as a preliminary analytical framework for future research."
"Healthcare service, food security, and sustainable development: Main reasons to grow opium poppy in Myanmar Rohingya (People); Military Government; Junta This chapter aims to analyze discrimination and disadvantage of local farmers in the process of opium eradication in Myanmar based on their specific explanations. The author utilizes some data and information collected from official reports and statements of the Myanmar Opium Farmers' Forum (2013-2018). Some multiple sources from inside and outside Myanmar in terms of human rights of ethnic minorities' opium farmers are also added. The current findings point out that there are a number of concerns and disadvantages with local opium farmers to look for survival livelihood, food security, and sustainable development in ethnic minorities' communities in Myanmar, particularly at Shan and Kachin States. The chapter also calls for further researches with specific recommendations and effective solutions for local opium farmers in the next stages."
"Do differences in social environments explain gender differences in recreationalwalking across neighbourhoods? Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Within a city, gender differences in walking for recreation (WfR) vary significantly across neighbourhoods, although the reasons remain unknown. This cross-sectional study investigated the contribution of the social environment (SE) to explaining such variation, using 2009 data from the How Areas in Brisbane Influence healTh and AcTivity (HABITAT) study, including 7866 residents aged 42â€“67 years within 200 neighbourhoods in Brisbane, Australia (72.6% response rate). The analytical sample comprised 200 neighbourhoods and 6643 participants (mean 33 per neighbourhood, range 8â€“99, 95% CI 30.6â€“35.8). Self-reported weekly minutes of WfR were categorised into 0 and 1â€“840 mins. The SE was conceptualised through neighbourhood-level perceptions of social cohesion, incivilities and safety from crime. Analyses included multilevel binomial logistic regression with gender as main predictor, adjusting for age, socioeconomic position, residential self-selection and neighbourhood disadvantage. On average, women walked more for recreation than men prior to adjustment for covariates. Gender differences in WfR varied significantly across neighbourhoods, and the magnitude of the variation for women was twice that of men. The SE did not explain neighbourhood differences in the genderâ€“WfR relationship, nor the between-neighbourhood variation in WfR for men or women. Neighbourhood-level factors seem to influence the WfR of men and women differently, with women being more sensitive to their environment, although Brisbaneâ€™s SE did not seem such a factor."
"The Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture: Findings from Households in Vietnam Crops; CERES (Experiment); Climate Change Impact This paper examines farm household-level impacts of climate change by examining the relationship between climatic variables and Vietnamese agricultural output. The Ricardian technique is applied with panel data which accounts for both adaptation strategies and household characteristics. This study proposes a two-stage Hsiao model to correct for collinearity between climatic variables and individual effects. The results show that in the dry season, increases in temperatures are beneficial to all farms in the warmer southern regions, while increases in precipitation will damage only irrigated farms in the Central and South regions. The impact of higher temperature in the wet season is similar, except that it will negatively affect net revenue of irrigated farms in the long run. More rainfall in the wet season will increase net revenue in the North region only. Finally, this study combines the estimated results with future climate scenarios to predict how future changes in climate will affect farmers on aggregate."
"Surprising Pseudogobius: Molecular systematics of benthic gobies reveals new insights into estuarine biodiversity (Teleostei: Gobiiformes) Animals; Maccullochella Macquariensis; Percichthyidae Snubnose gobies (genus Pseudogobius: Gobionellinae) are ubiquitous to, and important components of, estuarine ecosystems of the Indo-west Pacific. These small benthic fishes occur in freshwater, brackish and marine habitats such as mangroves, sheltered tide pools and lowland streams, and represent a model group for understanding the biodiversity and biogeography of estuarine fauna. To develop the species-level framework required for a concurrent morphological taxonomic appraisal, we undertook thorough sampling around the extensive Australian coastline, referenced to international locations, as part of a molecular systematic review using both nuclear and mitochondrial markers. The results indicate that while there are currently eight recognised species, the true diversity is close to double this, with a hotspot of endemism located in Australia. Complicated patterns were observed in southern Australia owing to two differing zones of introgression/admixture. Key drivers of diversity in the group appear to include plate tectonics, latitude, and historic barriers under glacial maxima, where an interplay between ready dispersal and habitat specialisation has led to regional panmixia but frequent geographic compartmentalisation within past and present landscapes. The findings have significant implications for biodiversity conservation, coastal and estuarine development, the basic foundations of field ecology, and for applied use such as in biomonitoring."
"The fragility of results and bias in empirical research: an exploratory exposition Firm; Bribes; Anti-corruption Measures The results of empirical work in economics and finance are typically sensitive, inter alia, to model specification, sample period, variable definitions and estimation methods. If the underlying issue attracts bias of some sort, the reporting of the results tends to be selective, intended to confirm prior beliefs, which may be ideologically-driven, or to make the paper more publishable. In this paper the fragility (variability and sensitivity) of empirical results is demonstrated and the process whereby it enables research selection bias is described. For this purpose, several research areas are considered, including the determinants of economic growth, the effect of gender on risk aversion, the determinants of capital structure, the J-curve effect, the effect of corruption on foreign direct investment, and the Kuznets curve."
"Investigating on-road lane maintenance and speed regulation in post-stroke driving: A pilot case-control study Elderly Driver; Automobile Driving; Traffic Behavior Stroke can adversely affect the coordination and judgement of drivers due to executive dysfunction, which is relatively common in the post-stroke population but often undetected. Quantitatively examining vehicle control performance in post-stroke driving becomes essential to inspect whether and where post-stroke older drivers are risky. To date, it is unclear as to which indicators, such as lane keeping or speed control, can differentiate the driving performance of post-stroke older drivers from that of normal (neurotypical) older drivers. By employing a case-control design using advanced vehicle movement tracking and analysis technology, this pilot study aimed to compare the variations in driving trajectory, lane keeping and speed control between the two groups of older drivers using spatial and statistical techniques. The results showed that the mean standard deviation of lane deviation (SDLD) in post-stroke participants was higher than that of normal participants in complex driving tasks (U-turn and left turn) but almost the same in simple driving tasks (straight line sections). No statistically significant differences were found in the speed control performance. The findings indicate that, although older drivers can still drive as they need to after a stroke, the decline in cognitive abilities still imposes a higher cognitive workload and more effort for post-stroke older drivers. Future studies can investigate post-stroke adultsâ€™ driving behaviour at more challenging driving scenarios or design driving intervention programs to improve their executive function in driving."
"Marine Protists and Rhodotorula Yeast as Bio-Convertors of Marine Waste into Nutrient-Rich Deposits for Mangrove Ecosystems Schizochytrium; Labyrinthulida; Docosahexaenoic Acid This paper represents a comprehensive study of two new thraustochytrids and a marine Rhodotorula red yeast isolated from Australian coastal waters for their abilities to be a potential renewable feedstock for the nutraceutical, food, fishery and bioenergy industries. Mixotrophic growth of these species was assessed in the presence of different carbon sources: glycerol, glucose, fructose, galactose, xylose, and sucrose, starch, cellulose, malt extract, and potato peels. Up to 14 g DW/L (4.6 gDW/L-day and 2.8 gDW/L-day) of biomass were produced by Aurantiochytrium and Thraustochytrium species, respectively. Thraustochytrids biomass contained up to 33% DW of lipids, rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6, 124 mg/g DW); up to 10.2 mg/gDW of squalene and up to 61 Î¼g/gDW of total carotenoids, composed of astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, echinenone, and Î²-carotene. Along with the accumulation of these added-value chemicals in biomass, thraustochytrid representatives showed the ability to secrete extracellular polysaccharide matrixes containing lipids and proteins. Rhodotorula sp lipids (26% DW) were enriched in palmitic acid (C16:0, 18 mg/gDW) and oleic acid (C18:1, 41 mg/gDW). Carotenoids (87 Î¼g/gDW) were mainly represented by Î²-carotene (up to 54 Î¼g/gDW). Efficient growth on organic and inorganic sources of carbon and nitrogen from natural and anthropogenic wastewater pollutants along with intracellular and extracellular production of valuable nutrients makes the production of valuable chemicals from isolated species economical and sustainable."
"Public Administration, Habermas and the Crisis of Legitimacy in the Youth Justice System: An Australian Case Study Emergencies; Emergency Law; Giorgio Agamben Using an Australian case in which a liberal-democratic state systematically breached the human rights of children involved in in its youth justice system, this article explores the idea of â€˜legitimacyâ€™ and â€˜legitimation crisisâ€™ in the modern administrative state. We acknowledge the relevance of Habermasâ€™ account of a crisis of legitimacy when responding to Carl Schmittâ€™s challenge to the claim to legitimacy vested in liberal rule of law principles found in Schmittâ€™s account of state sovereignty and the power to declare exceptions. In this way we highlight some issues with how conventional public administration studies have taken the liberal framework and principles like the rule of law and equality of all before the law for granted. We argue that this field of study has paid too little attention to the role of sovereign power evident when the executive creates what Dyzenhaus and Vermeules refer to as legal â€˜black and gray holesâ€™. This highlights the value of reconsidering the concern by mainstream public administration research and theory with questions of administrative discretion and the need to pay much more attention to the role of the executive in the administration of systems like the justice system."
"An Overview of Artificial General Intelligence: Recent Developments and Future Challenges Mind Uploading; Existential Risk; Artificial Intelligence The defense sphere of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is developing exponentially. Notwithstanding, there is an under the definition of the character of human beliefs pertaining to AGI associations. Distinctive AGI protection scholars formulated numerous hypotheses regarding the existence of human beliefs, but contradictions exist. This study provides an analysis of what AGI protection scholars, up to the beginning of 2019, have written about the essence of human beliefs. It is generally advised to use a theory classification system, where the ideas are evaluated following the degree of their sophistication and size of behaviorists-internalists, equally because of the scope of their consensus mankind. We propose several well-supported hypotheses to indicate the difficulty of describing the character of human beliefs and a few meta-level theories are needed."
"Gender relations and social media: a grounded theory inquiry of young Vietnamese women’s self-presentations on Facebook Vietnam; Intimate Partner Violence; Sexual Health Since the introduction of Äá»•i Má»›i (market economic reforms) in 1986, Vietnam has experienced rapid social, cultural, economic and technological changes. The purpose of this study is to explore the nexus between gender relations and social media with a focus on how young urban Vietnamese women present themselves on Facebook. Grounded theory was employed to inquire into this phenomenon, revealing that the participants use various self-presentation techniques (strategies) including an ideal appearance, competency (mastery) and a positive image. The participantsâ€™ self-presentations were found to be simultaneously influenced by Confucian ethics, socialist ideology and neoliberal global culture. The intersection of these social forces has changed the nature of gender relations and expectations for young Vietnamese women, leading to the emergence of a neoliberal gendered self in their presentations on Facebook. This study foregrounds how gender relations in early twenty-first century Vietnam are being reconfigured by competing values and how these can be analyzed through and influenced by social media use."
"Fijian infrastructural citizenship: spaces of electricity sharing and informal power grids in an informal settlement Informality; Slums; Governance Infrastructure has historically been absent in informal settlements in Oceania. Oceanic governments have deliberately withheld infrastructure to these settlements denying them essential resources, human rights, and ways of life. Current reforms in urban policy seek to rectify this record by promising more inclusive infrastructures. In this article, I investigate the effect a promised electricity infrastructure had in an informal settlement in Suva, Fiji. Prior to development, residents created their own infrastructures that equitably shared electricity in spaces of electricity sharing. The initiation of infrastructural works destroyed this local infrastructure embedded in local social relations. While residents waited for this promised infrastructure to be constructed, they erected informal power grids that mimicked the exclusive and commoditised provision of electricity of the planned infrastructure. I argue that the promise of infrastructural development in informal settlements in Oceania is reshaping previously inclusive forms infrastructural citizenship in favour of more exclusive infrastructural relationships."
"On being posthuman in human spaces: critical posthumanist social work with interspecies families Animal Assisted Therapy; Service Dogs; Animals Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes a critical posthumanist orientation to social work as an approach to address the impediments to care experienced by interspecies families. Secondly, it challenges the anthropocentric assumptions that underpin this exclusion of nonhuman family members in human services disciplines such as social work. Design/methodology/approach: This article presents primary data from a qualitative study into social work and other human services practice in the family violence and homelessness sectors in the state of Victoria, Australia. Findings: Social workers undertook companion animal-inclusive practice to counter vulnerability to interspecies families caused by gender- and species-based violence, and by homelessness. Gender- and species-based violence was exacerbated by a lack of refuge options, and contributed to women considering their companion animals to be their children. The vulnerability that homelessness brought upon interspecies families was amplified by stigma within and external to social work and related professions, and the impediment that experiences of homelessness had on being able to provide care for their nonhuman family members. These factors shaped practice with interspecies families. Scope for future practice was also identified. Research limitations/implications: The research findings can be used to inform policy change that includes consideration of nonhuman family members, as well as critical posthuman program design in social work education. Originality/value: Companion animal-inclusive practice with interspecies families in social work is an under researched area, and there is little empirical data available on the nature of this work in Australia. This paper addresses this gap by centring social workers' own accounts of practice. This paper has scope to contribute to education in social work and other welfare fields, with the potential to empower students to challenge assumptions about social work being solely focused on human-centred concerns."
"Greenhouse gas emissions of different fly ash based geopolymer concretes in building construction Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali Replacing virgin materials with recycled or sustainable materials to reduce energy consumptions and emissions is the focus of contemporary research to reduce building related emissions. Geopolymer concrete produced using 100% fly ash is a similar sustainable construction material capable of replacing Portland Cement (PC) concrete. As a replacement for PC, fly ash seems to be a sustainable solution, however the benefits from the production process of fly ash geopolymer (FAGP) concrete is the subject of considerable debate. In addition, factors such as local availability and transportation issues could potentially increase the emission profile of FAGP concrete. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the emission profiles for different types of fly ash in Australia considering availability and transportation. A case study and a scenario analysis are also presented to demonstrate the factors that affect the Green House Gas (GHG) emission profile of FAGP manufacture. The results indicate that to the GHG emission profile for FAGP concrete changes considerably based on the material availability, transportation and mix design. Alkali activators and elevated heat curing processes also significantly contribute the total GHG emissions of FAGP concrete production. The results further signify that the case study location could influence the employment of FAGP concrete in terms of GHG emissions. Further studies are encouraged on optimising the cost, GHG emissions, availability and strength characteristics to strike a balance between in sustainability for selecting the best FAGP type for construction. The results also provide the initial factors to be considered in developing a guideline for employing sustainable materials in the building industry."
"The quality agenda in early childhood education: Questioning local and global policy perspectives Early Childhood Education and Care; Nursery Schools; Preschool Education This book investigates notions of â€˜qualityâ€™ in early childhood settings both in Australia and globally. After experiencing quality reform as an educator, the author turned to research as a means by which to better understand early childhood quality reform and agenda over time. This book questions how early childhood reform policy and agenda have constructed quality - what it is presumed to be and do - over time and the implications of these â€˜truthsâ€™. Taking a Foucauldian governmentality view of the history of Australian early childhood services, the impetus for the quality reform era, the quality reform policy assemblages and the contemporary post-reform era, this book rigorously examines prevailing policy assumptions, ambitions and deployments of quality, and warns of an emerging ambition for â€˜only qualityâ€™ settings in early childhood. This book will appeal to early childhood students and educators, education policy sociologists and all who are interested in reclaiming early childhood education and care."
"An Off-Site Supervision Model of Field Education Practice: Innovating While Remaining Rigorous in a Shifting Field Education Context Social Work Students; Work Identity; Placement Traditional approaches to social work field education are being tested due to increasing enrolments, increased competition for placements and reduced availability of social work supervisors. This article presents research findings of one Victorian University's off-site supervision (OSS) model, which examined the experiences of students, off-site supervisors, task supervisors (TS), and the University Field Education (FE) team. Three themes were identified: the benefits, challenges, and opportunities for the development of the OSS model. Nearly all student participants reported good to excellent OSS experiences, could see the merits in external group supervision, and reported having a good placement. However, there is still a perception among students that on-site supervision is preferred over OSS despite many not having experience of the former. IMPLICATIONS The research results suggest greater valuing of the OSS model within The Australian Social Education and Accreditation Standards (ASWEAS). Adequate resources, role clarity, alignment of off-site supervisors with placement context, and effective communication processes are required for off-site supervisors to provide quality placement opportunities. Further research involving stakeholders experienced in both on-site supervision and OSS models is needed into the benefits and limitations of both approaches."
"Graduate employability: Beyond the skills agenda Employability; Competency; Soft Skills Employability is high on the university agenda worldwide and the dominant discourse of enhancing graduate employability (GE) in higher education focuses on the skills agenda. This chapter challenges the accepted link between the skills agenda and GE. It forwards the message that the process of enhancing GE should go beyond the instrumental approach of equipping students with the knowledge and skills employers require. Rather, the student employment trajectory is complex, and higher education or the first employment is just the beginning of that trajectory. Universities should not only help their students develop their knowledge and skills, but also draw student awareness to the outside societal and labour market conditions and find ways to help students better prepare to be more flexible and adaptable to the local and international working environment. It is also time for a more meaningful dialogue among related stakeholders to identify collaborated roles and responsibilities of each party in the process of enhancing GE."
"Using species distribution models and decision tools to direct surveys and identify potential translocation sites for a critically endangered species Maximum Entropy; Ecosystem; Environmental Space Aim: Occurrence records for cryptic species are typically limited or highly uncertain, leaving their distributions poorly resolved and hampering conservation. This can apply to well-studied species, and increased survey effort and/or novel methods are required to improve distribution data. Here, we paired species distribution modelling (SDM) with decision tools to direct surveys for the critically endangered Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) outside its current restricted range. We also assessed survey areas for their suitability to host translocations. Location: Victoria, Australia. Method: We used both recent and historic records (now out of range and spatially uncertain) of Leadbeater's possum to build SDMs using MaxEnt. The SDMs informed an initial multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) that enabled prioritization of 80 survey sites across seven forest patches (13â€“145 km outside the known range), which we surveyed using camera traps. Site and vegetation data were used in a post-survey MCDA to rank their potential translocation suitability. Results: The SDM predictions were consistent with the speciesâ€™ ecology, identifying cold areas with high rainfall that had not recently burnt as suitable. The spatial uncertainty of records did not exert a strong influence on either model predictions or the ranking of patches for surveys. Camera trap surveys yielded records of 19 native species, with Leadbeater's possum detected in only one survey patch, 13 km outside of its previously known range. The post-survey MCDA identified three forest patches as potentially suitable for conservation translocations, and these priorities were not sensitive to the decision criteria used. Main conclusions: The approach outlined here prioritized survey effort over a large area, resulting in detection of Leadbeater's possum in one new patch. The potential translocation sites identified could present an important risk-spreading measure for the species given the threat posed by bushfire. Combining SDMs and decision tools can help target surveys and guide subsequent conservation strategies."
"Challenges Inherent in Controlling Prickly Pear Species; a Global Review of the Properties of Opuntia stricta, Opuntia ficus-indica and Opuntia monacantha Dactylopius; Hemiptera; Cactaceae Opuntia species (prickly pear) were deliberately introduced to many countries around the world for fruit, cochineal dye production, living fencing or as ornamentals. They are now some of the worldâ€™s most significant weeds, particularly in regions with warm and or dry climates, as they pose threats to economic and environmental assets. In addition, they can cause considerable health issues for humans and animals. Opuntia spp. have prolific reproduction abilities, being able to reproduce both vegetatively and by seed. They have generalist pollination and dispersal requirements, which promotes their establishment and spread. Opuntia stricta, O. monacantha and O. ficus-indica are the most globally widespread of the Opuntia spp. In many countries, biological control agents, particularly the cactus moth (Cactoblastis cactorum) and various cochineal insects from the Dactylopius genus, have successfully reduced land-scape scale populations. On a smaller scale, controlling these weeds by either injecting or spraying the cladodes with herbicides can provide effective control. Care must be taken during herbicide treatments as any untreated areas will regenerate. While biological control is the most cost and time effective control method for landscape-scale infestations, further research into the combined efficacy of herbicides, fire, grubbing and pre-burial techniques would be beneficial for land managers to control small-scale and establishing populations. It would also be useful to have greater knowledge of the potential seedbank longevity and seed ecology of these species so that integrated management strategies can be developed to not only deal with initial populations but also the subsequent seedling regrowth."
"Renewable thermal energy driven desalination process for a sustainable management of reverse osmosis reject water Distillation; Direct Contact; Membrane A sustainable circular economy involves designing and promoting products with the least environmental impact. This research presents an experimental performance investigation of direct contact membrane distillation with feed approaching supersaturation salinity, which can be useful for the sustainable management of reverse osmosis reject water. Traditionally, reject water from the reverse osmosis systems is discharged in the sea or in the source water body. The reinjection of high salinity reject water into the sea has the potential to put the local sea environment at risk. This paper presents a design of a solar membrane distillation system that can achieve close to zero liquid discharge. The theoretical and experimental analysis on the performance of the lab scale close to zero liquid discharge system that produces supersaturated brine is studied. The lab-based experiments were conducted at boundary conditions, which were close to the real-world conditions where feed water temperatures ranged between 40â—¦C and 85â—¦C and the permeate water temperatures ranged between 5â—¦C and 20â—¦C. The feed water was supplied at salinity between 70,000 ppm to 110,000 ppm, similar to reject from reverse osmosis. The experimental results show that the maximum flux of 17.03 kg/m2Â·h was achieved at a feed temperature of 80â—¦C, a feed salinity of 10,000 ppm, a permeate temperature of 5â—¦C and at constant feed and a permeate flow rate of 4 L/min. Whereas for the same conditions, the theoretical mass flux was 18.23 kg/m2Â·h. Crystal formation was observed in the feed tank as the feed water volume reduced and the salinity increased, reaching close to 308,000 ppm TDS. At this condition, the mass flux approached close to zero due to crystallisation on the membrane surface. This study provides advice on the practical limitations for the use of membrane distillation to achieve close to zero liquid discharge."
"Are you puffing your Children's future away? Energy poverty and childhood exposure to passive smoking Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort We examine whether having a parent who smoked during one's childhood or adolescence increases the probability of being in energy poverty in adulthood. We find that people who had a parent who smoked when they were young are 0.8â€“1.4 percentage points more likely to be in energy poverty later in life. Various checks suggest that this relationship can be regarded as being plausibly causal. We identify health, human capital, labour market outcomes and non-cognitive traits as channels through which early life exposure to passive smoking increases the likelihood of being in energy poverty. Our results have important implications for early life interventions to address the deficits caused by exposure to passive smoking."
"Using measures of efficiency for regionally-targeted smallholder policy intervention: The case of Pakistan's horticulture sector Agriculture; Stochastic Frontier Model; Metafrontier The empirical literature on the sources of production efficiency mostly focuses on technical and scale efficiency, and the relative importance of mix efficiency is often overlooked. This paper estimates input-oriented technical and mix efficiency using a farm-level survey dataset of 730 smallholder horticulture farms in Pakistan. We estimate a Bayesian stochastic production frontier model to draw precise statistical inferences by using finite sample properties. We find that the estimated mean mix inefficiency (0.65) is roughly as large as mean technical inefficiency (0.64). Moreover, we detect large technical and mix efficiency disparities across agro-climatic zones and farm sizes, which we attribute to suboptimal farm practices. We conclude that policy-makers should focus on strategies that target to improve both technical and mix inefficiency."
"Optimization of load dispatch strategies for an islanded microgrid connected with renewable energy sources Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems This paper evaluates the design and optimization of an islanded hybrid microgrid for various load dispatch strategies by assessing the optimal sizing of each component, the power system responses and different cost analysis of the microgrid. Four divisions of the northern side of Bangladesh namely, Mymensingh, Rangpur, Rajshahi and Sylhet hybrid microgrids incorporating solar PV, wind turbine, battery storage, diesel generator and a load of 27.31 kW have been optimized for five different dispatch strategies: (i) Load Following, (ii) Cycle Charging, (iii) Generator Order, (iv) Combined Dispatch and (v) HOMER predictive dispatch strategy. The proposed microgrids have been optimized to reduce the Net Present Cost, CO2 emission and Levelized Cost of Energy. All the five dispatch strategies for the four microgrids have been analyzed in HOMER Pro, and subsequently, the power system responses and feasibility analysis of the microgrids have been performed in MATLAB Simulink. The results obtained in this study provide a guideline to estimate component sizes and costs for the optimal operation of the proposed microgrids under various load dispatch scenarios. The simulation results suggest that the Load Following is the best dispatch strategy having the lowest Net Present Cost of 149,794 USD, Levelized Cost of Energy of 0.204 USD/kWh, Operating cost of 3,698 USD and CO2 emission of 3,298 kg/year with a stable power system response. Combined Dispatch is found to be the worst strategy having the maximum Levelized Cost of Energy of 0.532 USD/kWh, Net Present Cost of 415,030 USD, Operating cost of 15,394 USD and Green House Gas emissions of 17,266 kg/year and comparatively poor power system responses. Finally, a brief comparative analysis has been presented between designed microgrid system and other hybrid energy systems and conventional power stations in terms of Levelized Cost of Energy, Net Present Cost, CO2 emissions and operating cost."
"Australians’ experience, barriers and willingness towards consuming edible insects as an emerging protein source Edible Insects; Hermetia Illucens; Insect Increasing global populations and limitations on the natural resources required in food production such as land and water will place further pressure on an already strained food production system. To meet the future food production requirements, it is essential to find viable alternatives to current food sources, without the high resource challenges. Protein production is of particular concern and insects are a nutritious and sustainable source yet, despite a rich history in parts of the world, Australians have been reluctant to adopt the practice as a societal norm. This study aimed to explore Australian consumersâ€™ experiences with edible insects, identify barriers to consumption, and explore possible factors that may motivate Australians to consume insects. A total of 601 participants (23.8% male, 76.2% female), completed an online survey using a variety of open-ended questions; 5- or 7-point Likert scales and check-all-that-apply questions. Consumer willingness was measured through self-reporting willingness-to-try insects or insect-based foods. Results indicated 35.4% of participants had previously consumed insects, with Orthoptera (crickets, grasshoppers) the most commonly consumed order (60.1%). Participants with no previous experience consuming insects cited â€˜lack of opportunityâ€™ as the main reason (57.2%). â€˜Increased accessibilityâ€™ (56.6%) and â€˜increased nutrition knowledgeâ€™ (56.6%) were identified as major factors that may increase the likelihood of future insect consumption. Participants reporting that they were willing to try insects were most likely to accept â€˜insect-based flourâ€™ (65.6%) and â€˜chocolate-covered antsâ€™ (52.1%). By providing increased opportunity, accessibility and education of insect-based food products, a higher proportion of Australians may be willing to eat insects, particularly if presented in indistinguishable forms (i.e. flour). This may lead to a greater acceptance of insects as an alternative, more sustainable protein source than previously anticipated."
"Design and construction of an innovative pavilion using topological optimization and robotic fabrication Topology Optimization; Numerical Methods; Compliant Mechanisms This research explores innovations in structural design and construction through the generative design technique BESO (Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization) [1] and the application of robotic fabrication to produce efficient and elegant spatial structures. The innovative pavilion discussed in this paper demonstrates a design and fabrication process and the collaboration between architecture and engineering research groups through a series of small-scale test models and a full-scale model of topologically optimized spatial structures. The focus of this work is the use of a modified BESO technique to optimize the structure which features branches of various sizes, inspired by Gaudi's Sagrada Familia Bacilica, and the introduction of large-scale robotic 3D printing developed at RMIT University. The advantages of the new design and construction process are efficient material usage and elegant structural forms."
"Factors confounding koala habitat mapping at multiple decision-making scales Koala; Animals; Retroviridae The Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal marsupial found throughout southeastern Australia. A high risk of extinction in some areas requires adherence to legislation mandating protection of high-quality habitat. The Koala primarily eats leaves of the Eucalyptus genus and wildlife managers are, in most cases, currently dependent on habitat maps depicting food resource availability derived from low-resolution regional-extent (~100,000 hectares) vegetation maps. These maps might not capture resource variability at planning extents (0.1â€“300 ha), or at resolutions where Koala ecology processes operate (5â€“50 ha). Consequently, potentially high-quality habitat may not be considered in planning decisions. Whether low-resolution habitat mapping adequately captures food resource variability is therefore relevant to map users at non-regional extents. We examined four different broad-scale low-resolution habitat maps within a small area (150 ha) in southeast Queensland and compared the classifications of each. Map units were generally ranked in the same hierarchical order; however, differences in methodologies meant that, between maps, some units varied widely in assigned habitat quality. Two maps were assessed using quantitative Queensland Herbarium data, and field data we collected. Assessment using overstorey species emphasised habitat quality differences between habitat map units better than the alternative whole-of-canopy method. Maps relying on interpretation of vegetation descriptions for habitat class definition sometimes overestimated food tree cover proportions and stakeholders need to be cognisant of these limitations. One method assigned Very Low Suitability to a 60-ha focal study site containing evidence of Koala use, and we strongly recommend that field validation should be an integral part of habitat management at these scales. We conclude that, rather than mapping approaches encompassing several habitat attributes within a single map, layered datasets, each with specific attributes, would provide greater utility for stakeholders by allowing them to use layers individually or in combination as required."
"Optimal parameter estimation in activated sludge process based wastewater treatment practice Activated Sludge; Waste Water; Crack Opening Displacement Activated sludge models (ASMs) are often used in the simulation of the wastewater treatment process to evaluate whether the effluent quality parameters of a wastewater treatment plant meet the standards. The premise of successful simulation is to choose appropriate dynamic parameters for the model. A niche based adaptive invasive weed optimization (NAIWO) algorithm is proposed in this paper to find the appropriate kinetic parameters of activated sludge model 1 (ASM1). The niche idea is used to improve the possibility of convergence to the global optimal solution. In addition, the adaptive mechanism and periodic operator are introduced to improve the convergence speed and accuracy of the algorithm. Finally, NAIWO is used to optimize the parameters of ASM1. Comparison with other intelligent algorithms such as invasive weed optimization (IWO), genetic algorithm (GA), and bat algorithm (BA) showed the higher convergence accuracy and faster convergence speed of NAIWO. The results showed that the ASM1 model results agreed with measured data with smaller errors."
"Berbera Port Special Economic Zone: Golden Calf or Trojan Horse? Somalia; Horn of Africa; Failed States The African country of Somalia has been designated a â€˜failed stateâ€™ because of its persistent warfare, the presence of terrorist groups and the collapse of the central government. There is no effective rule of law and little protection of the private sector. The only real forms of income for the country are international assistance and remittances received from overseas Somalis. One possible means of increasing economic activity is to build a special economic zone in connection with Berbera Port, which has historically been an important trading centre linking East Africa and West Asia. Dubaiâ€™s DP World signed a contract to provide just such a development, but that agreement has subsequently been repudiated as a result of diplomatic issues. Meanwhile, China is seeking to extend its engagement in the region. Investment from either of these two sources would be problematic but it seems there are no other options available. Is it possible for Somalia to pursue a policy of economic development under current conditions without ceding sovereignty of its territory and its economic activities? Would it matter if this did happen? This case would be useful for students taking courses in international business or the political economy of international business."
"The effects of the Paris climate agreement on stock markets: evidence from the German stock market Event Study Methodology; Abnormal Returns; Risk and Return We investigate the effects of the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement on the German stock market by considering the impact of 20 announcements pertaining to the Agreement on 17 industries. The event study methodology is used for this purpose, together with several robustness tests, such as the nonparametric rank test and non-parametric conditional distribution approach. The change in systematic risk following the announcements is captured by using various risk models. In general, we find that the Paris Climate Agreement is achieving its objectives in the short run. Our results show that the announcements affected polluting industries in terms of risk and return. Furthermore, we observe two distinct diamond risk structures when (1) Conference of the Parties (COP) 21 took place, and (2) the Agreement came into force."
"Amine-Infused Hydrogels with Nonaqueous Solvents: Facile Platforms to Control CO2Capture Performance Carbon Dioxide Capture; Tetraethylenepentamine; Adsorption Amine-infused hydrogels provide a facile platform for developing solid sorbents with improved CO2 capture performance relative to that of their liquid counterparts. In this study, we develop hydrogel materials that can be easily manufactured at a large scale and have high flow gas permeability characteristics, fast uptake kinetics, and minimal performance degradation after recycling, properties which are particularly important for applications in direct air capture (DAC). To overcome water loss issues associated with hydrogel materials for DAC, we have introduced high-boiling-point/nonaqueous solvent systems, which significantly lowered the solvent loss, leading to dramatically improved recyclability. Among the materials developed, cross-linked poly(N-2-hydroxyethylacrylamide) (PHEAA) infused with diethanolamine (DEA) exhibited 7.82 and 2.90 wt % CO2 uptake with pure CO2 and DAC, respectively. Interestingly, by changing the hydrogel platform between either a cross-linked superabsorbent [i.e., poly(acrylamide/sodium acrylate)], PHEAA, or poly(acrylamide) (PolyAA) and impregnating with different amines/solvents, the uptake kinetics could be controlled and significantly improved. In fact, the PolyAA system impregnated with DEA in ethylene glycol showed 90% of the total capacity (6.37%) in 350 s (vs 4300 s in the case of the PHEAA/DEA system) as well as an enhanced amine efficiency (0.76 vs 0.28 mol CO2 per amine). Thus, this study demonstrates the use of different nonaqueous solvents on readily synthesized hydrogel platforms to improve the DAC uptake efficiency and kinetics. The fast kinetics enable shorter adsorption/desorption cycles, which will be advantageous in improving the CO2 uptake selectivity and reducing the sorption of water in larger-scale implementations of this approach, in both urban and industrial applications."
"Superimposed microplastic pollution in a coastal metropolis Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter The mitigation of microplastic pollution in the environment calls for a better understanding of the sources and transportation, especially from land sources to the open ocean. We conducted a large-scale investigation of microplastic pollution across the Greater Melbourne Area and the Western Port area, Australia, spanning gradients of land-use from un-developed catchments in conservation areas to more heavily-developed areas. Microplastics were detected in 94% of water samples and 96% of sediment samples, with abundances ranging from 0.06 to 2.5 items/L in water and 0.9 to 298.1 items/kg in sediment. The variation of microplastic abundance in sediments was closely related to that of the overlying waters. Fiber was the most abundant (89.1% and 68.6% of microplastics in water and sediment respectively), and polyester was the dominant polymer in water and sediment. The size of more than 40% of all total microplastics observed was less than 1 mm. Both light and dense polymers of different shapes were more abundant in sediments than those in water, indicating that there is microplastic accumulation in sediments. The abundance of microplastics was higher near coastal cities than at less densely-populated inland areas. A spatial analysis of the data suggests that the abundance of microplastics increases downstream in rivers and accumulates in estuaries and the lentic reaches of these rivers. Correlation and redundancy analysis were used to explore the associations between microplastic pollution and different land-use types. More microplastics and polymer types were found at areas with large amounts of commercial, industrial and transport activities. Microplastic abundances were also correlated with mean particle size. Microplastic hotspots within a coastal metropolis might be caused by a combination of natural accumulation via hydrological dynamics and contribution from increasing anthropogenic influences. Our results strongly suggest that coastal metropolis superimposed on increasing microplastic levels in waterbodies from inland areas to the estuaries and open oceans. A coastal metropolis first receives microplastic inputs from upstream then magnifies its abundance and transportation via urban activities."

"Integrated reporting, financial reporting quality and cost of debt Voluntary Disclosure; Firm; International Financial Reporting Standards Purpose: Although proponents of integrated reporting (IR) advocate that this emerging practice has the potential to transform corporate reporting, the eventuation of this expectation would depend on the incentive IR provides to firms. This study aims to examine whether IR is associated with cost of debt and whether IR moderates the relationship between financial reporting quality and cost of debt. Design/methodology/approach: Based on insights drawn from information asymmetry and agency theories, the authors develop models that link IR and financial reporting quality with a firmâ€™s cost of debt. The authors analyze 847 firm-year observations drawn from non-financial firms traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, for the period between 2009 and 2015. Findings: The authors find that firms that provide integrated reports tend to have a lower cost of debt than those do not provide IR. The authors also find an inverse association between financial reporting quality and cost of debt, and that integrated reports accentuate this association. The findings suggest that the debt market perceives value in the information presented in integrated reports beyond what is furnished in financial reports. Originality/value: To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this study is the first to document evidence suggesting that the debt market perceives value in the information presented in integrated reports, beyond what is furnished in financial reports."
"China's E-Commerce: Empowering Rural Women? Cadres; China; Central Committee This article employs a feminist political economy perspective to explore the connection between e-commerce, entrepreneurship and gender in rural China. It discusses gendered engagement with, and discourses of, the new digital economy represented by Taobao villages, and asks: how has the success of rural e-commerce impacted the evolving gender mandate and hierarchy in a competitive market economy in rural China? Has rural women's participation in digital economic activities changed their gendered roles and the patriarchal structure in their family and village? This article argues that women's socioeconomic enablement does not necessarily translate into cultural and political empowerment. The enabling potential of female entrepreneurship is tempered by traditional constraints on women and digital capitalist exploitation of their cheap, flexible and docile labour."
"A comparative method of air emission impact assessment for building construction activities Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Different construction activities may indicate distinct environmental impacts due to their uniqueness. Ability to assess and compare the environmental impacts from different construction activities can aid the process of minimising emissions at different building construction processes. The study presents a comparative impact assessment methodology to evaluate environmental impacts at different activities during the building construction stage. Significant impact related construction activities for five major impact categories namely global warming potential (GWP 100), acidification potential (AP), Eutrophication potential (EP), Photochemical oxidation formation potential (POFP) and Human toxicity potential (HTP) are compared from the global, regional and local perspectives. A case study of a residential building in Australia is used to demonstrate the application of the functions of the developed method. The results of the case study indicated that the method can be effectively used to compare environmental impacts of different construction activities at different geographical perspectives considered. The method can be used by designers and contractors in comparing impacts of various construction activities to identify the most emission effective construction processes."
"The spatial varying relationship between services of the train network and residential property values in Melbourne, Australia Property Values; Railroad; Housing Prices This study investigates the spatial effects of the service frequency and transport interchange facilities of rail stations on residential property values for the entire metropolitan train network in Melbourne. Residential properties are classified as either detached or attached dwellings. Given that a traditional hedonic price model cannot handle the spatial dependence and spatial non-stationarity of the housing market, several geographically weighted regression (GWR) models are used and multicollinearity is considered; the model with the Euclidean distance metric outperforms others. Results indicate that the service frequency and facilities of the stations influence the residential property values in a spatially variable way. For every 1 km closer to the train stations, an increase in the frequency of the train services per unit results in a change in the residential property values ranging from âˆ’4.01% to 2.71%; an improvement in the transport interchange facilities per unit results in a change in the residential property values ranging from âˆ’29.93% to 47.04%. Crime and retail activities that indirectly affect the relationship between rail stations and residential property values are also identified. For every 1 km closer to the train stations, the crime density increases significantly from 5.64% to 42.88% and this occurs in one-fifth of the areas in Melbourne. In contrast, the relationship between retail activities and train stations remains spatially stable. This study complements the relatively scarce literature on the link between railway service levels and residential property values while extending the case study to the local level."
"World cloud: A prototype data choralification of text documents Data Mining; Clavier; User Studies Algorithmic composition is extended to textual data, demonstrating a novel text setting method. We represent key words of documents through â€˜data choralificationâ€™, being a polyphonic singing equivalent of word clouds. Using documents about sexual assault, which was the theme of a six-movement choral work, of which the choralification was one movement, frequent words had their word frequencies mapped to audio frequencies in the normal choir vocal range, after removing stop words. Words were allocated to vocal parts and sung simultaneously. The impact of composition decisions is discussed. Automated choralification of data using synthetic voices challenges the current definition of sonification."
"Global-scale remote sensing of mine areas and analysis of factors explaining their extent Rock; Acid Mine Drainage; Tailings Mines are composed of features like open cut pits, water storage ponds, milling infrastructure, waste rock dumps, and tailings storage facilities that are often associated with impacts to surrounding areas. The size and location of mine features can be determined from satellite imagery, but to date a systematic analysis of these features across commodities and countries has not been conducted. We created detailed maps of 295 mines producing copper, gold, silver, platinum group elements, molybdenum, lead-zinc, nickel, uranium or diamonds, representing the dominant share of global production of these commodities. The mapping entailed the delineation and classification of 3,736 open pits, waste rock dumps, water ponds, tailings storage facilities, heap leach pads, milling infrastructure and other features, totalling ~3,633 km2. Collectively, our maps highlight that mine areas can be highly heterogeneous in composition and diverse in form, reflecting variations in underlying geology, commodities produced, topography and mining methods. Our study therefore emphasises that distinguishing between specific mine features in satellite imagery may foster more refined assessments of mine-related impacts. We also compiled detailed annual data on the operational characteristics of 129 mines to show via regression analysis that the sum area of a mine's features is mainly explained by its cumulative production volume (cross-validated R2 of 0.73). This suggests that the extent of future mine areas can be estimated with reasonable certainty based on expected total production volume. Our research may inform environmental impact assessments of new mining proposals, or provide land use data for life cycle analyses of mined products."
"Boiler Safety in South Asia Steel Tanks; Inspection; Boilers The fast-growing economic development in developing countries led by South Asia creates a large demand for the use of boilers/pressure vessels. Non-compliance of standards, poor design, operations, maintenance, shortage of skilled personnel, education and safety awareness are responsible for the increasing boiler fatalities in South Asia. This paper highlights issues related high boiler explosion fatalities in developing nations especially in South Asia. Some actions that can significantly increase the boiler safety and reduce fatalities are also elaborated."
"Using PVA and Attapulgite for the Stabilization of Clayey Soil Compressive Strength; Dry Density; Limes Considering that, in the context of the ecological restoration of a large number of exposed rock slopes, it is difficult for existing artificial soil to meet the requirements of mechanical properties and ecological construction at the same time, this paper investigates the stabilization benefits of polyvinyl acetate and attapulgite-treated clayey soil through a series of laboratory experiments. To study the effectiveness of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and attapulgite as soil stabilizer, a triaxial strength test, an evaporation test and a vegetation growth test were carried out on improved soil with different amounts of PVA content (0, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%) and attapulgite replacement (0, 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8%). The results show that the single and composite materials of polyvinyl acetate and attapulgite can increase the peak deviator stress of the sample. The addition of polyvinyl acetate can improve the soil strength by increasing the cohesion of the sample; the addition of attapulgite improves the soil strength mainly by increasing the internal friction angle of the sample. The strength of the composite is greatly improved by increasing the cohesion and internal friction angle of the sample at the same time. The effect of adding materials increased significantly with increasing curing age. Moreover, polyvinyl acetate and attapulgite improve the soil water retention of the soil by improving the water-holding capacity, so that the soil can still ensure the good growth of vegetation under long-term drought conditions. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicated that the PVA and attapulgite of soil affect the strength characteristics of soil specimens by the reaction of PVA and water, which changes the structure of the soil and, by the interweaving of attapulgite soil particles, acts as the skeleton of the aggregate. Overall, PVA and attapulgite can effectively increase clayey soil stability by improving the cohesive force and internal friction angle of clayey soil."
"Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 354 Diseases and Injuries for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2017: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 National Burden; Territories; Disease Background: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) includes a comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. Methods: We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68 781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. Findings: Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3Â·9% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3Â·1-4Â·6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7Â·2% (6Â·0-8Â·4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421-723) to 853 million (642-1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7Â·9% (6Â·6-9Â·2) for males and 6Â·5% (5Â·4-7Â·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95% UI 2782-3252] per 100 000 in males vs 1400 [1279-1524] per 100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082-3583] vs 2336 [2154-2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943-3630] vs 5643 [5057-6302]). Interpretation: Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury."
"Recent advances in CO2 hydrogenation to value-added products — Current challenges and future directions Catalyst; Hydrogenation; Aurichalcite Climate change, global warming, fossil fuel depletion and rising fuel prices have created great incentives to seek alternative fuel production technologies. CO2 transformation to value-added products using renewable H2 has proven to be an emerging solution to enable this goal. In this regard, three different promising processes, namely methane, methanol and hydrocarbon synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation are thoroughly discussed. In addition, the influential factors affecting process efficiencies such as catalyst design and mechanistic insight, operating conditions as well as reactor types are investigated, with key pathways that dictate catalyst activity and selectivity of the most promising materials described. Furthermore, a brief overview of the reactor configuration and its crucial role in the improving process viability is analyzed. Accordingly, fixed-bed, fluidized-bed, annular and spherical reactors along with H2O/H2 perm-selective membrane reactors are disscussed for hydrocarbon production. In addition, different reactor configurations are compared to assess the best one that is adjustable depending on the reaction mechanism. Consequently, a corrugated-wall dual-type membrane reactor is proposed as an emerging alternative for CO2 hydrogenation to value-added products."
"Electrochemical Evaluation of the Stability and Capacity of r-GO-Wrapped Copper Antimony Chalcogenide Anode for Li-Ion battery Carbon; Tin Dioxide; Ion Storage Poor cycling stability and capacity fade are primary concerns for next-generation anode materials for Li-ion batteries. In non-carbonaceous anode materials, alloying with Li leads to volume increase that affects practical applications, and increase in particle size, amorphization and reduced conductivity can all lead to a loss of performance. In this work, binary antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) and ternary copper antimony sulfide (CuSbS2) are synthesized by a convenient solvothermal process. These materials are used to study the Li-active/inactive concept, by incorporating Cu into Sb2S3 forming CuSbS2 wherein Cu is Li inactive whereas Sb is Li active. By direct comparison, we have shown that incorporating Cu into binary antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) resulting into ternary copper antimony sulfide (CuSbS2) addresses the problem of poor conductivity and capacity loss, as Cu provides conductivity leading to enhanced charge transfer and prevents Sb particle aggregation while charge-discharge by exhibiting spectator or diluent ion effect. The better performance of CuSbS2 is associated with the better Li+ ion diffusion in the CuSbS2 (D=8.97Ã—10âˆ’15 cm2 sâˆ’1) compared to Sb2S3 (D=2.76Ã—10âˆ’15 cm2 sâˆ’1) and lower series resistance of CuSbS2 (R=4.70Ã—105 Î©) compared to Sb2S3 (R=5.81Ã—108 Î©). We have also investigated the composite with the addition of rGO. The CuSbS2-rGO delivered a reversible capacity of 672 mAh gâˆ’1 after 1000 cycles at 200 mA gâˆ’1 which has shown best performance."
"Ethically minded consumer behaviour in Vietnam: An analysis of cultural values, personal values, attitudinal factors and demographics Consumer Ethics; Moral Intensity; Morality Purpose: Consumer ethics in Asia has attracted attention from marketing scholars and practitioners. Ethical beliefs and judgements have been predominantly investigated within this area. Recent research argues for consumer ethics to be measured in terms of behaviours rather than attitudinal judgements, due to a potential pitfall of attitudinal scales, which researchers often refer to as an attitudeâ€“behaviour gap. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to examine the dimensions of ethically minded consumer behaviour (EMCB) in an Asian emerging market context. Design/methodology/approach: A survey of 316 Vietnamese consumers was conducted to investigate their ethically minded behaviours. Findings: The SEM analyses reveal a significant impact of long-term orientation on EMCB, whereas spirituality has no impact. Collectivism, attitude to ethically minded consumption and subjective norms are found to influence the dimensions of EMCB. Age, income and job levels have effects on EMCB dimensions, but gender, surprisingly, has no effect. Practical implications: The study can be beneficial to businesses and policy makers in Vietnam or any similar Asian markets, especially in encouraging people to engage with ethical consumption. Furthermore, it provides practitioners in Vietnam with a measurement instrument that can be used to profile and segment consumers. Originality/value: This is among the first studies utilising and examining EMCB, especially in Vietnam where research into consumer ethics is scant. It contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a greater understanding of the impact of personal characteristics and cultural environment on consumer ethics, being measured by the EMCB scale which has taken into account the consumption choices. Furthermore, this study adds further validation to the EMCB scale."
"The Australian carbon tax: corporate perceptions, responses and motivations Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: This study aims to explore how large Australian companies in emission intensive industries perceived the introduction of the Carbon Tax as an approach to carbon emissions regulation and as a tool for accountability. It also investigates the influence of perceptions of the new tax on the internal carbon emissions management practices and the motivations for such actions. Design/methodology/approach: This study draws on transaction cost theory and legitimacy theory to address corporate perceptions, responses and motivations in relation to the Carbon Tax. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 senior managers directly responsible for the carbon emissions management of their companies. Findings: The study found that the Carbon Tax, viewed by the high-emitting companies as a heavy financial burden, had a significant influence on moderating organisational legitimacy seeking behaviours. It is evident that the transaction cost issues in the form of the carbon pricing requirement has led to a change of focus to â€œmanagementâ€ rather than merely reporting to external stakeholders. This influenced companies to change their behaviour with the potential to internalise previous externalities of carbon pollution. Research limitations/implications: This research highlights that a pricing signal in emissions regulations is essential in conjunction with external pressures to effectively stimulate emissions management actions in companies. It extends our understanding of legitimacy theory by suggesting that a mandatory pricing mechanism as explained by transaction cost economics has the potential to lead to actual changes in corporate behaviour through a focus on management rather than reporting. Practical implications: The study highlights the important elements of any effective emissions policy designed to encourage strong emissions management actions from companies. Based on the findings of the study, it is evident that the Carbon Tax was a very effective mechanism in driving emission management actions, despite the general perception that any deficiencies associated with such a price mechanism could have a negative effect on the economy. Social implications: Climate change is a critical issue for the modern society and this study discussed a short-lived policy tool in the Australian context that had the potential to change corporate behaviour in relation to carbon management. Originality/value: This study is among the very few studies that have examined the influence of the Carbon Tax on internal emissions management practices of companies, and therefore, provides a unique dataset of corporate responses to the Carbon Tax. Given the short time frame that the Carbon Tax was in operation, the study enhances our understanding of the influence the Carbon Tax had on companies responsible for high greenhouse gas emissions."
"Porcupine quill: Buckling resistance analysis and design for 3d printing Keratins; Feathers; Wool Recently, materials with lightweight and high mechanical strength are on high demand. These characteristics are exceptionally important in various field, particularly in structural engineering. Nature offers inspirational solutions which are beyond our expectations. Plants and animals are made of well-architectured structures and materials to protect themselves against harsh environments and enemies, same goes to porcupines. Under emergency condition, porcupine protects itself by jabbing the quills into the skin of the assailant. The long and sharp cylindrical quill possesses outstanding mechanical properties including lightweight and high buckling resistance. At present, research focusing on the mechanical analysis of porcupine quills in the literature is limited. The extraordinary features of the quills are known but not fully-explored. At different cross-sections within a same quill, different microstructural patterns are observed. To better understand the buckling property of porcupine quill, compression test is performed. This paper is aimed to microstructurally investigate the mechanism of buckling resistance in porcupine quill at different cross-sections. Theoretical analysis is performed via buckling theory proposed in the literature. Based on the understanding of this biological structure, a design approach is proposed to mimic the porcupine quills for 3D printing."
"Redressing gendered undervaluation in New Zealand aged care: Institutions, activism and coalitions Political Representation; Quotas; Parliament This article explores the apparent conundrum of how, with minimal employment standards and limited equal pay laws, New Zealand managed to significantly redress the gendered undervaluation of low-paid aged care work. To draw out the pathways to these reforms, we focus on the long-term strategic coalitions that underpinned them. We examine, in particular, the activism of a diverse range of policy actors â€“ unions, employers, industrial and human rights bodies and civil society groups, which together have worked to â€˜undoâ€™ the limitations of equal pay and employment regulation. Our findings point to the benefits of strategic collaboration between policy actors in New Zealand and an approach which recognises the intersection of unequal pay with other gendered dimensions of disadvantage in aged care work. Different strategies used over time by diverse actors helped them overcome inadequate industrial and equal pay infrastructure to realise meaningful increases in hourly rates of pay, buttressed by improved working time arrangements and provision for career progression. We conclude by highlighting some lessons for institutional and policy actors in other national settings drawn from the New Zealand collaborative approach to equal pay in care work."
"Nano/microplastics: Fragmentation, interaction with co-existing pollutants and their removal from wastewater using membrane processes Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Nano: and microplastic (NP/MP) is one of the most challenging types of micropollutants, coming from either direct release or degradation of plastic items into ecosystems. NP/MP can adsorb hazardous pollutants (such as heavy metals and pharmaceutical compounds) and pathogens onto their surface that are consumed by humans, animals, and aquatic living organisms. This paper presents the interaction of NP/MP with other pollutants in the water environment and mechanisms involved to enable the ultimate fate of NP/MP as well as the effectiveness of metal-organic frame (MOF)-based membrane over conventional membrane processes for NP/MP removal. It is found that conventional membranes could remove MPs when their size is usually more than 1000 nm, but they are ineffective in removing NPs. These NPs have potentially greater health impacts due to their greater surface area. MOF-based membrane could effectively remove both NP and MP due to its large porous structure, high adsorption capacity, and low density. This paper also discusses some challenges associated with MOF-based membranes for NP/MP removal. Finally, we conclude a specific MOF-based ultrafiltration membrane (ED-MIL-101 (Cr)) that can potentially remove both negative and positive charged NP/MP from wastewater by electrostatic attraction and repulsion force with efficient water permeability."
"Effects of salinity on the biological performance of anaerobic membrane bioreactor Activated Sludge; Batch Reactors; Salinity The performance of anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) was evaluated treating synthetic wastewater with various concentrations of NaCl (0â€“40 g/L), as well as the recovery phase. The effluent COD removal efficiency decreased from 96.4% to 95.0%, 91.4%, 86.7% and 77.7% with stepwise increasing of salt concentration from 0 to 5, 10, 20 and 40 g NaCl/L, respectively, then gradually increased to 94.1% during the recovery phase. Additionally, the significant changes in the content and composition of soluble microbial products (SMP) and extracellular polymer substance (EPS) were obtained under higher salt stress. GC-MS analyses were carried out for the effluent, and some new types of compounds, such as Dodecane, Undecane, and Ethyl Acetate, were found during salt exposure phases. The characterization of the microbial community was also investigated based on the analysis of genomic 16S rDNA, revealing the increasing salinity (5â€“40 g NaCl/L) could reduce the diversity of sludge microbial community in AnMBR. Meanwhile, the significant effects on the composition of dominate phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Chloroflexi) were found during the salt exposure phase."
"Assessment of social-economic risk of Chinese dual land use system using fuzzy AHP China; Dewatering; Confined Aquifer The Chinese dual land use system (DLUS) has played a crucial role in the industrialization of China since 1950s. However, this dual system caused/causes obstacles in urban development under the new market economic conditions. This paper presents an approach to assess the social-economic risks during urban development in China by integrating the strategic environment assessment (SEA) principle into the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. In the proposed approach, SEA principles are set as the influencing factors in AHP. Fuzzy AHP is used to assess the relative importance degree of the six principles in SEA. To illustrate the application procedure of the proposed approach, a building collapse incident inWenzhou is used as a case for the risk analysis. The assessment results show that the index of the manage system has the greatest importance to social-economic risk. The principle of sustainable development (A) and monitoring measures (E) have more importance than the other principles in SEA. It can be concluded that the DLUS in the market management of China may be responsible for building collapse incidents in rural areas. It is suggested that the principles of sustainable development and monitoring measures in SEA should be strictly implemented during urbanization, and it is recommended that the government establish a unified management system and ensure the effective implementation of sustainable urbanization."
"Using metabolomics to assess the sub-lethal effects of zinc and boscalid on an estuarine polychaete worm over time Homarine; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Daphnia Magna Introduction: Zinc is a heavy metal commonly detected in urban estuaries around Australia. Boscalid is a fungicide found in estuaries, both in water and sediment, it enters the system predominantly through agricultural run-off. Zinc is persistent while boscalid breaks down, with a half-life of 108 days. Both contaminants are widely distributed and their effects on ecosystems are not well understood. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the metabolite changes in Simplisetia aequisetis (an estuarine polychaete) following laboratory exposure to a sub-lethal concentration of zinc or boscalid over a 2-week period. Methods: Individuals were collected at six time points over a 2-week period. Whole polychaete metabolites were extracted and quantified using a multi-platform approach. Polar metabolites were detected using a semi-targeted GCâ€“MS analysis and amine containing compounds were analysed using a targeted LCâ€“MS analysis. Total lipid energy content was also analysed for Simplisetia aequisetis. Results: The pathways that responded to zinc and boscalid exposure were alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism (AAG); glycine, serine and threonine metabolism (GST) and metabolites associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Results showed that changes in total abundance of some metabolites could be detected as early as 24-h exposure. Changes were detected in the metabolites before commonly used total lipid energy assays identified effects. Conclusion: A multi-platform approach provided a holistic overview of the metabolomic response to contaminants in polychaetes. This approach shows promise to be used in biomonitoring programs to provide early diagnostic indicators of contamination and exposure."
"Constraints to the uptake of solar home systems in Ho Chi Minh City and some proposals for improvement Energy; Energy Poverty; Fuelwood This study examines the constraints to the uptake of Solar Home Systems (SHS) in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam. SHS are photovoltaic systems which generate electricity for residential properties. The limited numbers of SHS installed in HCMC are mostly on-grid systems with backup batteries to supply electricity to residential properties during evenings and/or power cuts. Semi-structured interviews with SHS installers, manufacturers and users, plus government agencies and technical experts identify pricing, regulatory issues and the cost of systems as major constraints. Cost-benefit analysis is then used to estimate the financial rates of return and payback periods for three representative SHS. Introducing net metering with a price equal to the proposed tariff of VND 3250/kWh would generate financial rates of return of over 7.5% and shorten the payback periods for the two larger systems from more than 30 years to 12 or 13 years. Smaller off-grid kits are already competitive with small, stand-alone diesel or gasoline generators. In the next five years, reforms to Vietnam's electricity market can be expected to green the energy mix and make SHS more finally attractive. SHS therefore represent a promising technology for HCMC in the future."
"The making of a climate emergency response: Examining the attributes of climate emergency plans Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Climate emergency declarations are amongst the strongest statement from governments in the face of global warming. At least 1217 local governments have so far declared a climate emergency; however, on a national government level, only seven such declarations have been made, most of which were in 2019. The exponential rise of local governments declaring a climate emergency is significant, and developing an understanding of how these responses are operationalised is critical. Previous studies indicate that local government practitioners conceptualise climate change as a complex emergency but tend to suggest â€˜business as usualâ€™ responses, unfit to deal with this complexity. Since these governments around the world have declared climate emergencies, it is unknown if the newly released climate emergency plans still tend to suggest such â€˜business as usualâ€™ response approaches or if we are now seeing the making of a more complex response to the complex threat of climate change. In this paper, we review two local governments' climate emergency plans: Auckland (New Zealand) and the City of Darebin (Melbourne, Australia). Our research develops a conceptual understanding of climate emergency mode (10 critical key attributes are articulated) and we reveal through the review of our two cases that this understanding is embedded in policy documents to varying degrees but give little explicit attention to processes of prioritisation or economic mobilisation. This research contributes to an initial understanding of a climate emergency mode in governance systems and provides a way forward from business as normal to a complex emergency response for climate change."
"Ventilating aged-care center based on solar chimney: Design and theoretical analysis Hot Temperature; Solar Chimneys; Natural Ventilation Natural ventilation is considered the first suggestion for COVID-19 prevention in buildings by the World Health Organization (WHO). Solar chimney's viability in aged care centers or similar facilities was analyzed numerically and theoretically. A new solar chimney design was proposed to reduce the cross-infection risk of COVID-19 based on an airflow path through window, ceiling vent, attic, and then chimney cavity. Solar chimney performance, quantified by the natural ventilation rate, presented power function with window area, ceiling vent area, cavity height, and solar radiation. The ceiling vent is suggested to be closer to the corridor to enhance the performance and ventilation coverage of the room. A cavity gap of 1.0 m is recommended to balance the ventilation performance and construction cost. A theoretical model was also developed for aged care centers with multiple rooms and a joint attic. Its predictions obey reasonably well with the numerical results. Solar chimney's viability in aged care center is confirmed as a 7.22 air change per hour (ACH) ventilation can be achieved even under a low solar radiation intensity of 200 W/m2, where its performance fulfills the minimal ventilation requirement (i.e., 6 ACH) suggested by the WHO for airborne infection isolation rooms. This study offers a new design and a guideline for the future implementation of solar chimney in aged care centers or similar facilities."
"Flow and flood: mobilities, life in roads and abiotic actors of the (m)ôtô-cene Automobility; Psychological Practice; Non-places Traffic in mega-urban Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) demonstrates the transformative powers of vehicles and transport infrastructures. Like eddies of a river, traffic flows are abiotic actors â€“ other-than-human physical phenomena that influence how traffic makes its way. But the liquid sense of flow in Vietnamese imaginings has unique qualities that challenge singular conceptualisations of the Anthropocene. Moving beyond human-centredness, this paper re-imagines traffic of metropolitan HCMC as the (m)Ã´tÃ´-cene. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, I examine transformations of diurnal patterns of banal journey-making where infrastructure routinely fails and ask how abiotic actors shape ways of inhabiting the Anthropocene and living with roads."
"Direct contact membrane distillation for effective concentration of perfluoroalkyl substances – Impact of surface fouling and material stability Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ecotoxic amphiphilic compounds containing alkyl-fluorinated chains terminated with weak acid moieties, and hence difficult to be degraded or removed from water sources. Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) was used for concentrating and removing of perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) compounds from model contaminated water using commercially available poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) membranes. The membranes were characterised for surface morphology, roughness, contact angle and pore size distribution before and after the DCMD test to investigate and evaluate membrane fouling. During the DCMD test performed for 6 h using 10 ppm PFPeA solution, the membrane exhibited progressive increased flux (from 17 to 43 kg mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1) and decreased PFPeA rejection (from 85 to 58%), as the feed temperature was increased from 50 to 70 Â°C. Further, the feed/retentate side showed a 1.8, 2.1 and 2.8-fold increase in PFPeA concentration tested at feed temperatures 50, 60, and 70 Â°C, respectively. The permeate side contained less than 1 ppm of PFPeA revealing that the PFPeA moved across the PTFE membrane during DCMD, which is attributed to progressive surface diffusion over time. This study opens a new route to concentrate and remove amphiphilic molecules, such as PFAS, from source points, relevant to landfill leachates or surface waters. The study also points at gaps in materials science and surface engineering to be tackled to deal with PFAS compounds efficiently."
"Advanced microbial fuel cell for waste water treatment—a review Bioenergy; Regenerative Fuel Cells; Bioelectricity Petroleum, coal, and natural gas reservoir were depleting continuously due to an increase in industrialization, which enforced study to identify alternative sources. The next option is the renewable resources which are most important for energy purpose coupled with environmental problem reduction. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have become a promising approach to generate cleaner and more sustainable electrical energy. The involvement of various disciplines had been contributing to enhancing the performance of the MFCs. This review covers the performance of MFC along with different wastewater as a substrate in terms of treatment efficiencies as well as for energy generation. Apart from this, effect of various parameters and use of different nanomaterials for performance of MFC were also studied. From the current study, it proves that the use of microbial fuel cell along with the use of nanomaterials could be the waste and energy-related problem-solving approach. MFC could be better in performances based on optimized process parameters for handling any wastewater from industrial process."
"Investigation of thermal performance of concrete incorporating different types of recycled coarse aggregates Concrete Aggregates; Construction and Demolition Waste; Mechanical Properties To adopt sustainability in the construction industry, various nations around the globe are focusing on the utilization of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). The thermal performance of RAC incorporating different types of recycled coarse aggregates (RCA) is unexplored in the current literature. In this study, the thermal performance of RAC incorporating RCA treated through different techniques including accelerated carbonation, soaking in lime with accelerated carbonation, soaking in acetic acid, soaking in acetic acid with rubbing, and soaking in acetic acid with accelerated carbonation is explored. Furthermore, dry density, compressive strength, water absorption, the volume of permeable pores, porosity, and pore size distribution of all the concrete specimens are also investigated. The thermal conductivity of RAC specimens is observed 27% lower than natural aggregate concrete (NAC) specimens. An increase in thermal conductivity is observed for RAC specimens incorporating treated RCA than RAC specimens with untreated RCA. However, the thermal conductivity values of RAC specimens with treated RCA are still observed lower than NAC specimens. A relationship is also developed by regression analysis of the test database to predict the thermal conductivity of RAC. The proposed relation can effectively predict the thermal conductivity of RAC incorporating untreated and treated RCA leading towards the development of guidelines for sustainable construction."
"Wet-bulb Temperature and Sea-level Rise in the United Arab Emirates–Planning Responses Qatar; United Arab Emirates; Gulf Region Increased heat stress and sea-level rise, associated with climate change could threaten the viability of some cities by the latter part of this century. This paper reviews urban development patterns in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, and concludes these cities are highly vulnerable to elevated wet-bulb temperatures and sea level rise. This is predominantly due to the focus of development along the Gulf coastline, where these issues are concentrated. In response, this paper ventures regional planning responses to adapt to these threats through decentralising populations to inland areas."
"Impacts of Climate Change on Rainfall Trends Under RCP Scenarios in Johor, Malaysia Climate Change; CMIP; Regional Climate Changes in the spatial and temporal rainfall pattern affected by the climate change need to be investigated as its significant characteristics are often used for managing water resources. In this study, the impacts of climate change on rainfall variability in Johor was investigated by using General Circulation Model (GCM) on the availability of daily simulation for three representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios, RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for interval year of Î”2030, Î”2050 and Î”2080. In addition, the annual future rainfall trend for the first interval year of Î”2030 was also made. Daily rainfall series from eight (8) stations in Johor, Malaysia capturing 30 years period (1988-2017) with less than 10% missing data were chosen. The annual mean rainfall for RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 was predicted increase by 17.5%, 18.1% and 18.3%, respectively as compared to historical data. Moreover, the Mann-Kendall (MK) test was used to detect the trend and resulted in no trend for RCP 2.6. Even so, RCP 4.5 showed a significant upward trend in Muar and Kota Tinggi, and for RCP 8.5, all regions were detected to have an upwards trend except for Pontian and Kluang. In general, the concentration of greenhouse gases from RCP 8.5 gave the highest rainfall in future"
"Sustainable polymers from recycled waste plastics and their virgin counterparts as bitumen modifiers: A comprehensive review Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens The failure of bituminous pavements takes place due to heavy traffic loads and weatherrelated conditions, such as moisture, temperature, and UV radiation. To overcome or minimize such failures, a great effort has been put in recent years to enhance the material properties of bitumen, ultimately improving field performance and increasing the pavement service life. Polymer modification is considered one of the most suitable and by far the most popular approach. Elastomers, chemically functionalised thermoplastics and plastomers * (* Note: Notwithstanding the fact that in Polymer Science the word â€˜plastomerâ€™ indicates a polymer with the simultaneous behaviour of an elastomer and plastics (thermoplastics), this paper uses the term â€˜plastomerâ€™ to indicate a thermoplastic polymer as it is more commonly found in Civil and Pavement Engineering.) are the most commonly used polymers for bitumen modification. Plastomers provide several advantages and are commonly acknowledged to improve high-temperature stiffness, although some of them are more prone to phase separation and consequent storage instability. Nowadays, due to the recent push for recycling, many road authorities are looking at the use of recycled plastics in roads. Hence, some of the available plastomers-in pellet, flakes, or powder form-are coming from materials recycling facilities rather than chemical companies. This review article describes the details of using plastomers as bitumen modifiers-with a specific focus on recycled plastics-and how these can potentially be used to enhance bitumen performance and the road durability. Chemical modifiers for improving the compatibility between plastomers and bitumen are also addressed in this review. Plastomers, either individual or in combination of two or three polymers, are found to offer great stiffness at high temperature. Different polymers including HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE, MDPE, PP, PS, PET, EMA, and EVA have been successfully employed for bitumen modification. However, each of them has its own merit and demerit as thoroughly discussed in the paper. The recent push in using recycled materials in roads has brought new light to the use of virgin and recycled plastomers for bitumen modification as a low-cost and somehow environmental beneficial solution for roads and pavements."
"Covalent-cross-linked plasmene nanosheets Ligands; Nonmarket Good; Self-Assembly Thiol-polystyrene (SH-PS)-capped plasmonic nanoparticles can be fabricated into free-standing, one-nanoparticle-thick superlattice sheets (termed plasmene) based on physical entanglement between ligands, which, however, suffer from irreversible dissociation in organic solvents. To address this issue, we introduce coumarin-based photo-cross-linkable moieties to the SH-PS ligands to stabilize gold nanoparticles. Once cross-linked, the obtained plasmene nanosheets consisting of chemically locked nanoparticles can well maintain structural integrity in organic solvents. Particularly, arising from ligand-swelling-induced enlargement of the interparticle spacing, these plasmene nanosheets show significant optical responses to various solvents in a specific as well as reversible manner, which may offer an excellent material for solvent sensing and dynamic plasmonic display."
"Cementless building materials made from recycled plastic and sand/glass: a review and road map for the future Rubber Waste; Mechanical Properties; Tires Plastic and glass can be sorted using machines and recycled into new plastic and glass as opposed to producing them from raw materials. However, contaminated plastic and glass, as well as certain types of plastic and glass, cannot be recycled using traditional methods and must be disposed of in a landfill. Researchers have been looking into these and have tried a variety of solutions to convert this waste into functional products. The development of composite construction materials based on these two materials was identified as a worthy solution. On the other hand, carbon dioxide is emitted during the cement manufacturing process and the use of that cement in the production of construction materials contributes 7% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, plastic sand/glass composite is environmentally friendly in two ways. It reduces landfill while also replacing the equivalent concrete product, lowering CO2 emissions. This paper examines the literature on the development of such materials, including technology, challenges, quality, and properties. The development of a glass/sand composite to use as a material in the commercial scale production of building materials such as roof and pavement tiles is described based on studies that are available."
"The PAH body burdens and biomarkers of wild mussels in Port Phillip Bay, Australia and their food safety implications China; Source Apportionment; Indeno(1,2,3-Cd)Pyrene Wild Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were collected from 10 coastal sites of Port Phillip Bay, Australia, and 16 types of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in their bodies were measured. Also, mussels from 4 of the 10 sites were sampled and the activities of Metallothioneins (MTs), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and Ethoxyresorufin -o- deethylase (EROD) in the gills were tested. The results demonstrated spatial variation of different PAHs in mussels, which differed from trace metal accumulations to mussels reported in previous studies. Besides, the results of SOD, GST, and EROD showed highly similar features among mussels from all the sites while the results of MTs appeared to be different. The estimation of possible excessive cancer risks caused by wild mussel consumption using the results in this study demonstrated that the PAHs in wild mussels in Port Phillip Bay is a moderate concern for consumers."
"Performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine powered by macadamia and grapeseed biodiesels Fuel Tests; Diesel Engines; Biofuel Biodiesel is an alternative, eco-friendly and renewable source of energy. It can be produced from a wide range of feedstocks which can be grown in marginal land use. It has drawn more attention to the researchers. In this study, the oil extraction, biodiesel conversion, and physiochemical properties of Macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia) and Grapeseed (Vitis vinifera) biodiesels are presented. The experimental investigation of diesel engine performance, emissions and combustion characteristics were conducted using B5 (5% biodiesel and 95% diesel by volume) and B10 (10% biodiesel and 90% diesel by volume) blends. The engine performance parameters, such as brake power (BP), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) have been investigated in this experiment. The emission parameters, for example, carbon monoxide (CO), the ratio of CO2/CO, nitrogen oxide (NOx), hydrocarbon (HC), particulate matter (PM) have been measured during the experiment. Finally, the combustion parameters such as cylinder pressure (CP) were recorded, and heat release rate (HRR) was analysed and compared with that of diesel fuel. The study revealed that the Macadamia biodiesel performed better than Grapeseed biodiesel and behaved closely to that of diesel fuel. A significant reduction of engine emissions was found in the case of Macadamia biodiesel with a minimal reduction of engine performance. Further analysis of energy, exergy and tribological characteristics of the Macadamia biodiesel is recommended for assessing its feasibility for commercial application."
"Opportunities for biodiversity conservation as cities adapt to climate change Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Cities are investing billions of dollars in climate change adaptation to combat the effects of sea-level rise, temperature extremes, increasingly intense storm events, flooding and water scarcity. Natural ecosystems have enormous potential to contribute to city resilience, and so, actions that rely on this approach could sustain considerable co-benefits for biodiversity. In this paper we identify the prevalence of key themes of human adaptation response that could have biodiversity conservation outcomes in cities. We then quantify the area of impact for actions that identify specific targets for greening or green infrastructure that could involve natural ecosystems, providing an indicator of potential co-benefits to biodiversity. We then extrapolate to explore the total area of land that could benefit from catchment management approaches, the area of waterways that could benefit from nature-based improvement of these spaces, and finally the number of threatened species that could benefit across these cities. From 80 city climate adaptation plans analysed, we found that urban greening plays a key role in most adaptation strategies, and represents an enormous opportunity for biodiversity conservation, given the diversity of animal and plant species in urban environments. We show that the ranges of at least 270 threatened species overlap with the area covered by just 58 city adaptation plans, including watershed catchments totalling over 28 million km2. However, an analysis of 80 city adaptation plans (of a total 151 found globally) shows that this opportunity is being missed. Just 18% of the plans assessed contained specific intentions to promote biodiversity. We highlight this missed opportunity, as climate adaptation actions undertaken by cities represent an enormous incipient opportunity for nature conservation. Finally, we encourage planners and city governments to incorporate biological conservation into climate adaption plans, for the mutual benefit of urban societies and their biodiversity."
"What can surveillance data and risk factor research contribute to a public health approach to preventing child sexual abuse? Child Sexual Abuse; Sexual Crime; Female Sex Offender The aim of this article was to consider how population-level surveillance data and risk factor research might be applied to a public health approach to preventing child sexual abuse. The focus is on the collection of data in relation to ethnicity. By drawing from the four principles approach to ethical decision making developed by Beauchamp and Childress, the expected benefits of data collection are weighed against possible harms to individuals and communities. It concludes that the identification of high-risk groups can inform prioritisation of resources, and the development of context-specific and culturally sensitive child sexual abuse prevention and intervention programmes. However, it is crucial to explain why child sexual abuse is more prevalent in some ethnic communities than others. Explanations about causes can reduce the potential for stigmatisation and marginalisation of individuals and communities, as well as challenge widely held myths about biological determinism and inability to change."
"Overview Causal Layered Analysis; Education; Foresight The world is experiencing profound and wide-ranging change, due to a transition to, and impact of, the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) with its associated demands, new and emerging technologies, increasing focus on green growth, including challenges associated with climate change, urbanization, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. These changes have created major disruptions to the economic and social environment in many countries worldwide, which have important implications for education and schooling, and for the advancement of learning societies. This is no doubt an age of disruption. This introductory chapter provides an overview of six key themes covered in this volume. Using an evidence-based approach, this chapter describes the six parts of the volume that explore implications of these disruptions on education at all levels, and on advancement of learning societies. The book also outlines key issues, concerns, and prospects confronting education and training, and the challenges faced by countries, regardless of their level of economic or social development. An area of special emphasis is the disruptive impact of COVID-19 on powering learning societies."
"Integrated optical power equalizer based on a dual- polarization micro-ring resonator Microresonators; Solitons; Comb and Wattles We demonstrate an optical power equalizer based on a dual-polarization micro-ring resonator. By controlling the light polarization, a large loss tunable range from -29.3 dB to 30 dB of the equalizer is experimentally achieved."
"Binding parameters and molecular dynamics of β-lactoglobulin-vanillic acid complexation as a function of pH – Part A: Acidic pH Astringency; Proline Rich Protein; Antioxidant Protein-phenolic compound interactions are commonly investigated with inappropriate linear equations for the analysis of binding strength and stoichiometry. This work utilises more appropriate protocols for the investigation of molecular interactions between vanillic acid and Î²-lactoglobulin at pH 2.4, where the protein predominately exists as a monomer. Non-linear binding and Job plot analysis were conducted on fluorescence data to effectively determine the interaction's dissociation constant (KD, 2.93 Ã— 10âˆ’5 M) and stoichiometry (1:1). Furthermore, spectroscopic techniques revealed statistically significant alterations to the conformational characteristics of Î²-lactoglobulin upon complexation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations support a 1:1 interaction stoichiometry and reveal that the stabilisation of vanillic acid was dynamic in nature but mainly supported by four Ï€-alkyl interactions and one hydrogen bond, located within the Î²-barrel of the monomer. Water molecules, which are generally not accounted for in MD simulation analysis, were shown to be an important factor in the ligand stabilization via bridging interactions."
"Citizen scientists track a charismatic carnivore: Mapping the spread and impact of the South African Mantis (Miomantidae, Miomantis caffra) in Australia Citizen Scientists; Monitoring; Volunteers The recent integration of citizen science with modern technology has greatly increased its applications and has allowed more people than ever to contribute to research across all areas of science. In particular, citizen science has been instrumental in the detection and monitoring of novel introduced species across the globe. This study provides the first records of Miomantis caffra Saussure, 1871, the South African Mantis, from the Australian mainland and uses records from four different citizen science and social media platforms in conjunction with museum records to track the spread of the species through the country. A total of 153 wild mantises and oothecae were observed across four states and territories (New South Wales, Norfolk Island, Victoria, and Western Australia) between 2009 and 2021. The large number of observations of the species in Victoria and the more recent isolated observations in other states and territories suggest that the species initially arrived in Geelong via oothecae attached to plants or equipment, likely from the invasive population in New Zealand. From there it established and spread outwards to Melbourne and eventually to other states and territories, both naturally and with the aid of human transport. We also provide a comparison of M. caffra to similar native mantises, specifically Pseudomantis albofimbriata (StÃ¥l, 1860), and comment on the potential impact and further spread of the species within Australia. Finally, we reiterate the many benefits of engaging directly with citizen scientists in biodiversity research and comment on the decision to include them in all levels of this research investigation."
"The benefits of being understood: The role of ethnic identity confirmation in knowledge acquisition by expatriates Self-initiated Expatriates; International Assignments; Expatriates In this article, we propose that the concept of ethnic identity confirmation (EIC), the level of agreement between how expatriates view the importance of their own ethnic identity and how local employees view the importance of expatriates' ethnic identity, can explain why expatriates who are ethnically similar to host-country employees are sometimes less effective than expected when working overseas. Multinationals often choose ethnically similar expatriates for international assignments, assuming these expatriates can more effectively acquire knowledge from local employees. Thus, understanding the specific challenges that endanger the realization of this potential is crucial. Our survey, administered to a sample of 128 expatriateâ€“local employee dyads working in China, reveals that both ethnically similar and ethnically different expatriates acquire more local knowledge when EIC is high. However, the association between ethnic (dis)similarity and knowledge acquisition is direct for ethnically different expatriates, whereas for ethnically similar expatriates it is indirect via their perception of local employees' trustworthiness. We discuss this study's important implications and provide recommendations for multinationals on how to provide tailored support to expatriates who face different identity challenges."
"Early-Life exposure to rainfall shocks and gender gaps in employment: Findings from Vietnam Child Labor; Family Characteristic; School Attendance Despite the achievement of gender equity in education in many developing countries, a gender gap still exists with respect to formal employment. Through inhibiting women's empowerment and reducing the supply and productivity of labour, this gap results in poorer development outcomes. This paper examines whether exogenous rainfall shocks experienced in early life explain variations in future formal sector employment outcomes. It does so for Vietnam, a country that is highly vulnerable to rainfall shocks. The paper employs data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey and rainfall data from the Gridded Monthly Time Series Dataset. Findings suggest that rainfall shocks experienced early in life have a long temporal reach by reducing the probability of formal sector employment for women but not for men. Other findings indicate that the gendered impact of rainfall shocks operates through differential effects on educational attainment and that shocks occurring in the first and second year of life are most important."
"Review of drivers and threats to coastal groundwater quality in China Nutrients; Submarines; Radon With rapid socio-economic development, China's coastal areas are among the fastest growing and most economically dynamic regions in the world. Under the influence of climate change and human activities, protecting the quality of coastal groundwater has emerged as one of the key environmental and resource management issues for these areas. This paper reviews (for the first time) groundwater quality data for the coastal basins of China, where over 600 million people live, focussing on key inorganic indicators/pollutants; groundwater salinity, nitrate, fluoride, and arsenic. These pollutants present major water quality issues and are also valuable as indicators of wider processes and influences impacting coastal groundwater quality â€“ e.g. saltwater intrusion, agricultural pollution and release of geo-genic contaminants. We discuss the major drivers causing water quality problems in different regions and assess future trajectories and challenges for controlling changes in coastal groundwater quality in China. Multiple processes, including modern and palaeo seawater/brine migration, groundwater pumping for agricultural irrigation, pollution from agrochemical application, rapid development of aquaculture, urban growth, and water transfer projects, may all be responsible (to different degrees) for changes observed in coastal groundwater quality, and associated long-term health and ecological effects. We discuss implications for sustainable coastal aquifer management in China, arguing that groundwater monitoring and contamination control measures require urgent improvement. The evolution and treatment of coastal groundwater quality problems in China will serve as an important warning and example for other countries facing similar pressures, due to climate change, coastal development, and intensification of anthropogenic activity in coming decades."
"The politics of migration and mobility in the art World: Transnational baltic artistic practices across europe Transnationalism; Human Migration; Dual Citizenship While Eastern European migration is predominantly seen as one-way, permanent, for economic reasons, and as going bilaterally from East to West Europe, this book investigates alternative patterns of migration and mobility across Europe. This original new book explores how visual artists take part in regular cross-border mobilities, onward migrations and transnational communications across Europe for work and the effects of this on their feelings of home and belonging. It assesses how far there is a culture of mobility amongst visual artists from the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, for whom a combination of onward migration and regular cross-border mobilities is a necessity for career progression. This is due to the â€˜glass ceilingâ€™ in the Baltic States with regard to a lack of local art markets, few dealers buying art and governments not providing enough funding. How then do artists from the Baltic States get onto the global art market in the face of such barriers? This is a particularly important question, as these artists come from a region where migration, mobilities and cross-cultural exchanges were not freely available during the Soviet Union. This transdisciplinary investigation into visual artistsâ€™ working practices, ways of moving and placing dwellings addresses this issue. Mobile working practices have an impact on artistsâ€™ feelings of home and belonging, which can be seen in their artworks that compare different cultures. This is a result of their particular combination of onward migration and regular mobilities, the multiple flows in and out of the home cities and the workings of the global art market within which these artists are operating. Nevertheless, these movements are determined by the forces of the global art world, whereby a particular politics of migration and mobility is experienced by artists from the Baltic States wanting to â€˜make itâ€™ in the global art world. With its focus on Baltic artists and their mobilities, the scope and space explored is the whole of Europe and the mobilities explored in this text are crucially enabled by the freedom of movement in the European Union. The book is multidisciplinary and at the intersection of art, geographic mobility and creative practice. It combines visual cultures and social sciences in order to answer questions more thoroughly as well as to contextualise an analysis of artworks in a conversation with the artists themselves. This topic is current, with the situation of the â€˜refugee crisisâ€™ and Brexit that has created a culture of anti-immigration and resurgence in anti-Eastern European sentiment in government, mainstream media and society. The book discusses the implications of these complex itineraries on the conventional sociological notions of home, mobility and diaspora. The author argues that artists form a â€˜diaspora of practiceâ€™ rather than of ethnicity, their homes are multiple as are the directions of their settlement. Primary appeal will be to artists and art professionals; scholars working and researching on mobilities and migration issues; those working on the concepts of belonging and home; sociologists; anthropologists; those in the fields of cultural studies and European Union studies."
"Introduction: Early childhood education policy reforms in Australia and China Comparative Education; China; UNESCO This chapter introduces early childhood education, policies and reforms and a collaborative partnership to explore comparative perspectives in early childhood across Australia and China. In this book we draw on the research literature to develop a picture of early childhood education in the two countries and to provide background and context. Early childhood education has been identified by governments and policy makers as a strategy to counter inequality and support economic growth. Continuous reform, in terms of access, quality of the services provided and the training required by the workforce are a focus of policy development and also the subject of the research projects described in this book. The value of comparative studies is discussed and the usefulness of exploring early childhood education and care initiatives across borders contemplated. Debates in Australia and China have been introduced in order to reflect on the influence of internationalisation and globalisation in shaping educational policy, practice and relationships. This introduction describes the organisation of the book, comments on the nuanced nature of comparative studies when knowledge is shared across borders and touches on some of the questions that arise from the research projects reported upon."
"Characterization of nasal irrigation flow from a squeeze bottle using computational fluid dynamics Nasal Lavage; Sodium Chloride; Hypertonic Solutions Background: Nasal saline irrigation has become standard of care in various sinonasal conditions, including allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and in the postoperative patient. Evidence regarding the mechanisms and dynamics of liquid flow through the sinonasal cavity remains limited due to inadequate experimental models (cadaveric, 3-dimensional [3D] printed, imaging of labeled dyes and radioisotopes). We aimed to develop a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of nasal irrigation to demonstrate sinonasal surface coverage, residence times across the mucosal surfaces, and shearing force of irrigation. Methods: A nasal cavity geometry derived from high-resolution paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) scans of a healthy, unoperated, 25-year-old patient was created. CFD analysis was performed to assess the distribution of nasal irrigation from a tapered nozzle bottle at a forward head-tilt position of 45 degrees with a 2-second burst at 35 mL/second. Results: The model demonstrates nasal irrigation from ipsilateral to contralateral with precise measures of velocity, pressure, wall shear stress, and mapping of surface coverage and residence times at specific locations and times. The nasal cavity experiences almost complete coverage of irrigation, while overflow from the nasal cavity facilitates moderate coverage of the ipsilateral maxillary (40%) and anterior ethmoid sinuses (30%). Negligible coverage of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses was noted. Conclusion: Detailed physical mechanisms of liquid irrigation injected from a commonly used squeeze bottle were shown. Ipsilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinus penetration are primarily due to overflow rather than direct jet entry, confirming the recommendation of larger volumes of irrigation to â€œfloodâ€ the sinus ostia."
"Data-driven model-free adaptive control of z-source inverters Electric Potential; DC-DC Converter; Inductors The universal paradigm shift towards green energy has accelerated the development of modern algorithms and technologies, among them converters such as Z-Source Inverters (ZSI) are playing an important role. ZSIs are single-stage inverters which are capable of performing both buck and boost operations through an impedance network that enables the shoot-through state. Despite all advantages, these inverters are associated with the non-minimum phase feature imposing heavy restrictions on their closed-loop response. Moreover, uncertainties such as parameter perturbation, unmodeled dynamics, and load disturbances may degrade their performance or even lead to instability, especially when model-based controllers are applied. To tackle these issues, a data-driven model-free adaptive controller is proposed in this paper which guarantees stability and the desired performance of the inverter in the presence of uncertainties. It performs the control action in two steps: First, a model of the system is updated using the current input and output signals of the system. Based on this updated model, the control action is re-tuned to achieve the desired performance. The convergence and stability of the proposed control system are proved in the Lyapunov sense. Experiments corroborate the effectiveness and superiority of the presented method over model-based controllers including PI, state feedback, and optimal robust linear quadratic integral controllers in terms of various metrics."
"Effects of solution matrix on moringa oleifera seeds and banana peel in eliminating heavy metals, fluoride and turbidity from synthetic groundwater samples Biosorption; Isotherms; Aqueous Solution Plant-based biomass has become an environmental-friendly water purification agent in replacing conventional chemicals. In the previous study, Moringa oleifera (MO) seeds and banana peel (BP) have been selected based on their moderate to high effectiveness in removing lead, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, turbidity, and fluoride from synthetic groundwater samples. This study was aimed to investigate further the effects of solution matrix on the biomass effectiveness. Batch experiments were conducted by using coagulation technique and the initial pH of the solutions was controlled to be at pH 7. The results demonstrate that the removal rates for most of the pollutants in multi-contaminant solution were higher compared to the single-contaminant solution. The reason could be due to electrostatic or mutual interactions between contaminants present in the solution thus improved the removal rates of those contaminants. In terms of performance, combination of MO and BP either dosed in mixing (MO+BP) or sequential manner (i.e., MOâ†’BP or BPâ†’MO) are seen can improve the treatment performance by single biomass for most of the target contaminants. The findings are significantly important to understand the effects and removal behavior of the biomass in different solution matrix."
"Hybrid AI-based Dynamic Re-routing Method for Dense Low-Altitude Air Traffic Operations Helicopter; A-6 Aircraft; Airspace In this paper, we propose a rerouting method based on hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for managing Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) traffic during their cruise and approach phases. The adopted approach capitalizes upon FourDimensional Trajectory (4DT) functionalities, supporting an uncertainty-resilient and flexible strategic deconfliction framework to improve the operational efficiency and security of Demand-Capacity Balancing (DCB) services. The objective is to accommodate future UAM and other autonomous vehicle-based business models by safely implementing traffic management in dense low-altitude airspace around cities and suburbs. The proposed UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system uses metaheuristic algorithm, especially the Tabu-search algorithm, to determine a global optimised rerouting solution. The calculated solutions can be continuously used as labelled data to train and optimise a machine learning process for real-time decision making, greatly improving the computational performance of intelligent UTM systems."
"Impacts of thermo-optical properties on the seasonal operation of thermochromic smart window Vanadium Dioxide; Metal-Insulator Transition; Thin Films A type of smart window using thermochromic glazing (TCG) is a promising technology for green buildings owing to the self-regulating feature and low-maintenance need. Its most important feature, thermo-optical properties that regulate the blockage of solar heat, is directly linked to the variation of surface temperatures. However, challenges from the inhomogeneity of thermo-optical properties, the coupled solar radiation and natural convection, and varying outdoor conditions all seriously hinder the understanding of its mechanism. In this paper, a validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model achieves the simulation of inhomogeneous tinting of TCG by defining the thermo-optical properties of each finite volume according to the surface temperature. Solar radiation and natural convection at outdoor, indoor and the cavity are solved to reflect glazing temperature more accurately. The case studies compared six different switching temperatures in the range of 20 âˆ¼ 42.5 Â°C with a transition gradient of 10 Â°C. Averaged meteorological data for both summer and winter, sunny days and cloudy days are selected to present realistic climate impacts. The result reveals the overall saving in transmitted solar radiation in summer and heating penalties in winter. It suggests the best switching temperatures for each climate condition. With the seasonal operation, the highest saving in solar heat gain is 20.9% when adopting a switching temperature of 25â€“35 Â°C, while the lowest saving can be negative, meaning TCG is not suitable for those climate zones. The proposed evaluation criteria help to quantify the applicability of TCG with the input of the summer/winter day ratio and sunny/cloudy ratio. The best region to apply TCG is where summer days are longer and winter solar radiation is significantly lower. The in-depth understanding of this temperature-sensitive process benefits the optimization of TCG in buildings, especially for its seasonal operation needs."
"Realtime predictive patrolling and routing with mobility and emergency calls data Human Mobility; Taxis; Points Of Interest A well-planned patrol route plays a crucial role in increasing public security. Most of the existing studies designed the patrol route in a static manner. Situations when rerouting of patrol path are required due to the emergencies, e.g., an accident or ongoing homicide, are not considered. In this paper, we formulate the crime patrol routing problem jointly with dynamic crime event prediction, utilising crowdsourced check-in and real-time emergency call data. The extensive experiment on real-world datasets verifies the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic crime patrol route using different evaluation metrics."
"Traffic congestion relief associated with public transport: state-of-the-art Bus Transportation; Motor Vehicles; Travel Time Public transport (PT) influences the urban road system in many ways, including traffic congestion, environment, society, safety and land use impacts. While there are many studies focusing on the benefits of PT, research on congestion impacts, a fundamental component of any analysis of transport performance, associated with PT has received little attention. This paper aims to review the traffic congestion impacts of PT and how they are assessed. Traffic congestion is most commonly related to vehicle travel; yet, the real measure of congestion in transport systems is people travel. This paper looks at the appropriateness of existing traffic congestion measures and how suitable they are for measuring the impact of an existing PT system in the short-term. The literature review indicates that most studies relating to the congestion impacts of PT have used vehicle-based congestion measures. People-based measures may be more appropriate in assessing PT impacts. The paper also proposes a new framework for looking at the short-term effects of an existing PT system on traffic congestion. It suggests a few areas where further work can be undertaken to improve our understanding of traffic congestion incorporating PT such as exploring the mode shift from PT to car, estimating network-wide PT congestion creation impacts and determining the net congestion impact of PT."

"When gambling fails: Caring-with urban communities at the local scale Pathological Gambling; Sports Betting; Casino â€˜Careâ€™ is a keyword for cities and citizens in the 21st century. This paper draws on Emma Power's (2019) notion of â€˜caring-withâ€™ as an ethical and analytical guide for caring action and relational community capacity-building around gambling at the local scale. The focus of analysis is the approval of electronic gaming machines or EGMs colloquially known as â€˜the Pokiesâ€™, with particular reference to the Australian context and the experience of Castlemaine - a small town in the south-eastern state of Victoria whose citizens successfully appealed an application for further gambling development. The paper highlights how caring-with re-frames community responses to gambling as an assemblage of localized care practices and relations. This includes, but is not limited to, working to develop a culture of care, challenging systemic injustices, and proactive rather than reactive practices of collective care."
"Towards an integrated theoretical framework for understanding women, work and violence in non-metropolitan contexts Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Economics of Scale This paper proposes an integrated theoretical framework for understanding women, work and violence in non-metropolitan contexts. Despite the fact that the relationship between domestic and family violence (DFV) and the workplace is a growing focus of academic research, there remain certain lacunae within the literature. In particular, research that examines DFV and work in tandem is incredibly urban-centric, but also quite descriptive and a-theoretical, as well as quantitative in its methodological approaches. The lack of non-metropolitan research at the nexus of DFV and work is puzzling, given that established scholarship tells us firstly that DFV is more potent and complicated outside of big cities, and secondly that work is also harder to obtain and more complicated. In light of these issues, the current paper serves three distinct functions. Firstly, it operates as a call for the generation of new research that addresses limitations within the academic conversation. Secondly, it argues for the significance of research that illuminates the relationship between work and DFV in non-metropolitan locations; not only to address the existing knowledge gap, but also because the findings generated in these more â€˜extremeâ€™ scenarios may assist us in effectively addressing the DFVâ€“work nexus more broadly. And thirdly, to facilitate the production of rigorous and holistic knowledge at the intersection of work, DFV and non-metropolitan experience, the paper proposes an integrated theoretical framework for understanding women, work and violence in non-metropolitan contexts. Overall, it argues that such an integrated framework would necessarily need to account for the contextual factors of space and place, as well as feminist theory on work, and existing knowledge on both violence against women and the complexities of work in non-metropolitan contexts."
"Tertiary nutrient removal from wastewater by immobilised microalgae: Impact of wastewater nutrient characteristics and hydraulic retention time (HRT) Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Immobilising microalgal cells has been proposed as a process solution to overcome the barriers associated with the implementation of microalgae for wastewater remediation. This work evaluated the performance and remediation mechanisms of immobilised microalgae for continuous wastewater treatment under varying hydraulic retention times (HRT). Three domestic secondary wastewaters with differing concentrations of orthophosphate (PO4-P), ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N) were treated by Scenedesmus obliquus immobilised within 2% calcium alginate. Trials were run in continuous operation at HRTs of 3, 6, 12 and 20 h. Removal rates for PO4-P improved with increasing HRT, with minimum residual concentrations of 0.3â€“3.1 mgÂ·L-1 observed at 3 h and 0.01â€“0.2 mgÂ·L-1 at 20 h. Ammonium remediation was not linked to HRT or NH4+ concentration with minimum residual concentrations of,0.001 mgÂ·L-1. Reduction in NO3-N improved with increasing HRT, with minimum residual concentrations of â‰¤19.3 at 3 h and â‰¤0.4 mgÂ·L-1 at 20 h. Remediation was achieved through a combination of mechanisms including biological uptake and precipitation as a by-product of photosynthesis and nutrient metabolism. As such, immobilised microalgae have been proven to be an effective alternative solution for PO43- and NH4+ remediation of wastewater effluents at HRTs of 6â€“12 h."
"Following #JillMeagher: Collective meaning-making in response to crime events via social media Alcohol Drinking; Patron; Alcohol Policy In the early morning of Saturday 22 September 2012 an Australian woman, Gillian â€˜Jillâ€™ Meagher, was reported missing after spending an evening out with work colleagues in suburban Brunswick (Melbourne, Victoria). Thousands of Australians followed the crime event as it unfolded via the mainstream news and online. On Sunday 23 September, a Facebook group â€˜Help Us Find Jill Meagherâ€™ was created, accumulating 90,000 followers in just four days, while the hashtags #jillmeagher and #meagher were two of the highest trending topics on Twitter across Australia. This article focuses on the social media narrative constructions of this crime: from Jillâ€™s initial disappearance, to the identification of her alleged killer and discovery of her body, through to the street march held in her memory on Sunday 30 September 2012. Through a qualitative analysis of a Twitter dataset comprising over 7000 original tweets, the article explores meta-narratives of sexual victimisation, â€˜riskâ€™ and â€˜safetyâ€™, as well as â€˜digilantismâ€™ and activism that characterised Australian Twitter usersâ€™ responses to this violent crime. In doing so, the article reflects on collective practices of meaning-making in response to public crime events that are enabled in a digital society."
"Implementation of recycling cigarette butts in lightweight bricks and a proposal for ending the littering of cigarette butts in our cities Tobacco; Smoking; Leachates Our cities, parks, beaches, and oceans have been contaminated for many years with millions of tonnes of unsightly and toxic cigarette butts (CBs). This study presents and discusses some of the results of an ongoing study on recycling in fired-clay bricks. Energy savings: the energy value of CBs with remnant tobacco was found to be 16.5 MJ/kg. If just 2.5% of all bricks produced annually worldwide included 1% CB content, all of the CBs currently produced could be recycled in bricks, and it is estimated that global firing energy consumption could be reduced by approximately 20 billion MJ (megajoules). This approximately equates to the power used by one million homes in Victoria, Australia, every year. Bacteriological study: CBs were investigated for the presence of ten common bacteria in two pilot studies. Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected in fresh used CB samples, and Listeria spp. were detected in old used CB samples. All of the CB samples except the dried sample had significant counts of Bacillus spp. Some species of the detected bacteria in this study are pathogenic. Further confirmation and comprehensive microbiological study are needed in this area. The contact of naphthalene balls with CBs had a significant disinfecting effect on Bacillus spp. The implementation procedure for recycling CBs in bricks, odour from Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions in CBs, sterilization methods, CB collection systems, and safety instructions were investigated, and they are discussed. Proposal: when considering the combined risks from many highly toxic chemicals and possible pathogens in cigarette butts, it is proposed that littering of this waste anywhere in cities and the environment be strictly prohibited and that offenders be heavily fined."
"A temporal assessment of microplastics distribution on the beaches of three remote islands of the Yasawa archipelago, Fiji Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter This is the first study that investigated the presence, distribution, and composition of microplastics, MPs (1-5 mm) on beaches in the Yasawa Islands, Fiji. A temporal assessment over three years on six beaches was undertaken to investigate different beach traits on MP abundance. Average MP concentration was 4.5 Â± 11.1 MPsÂ·mâˆ’2 with significantly higher concentrations were found on east-facing beaches than west (p < 0.001), and higher on the storm line compared to the high tide line (p < 0.001). No difference was found between tourist and local beaches (p = 0.21). These results demonstrate the role of current-driven ocean transport of plastic pollution in this part of The South Pacific. ATR FT-IR analysis showed that across all sites 34 % of MPs were polypropylene (PP), 33 % polystyrene (PS), 25 % polyethylene (PE), and 8 % other polymer types. Further studies are needed to assess the potential impacts of MPs on Fiji's coral reefs and marine life."
"Environmental change, urbanisation, and socio-ecological resilience in the Pacific: Community narratives from Port Vila, Vanuatu Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Ecosystem services play a key role in maintaining community resilience and wellbeing; a function increasingly profiled following the publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. However, there is limited understanding of the value of, and threats to, â€˜urbanâ€™ ecosystem services, especially in relation to Small Island Developing States (SIDS). This study uses a bottom-up approach to investigate the provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural benefits of local ecosystems to urban communities in Port Vila, Vanuatu. The project was based on participatory action research carried out for the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) as part of the Pacific Ecosystem-based Adaptation to Climate Change Project. Based on a survey of 821 households, and 10 community workshops, this paper provides a narrative of the terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal ecosystem services salient to the livelihoods of vulnerable urban communities. This narrative is set in the context of rapid urbanisation and climate change, which are increasingly undermining community resilience. These findings stress the urgent need to better understand, and account for, complex socio-ecological relationships when developing adaptation policies and urban development plans, not only in Vanuatu but across Oceania's cities and towns."
"Editorial: Women and leadership in higher education learning and teaching Autoethnography; Grief; Research Personnel In this Special Issue Harvey and Jones state â€œIt is time for women academics to accept the challenge â€“ to rightfully claim their leadershipâ€. We recognise the many women who have challenged the system, and those whose efforts have been thwarted. We encourage women and men to work together to break down the barriers of gender, race, culture, and religion, so that our current and next generation of female academics can rightfully claim their leadership. This Special Issue is an important step to bringing to light these challenges for women and the changes required to grow and support women in leadership in higher education teaching and learning."
"Engaging with uncertainty and ambiguity through participatory 'Adaptive Pathways' approaches: Scoping the literature Robust Decision Making; Climate Change Adaptation; Uncertainty Analysis Climate change adaptation planning demands decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. Adaptive Pathways (AP) planning is receiving increased attention as a method to guide adaptation planning in the face of uncertainties. The approach has been most extensively developed and applied in large, well-funded contexts such as the Thames Barrier and Dutch Delta program. However, the development of AP planning has focused much less on the parallel need for engaging with the challenge of ambiguity - that there are diverse, sometimes contending, knowledges, values, and stakes involved. A more nascent body of work has been exploring ways of engaging with both the uncertainties and ambiguities of adaptation through various participatory approaches to AP planning. This paper sought to synthesise insights from this emerging work. Examining the peer-reviewed and grey literature identified eight cases from four countries across five different policy issues that provided details of how they approached diverse participation. Analysis of this small suite of cases provided some key insights for those seeking to use participatory approaches to AP planning to engage with the inherent uncertainties and (arguably necessary) ambiguities of adaptation. The paper concludes with a call for greater publication of details regarding how participatory approaches to methods such as AP planning have been undertaken not just what was undertaken."
"Naturopathy in Australia: Where are we now? Where are we heading? Complementary and Alternative Medicine; Alternative Medicine; Mind-Body Therapies Naturopathy is the general practice of natural therapies. It emphasizes prevention, treatment, and promotion of optimal health through therapeutic modalities which encourage the self-healing process of the body. Formalized in the 19th century by the hydrotherapy and nature cure movement in Austria and Germany, naturopathy was introduced to Australia at the turn of the 20th century. It became popular since the 1970s due to social and cultural change characterized by the post-modern philosophy, as well as government policies highlighting individual responsibility and freedom of choice. Naturopathy is one of the most popular forms of complementary medicine in Australia today with naturopaths received 4.9 million consultations annually. Naturopathic consultations are sought for a variety of conditions and, in some areas, as a form of primary care, especially by middle-aged women who have a higher education level and a higher annual income. The number of Australian naturopaths was estimated to be over 4000 in 2017 and expects to grow to over 4600 by 2022, although this number is likely to be an underestimation. Australian naturopaths, as a predominantly female profession, work mainly in private clinical practice with nutritional medicine, herbal medicine, homeopathy, as well as massage therapies being the most common modalities used. There are also signs of greater integration with community pharmacies and integrative medicine clinics in major cities. The Bachelor's degree programs in Naturopathy has just become the only accredited entry-level qualification since late 2015. Currently, there are only 5 private colleges offering naturopathic education, a far cry from the 40 over in mid-2000. The profession continues to be self-regulated. There is no barrier of entry to practice and unqualified practitioners of naturopathy can potentially do harm to the public. The registration of naturopaths remains unresolved due to fragmented representation under many professional associations, disunity among the profession, and objections by certain health care lobbyists. There is a dearth of research demonstrating efficacy of the whole practice of naturopathy in Australia, which has directed the government's decision to withdraw it from private health insurance coverage from 2019. Moving forward, the whole system research of naturopathy in Australia will be in focus with the recent establishment of a practice-based research network and an international research consortium. With increasing scrutiny from evidence-based medicine, the present and future challenge to Australian naturopaths is centered on the integration of both scientific and traditional evidence to form the foundation of a person-centered, evidence-informed practice."
"Preferred risk allocation in Egypt’s water sector PPPs China; Build-Operate-Transfer; Risk Allocations As Egypt suffers from water scarcity and limited public funds, increasing investments in unconventional water supply projects through the public-private partnership (PPP) scheme is considered a necessity. Meanwhile, risk allocation is considered critical to the implementation and success of PPPs. This paper captures, presents and discusses the risk allocation preferences for domestic wastewater treatment and Seawater Desalination PPPs in Egypt. Face-to-face structured interviews were conducted with experienced practitioners and a preferred risk allocation scheme was developed using the â€˜majority opinionâ€™ approach. Results were compared to similar findings in China; a mature water sector PPP market. The research findings enable developing an efficient risk allocation framework for water sector PPPs in Egypt in the early stages of project development. The comparative study enables foreign investors to adjust their investment strategies by considering the similarities and differences in Egypt and China."
"Choosing the right nature-based solutions to meet diverse urban challenges Cultural Ecosystem Services; China; Natural Capital Increasing focus on Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in cities has significantly expanded the range of applications in which urban nature is considered useful, as well as the range of NBS available. Traditional parks, gardens and street trees now sit alongside innovative approaches including rooftop pollinator habitats, constructed wetlands and hydroponic green facades, each of which has its own particular challenges and benefits. This variety of solutions introduces an important new decision-making challenge for cities wishing to implement NBS: choosing the right set of specific NBS interventions. Decision support tools such as Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) can help navigate complex decisions, but their application to urban NBS selection decisions has been limited. Current NBS assessment frameworks tend to either give highly aggregated results, or are tailored to only one specific ecosystem service. Here we demonstrate a novel application of MCDA to the practical challenge of selecting a set of NBS to address multiple urban challenges. The MCDA tool developed here was used in seven cities participating in the European Union project â€˜Urban GreenUPâ€™. We describe the development and use of the MCDA tool, and explore how cities used the tool to guide NBS selection. We also evaluate the tool using sensitivity analysis and feedback from users. We find that participating cities are seeking to balance a large number of possible benefits from NBS solutions, and the tool proved useful for navigating the selection decision. Users identified opportunities to improve the tool's usability and clarity. They also noted a key strength of the tool as a prompt for co-production of knowledge and decisions. Collectively, these findings advance the design and application of tools to support complex decisions about selecting NBS to address diverse urban challenges."
"Food Safety Labelling Management in the Green Supply Chain Management: A Direct Observational Study in the Vietnamese Retail Food Sector Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices Maintaining food safety techniques in the supply chain management require special food safety labelling techniques during distribution in the retail food industry. The food products have to be of good quality and labelling inbound, manufacturing, and outbound in the supply chain contributes to this aim. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how food safety labelling is managed in Vietnamâ€™s retail food industry with a special focus on food in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Photography was used in an observational study conducted among five separate retail market chains all located in this city. In which ways are the applications of the developed food safety labelling techniques among three separate retail food markets similar and dissimilar being accounted for? The results show that the packaging and labelling in Big C, Aeon Citimart, and Giant using the symbols of food safety build trust for their customers. The Big C indicates guidelines for VietGAP and green labelling. Aeon Citimart indicates the name of the good, expiration date and instructions for use as well as guidelines for the government factor (VietGAP) to the food safety practices in the Vietnamese food retail sector."
"Control optimization of PV powered electric storage and heat pump water heaters Electricity Demand; Heat Pumps; Energy Domestic rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems are typically installed without energy storage and power generated in excess of the building electric load must be exported to the grid or curtailed. In this paper the use of excess PV electricity for water heating is investigated, with the hot water storage tank acting as a low-cost thermal battery. A 3.6 kWp PV system installed on a domestic house with a 315 L storage hot water heater is analysed. It is shown that advanced control of the water heater is critical to make effective use of local intermittent PV power. Without appropriate controls the excess PV power can only reduce the grid energy consumption of an electric storage water heater by approximately 13%. However, with appropriate control, savings of purchased grid electricity above 80% can be achieved for electric storage water heaters. Similarly, using a heat pump, the consumption of purchased grid electricity for water heating can be reduced by close to 90% by making use of excess PV power. The use of excess PV electricity for water heating purposes can also significantly reduce export PV electricity, thereby also assisting the voltage and frequency stabilisation of the electrical distribution network."
"A review of microalgal biofuels, challenges and future directions Biofuel; Nannochloropsis; Chlorella Sorokiniana Fossil fuels play an absolute dominant role in the global energy mix, followed by biofuels and other energy sources. Fossil fuel dependency is unsustainable due to its finite nature. Moreover, a large amount of greenhouse gas emission is generated by the use of fossil fuels. Biofuels from microalgae have the potential to provide a sustainable and carbon-neutral energy source, complementing the shortfall of fossil fuels and enhancing the mitigation of global warming. One of the notable advantages of biofuels from microalgae is that it does not pose any threat to human or animal food chain and its production can be achieved using barren land, salt water, wastewater and CO2 emitted by thermal power plants. Despite having enormous potential, current production, harvesting and processing techniques of microalgal biomass remain not cost-effective or widely used. Hence, further optimisation of microalgal mass culture, harvesting and processing techniques, and efficient utilisation of by-products are needed to make this carbon-neutral energy source economically viable and sustainable. Coupling microalgae cultivation with wastewater and CO2 from power plants is considered a promising route for the production of bioenergy and bio-based by-products. Significant challenges remain to be addressed to utilise the full potential of third-generation biofuel derived mainly from microalgal biomasses. This chapter presents a brief view of the current progress on microalgal biofuel production, its future directions and challenges."
"Towards Sustainable Environmental Quality: Priority Research Questions for the Australasian Region of Oceania Ethinylestradiol; Endocrine Disruptors; Wastewater Treatment Environmental challenges persist across the world, including the Australasian region of Oceania, where biodiversity hotspots and unique ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef are common. These systems are routinely affected by multiple stressors from anthropogenic activities, and increasingly influenced by global megatrends (e.g., the foodâ€“energyâ€“water nexus, demographic transitions to cities) and climate change. Here we report priority research questions from the Global Horizon Scanning Project, which aimed to identify, prioritize, and advance environmental quality research needs from an Australasian perspective, within a global context. We employed a transparent and inclusive process of soliciting key questions from Australasian members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. Following submission of 78 questions, 20 priority research questions were identified during an expert workshop in Nelson, New Zealand. These research questions covered a range of issues of global relevance, including research needed to more closely integrate ecotoxicology and ecology for the protection of ecosystems, increase flexibility for prioritizing chemical substances currently in commerce, understand the impacts of complex mixtures and multiple stressors, and define environmental quality and ecosystem integrity of temporary waters. Some questions have specific relevance to Australasia, particularly the uncertainties associated with using toxicity data from exotic species to protect unique indigenous species. Several related priority questions deal with the theme of how widely international ecotoxicological data and databases can be applied to regional ecosystems. Other timely questions, which focus on improving predictive chemistry and toxicology tools and techniques, will be important to answer several of the priority questions identified here. Another important question raised was how to protect local cultural and social values and maintain indigenous engagement during problem formulation and identification of ecosystem protection goals. Addressing these questions will be challenging, but doing so promises to advance environmental sustainability in Oceania and globally."
"Sustainable management of groundwater extraction: An Australian perspective on current challenges Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Study region: Australia Study focus: Our incomplete knowledge of groundwater systems and processes imposes barriers in attempting to manage groundwater sustainably. Challenges also arise through complex institutional arrangements and decision-making processes, and the difficulty in involving stakeholders. In some areas, these difficulties have led to water table decline and impacts on groundwater users and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. However, there is potential to improve the sustainable use of groundwater resources through improvements in management practices. We discuss some of the challenges, and present survey results of research, government, and industry professionals across the groundwater sector in Australia. New hydrological insights for the region: The highest-ranked challenge identified in the survey was the difficulty in determining regional-scale volumetric water extraction limits. This is surprising given the criticism in the international literature of volumetric based approaches for groundwater management, and the decreased reliance on this approach in Australia and elsewhere in recent years. Other major challenges are the difficulty in determining and implementing maximum drawdown criteria for groundwater levels, determining water needs of ecosystems, and managing groundwater impacts on surface water. Notwithstanding these gaps in technical understanding and tools and a lack of resources for groundwater studies, improvements in stakeholder communication should enable more effective decision-making and improve compliance with regulations designed to protect groundwater and dependent ecosystems."
"Suitability Prediction and Enhancement of Future Water Supply Systems in Barwon Region in Victoria, Australia Environmental Assessment; Landscape Fragmentation; China Intensive agricultural production accompanied by the climate change impacts in postColonial rural landscapes have continuously increased the demand for water resources and coastal areas, showing an unprecedented water supply crisis. By taking extreme weather conditions and rainfall events for future trends, a resilient water storage facility for the landscape requires the collaborative approach of natural systems and simulation modelling techniques to develop sustainable future scenarios. In this study, an ecological suitability model is used to identify potential sites for the construction of multi-purpose dams. As part of the model structure, multi factors are classified using the patterns of changing landscapes, and then weighted overlay analysis is conducted on a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. Compared to previous studies, this paper derives its principal impact parameters and projections based on historical land cover information. The suitability maps that are generated visually guide the geographical location of the multi-purpose dams and indicate the areas from highly suitable to least suitable, clarifying the possibility of building blue infrastructure alongside the waterways in west-central Barwon. The workflow proposes a resilient water system based on existing land characteristics and measures that future water storage capacity will be a valid increase of approximately 1.5 times. This strategy alleviates water scarcity during the dry season to benefit traditional agricultural activities. Digital calculations are utilized to demonstrate the feasibility of the experimental results, providing a methodology for regulating the distribution and supply of river flows throughout the year while retaining runoff in a hierarchical pattern at precipitation periods."
"Unions and corporate social responsibility in a liberal market context: The case of Ford’s shutdown in Australia European Works Council; Employee Representatives; Trade Unions Within many coordinated market economies, labour unions have demonstrated to be key actors in shaping corporate social responsibility. Researchers have, however, paid surprisingly little attention to the role of unions in shaping corporate social responsibility strategies and responses in liberal market contexts. This article extends the emerging research on unions and corporate social responsibility through a case study which investigates union influences over corporate social responsibility within the liberal market context of Australia. We conceptualise the role of unions in corporate social responsibility in this context through an industrial relations lens with particular reference to collective bargaining. Drawing on qualitative data, the case study examines the Ford Motor Companyâ€™s recent closure of its Australian assembly operations which was hailed by a wide range of stakeholders as an exemplar of â€˜best practiceâ€™ in their assistance of displaced workers. We conclude that, while highly socially responsible, Fordâ€™s actions were far from voluntary but influenced by a combination of union influence and a â€˜subsidisedâ€™ corporate social responsibility, where the state, unable and/or powerless to legislate good corporate social behaviour, chose to financially underwrite its cost to the firm. The study represents one of the first studies to demonstrate how unions shape corporate social responsibility strategies of firms in liberal market contexts and how â€˜subsidisedâ€™ corporate social responsibility becomes an alternative political solution within such a context."

"Elite-level athletes with physical impairments: Barriers and facilitators to sport participation Spinal Cord Injuries; Exercise; Physical Disability Knowledge of the often-complex psycho-social factors that influence sport participation is important to increase the number of individuals with a physical impairment participating in sport, and simultaneously enhancing social inclusion and community engagement. The present study examined the sporting experiences of ten high-performing Australian athletes with a physical impairment from grassroots to elite-level. The interviews were transcribed, and thematic analysis was performed for data synthesis. Drawing on the theory of self-determination and the social model of disability, the results highlighted increases in wellbeing including improved fitness, social interaction and self-confidence. The athletes identified primary school and high school as highly influential environments in establishing their interest in sport, with these settings also considered as fruitful platforms to support an inclusive culture and education on disability and sport amongst the wider community."
"Challenges and enablers of women entrepreneurs’ career advancement in Vietnam’s coffee industry Migrant Workers; Self-Employment; Ethnic Business Purpose: This paper aims to explore the motivational factors and contextual facilitators of female entrepreneurs in Vietnamâ€™s coffee industry and also the barriers facing them. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts the grounded theory approach, using semi-structured in-depth interviews with 31 women entrepreneurs in the coffee industry in the rural Central Highlands of Vietnam. Findings: This study found that necessity-driven factors play an important role in motivating female entrepreneurs to advance their careers. However, these factors may be transformed into the opportunity-driven motives. Furthermore, the findings suggest that Asiaâ€™s collectivism culture and family support significantly affect the success of the women entrepreneurs, although gender inequality is not perceived as a serious constraint in entrepreneurial activities. Research limitations/implications: This study has implications for the literature of women entrepreneurs regarding motivations and contextual influences in agricultural and rural areas of Vietnam. However, the sample size is relatively small which limits the concept generation of the study. For further research, a larger sample size with different business sectors should be considered to generate more explicit findings. Practical implications: The findings from this study can assist the policymakers in developing strategies and governmental policies to support the career advancement of women entrepreneurs and improving gender equality in Vietnam. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature about understanding the motives and the roles of socioeconomic contexts in womenâ€™s entrepreneurial activities in agricultural and rural areas."
"The conceptualization of talent and talent management within the banking sector in southernVietnam Talent Management; Practical Implication; Succession Planning Several recently-developed human resources (HR) management studies found that HR development is associated with key stages of Vietnamâ€™s economic development. Conversely, limited research focused on talent management (TM) in the countryâ€™s context. Those studies mainly investigated the ways of attracting and/or retaining Vietnamese talents without a clear focus on the conceptualization of talent and TM. The aims of the study are to (i) explore the conceptualization of talent and TM in the Vietnamese banking sector and (ii) identify similarities and differences between public (state-owned) and private employers in that sector regarding how they conceptualize talent and TM. The literature review discussed main significant perspectives of talent conceptualization, TM approaches and the overview of TM in the banking sector. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with bank managers at private and public banks to collect qualitative data. Based on the research findings, Vietnamese bank talents are mostly related to two main areas; sales and distribution. Remarkably, bank talent refers to acquired soft skills, learning ability, flexibility and technology adaptability of high performers/potentials rather than to innate abilities. The study revealed notable differences between public and private banks regarding talent and TM conceptualizations. Specifically, talent in the private banking sector is identified by not only results (high performance) but also competency (high potential) whereas in the public sector it is mostly identified by results (high performance). Additionally, public banks consider TM as a key human resources management (HRM) practice while private banks attribute TM to various other activities focusing on talent."
"Pataphysics of finance: An essay of visual epistemology Accounting History; Double-Entry Bookkeeping; Social Responsibility Since the economic crisis of 2008, numerous observers have called into question the way that financial knowledge deals with economic reality. In this challenging context, the time has come to embark on a reflection about the role of finance (and financial knowledge) in our contemporary society. This article contributes to this reflection by expanding the process of research through a pataphysical parody illustrating the imaginary dimension of financial knowledge and its implications for accounting practices. Although this imaginary aspect of financial knowledge is often forgotten in finance, it is nevertheless very important since, as I will explain, it directly shapes the computerization of financial markets and can eliminate the economic referent of accounting signs. These claims will be discussed through the lens of a visual epistemology based on the science of imaginary solutions (pataphysics) to illustrate this imaginary nature of financial models. Discussion of the paradoxical consequences implied by increasing computerized implementation of an imaginary solution will ensue. More generally, this paper proposes, on one hand, an original (and critical) perspective on financial knowledge, and on the other hand, an invitation to discuss and escape (from) the mainstream paradigm for the purpose of promoting pluralism in finance."
"Experimental investigation, techno-economic analysis and environmental impact of bioethanol production from banana stem Transesterification; Catalyst; Rubber Seed Oil Banana stem is being considered as the second largest waste biomass in Malaysia. Therefore, the environmental challenge of managing this huge amount of biomass as well as converting the feedstock into value-added products has spurred the demand for diversified applications to be implemented as a realistic approach. In this study, banana stem waste was experimented for bioethanol generation via hydrolysis and fermentation methods with the presence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) subsequently. Along with the experimental analysis, a realistic pilot scale application of electricity generation from the bioethanol has been designed by HOMER software to demonstrate techno-economic and environmental impact. During sulfuric acid and enzymatic hydrolysis, the highest glucose yield was 5.614 and 40.61 g/L, respectively. During fermentation, the maximum and minimum glucose yield was 62.23 g/L at 12 h and 0.69 g/L at 72 h, respectively. Subsequently, 99.8% pure bioethanol was recovered by a distillation process. Plant modeling simulated operating costs 65,980 US$/y, net production cost 869347 US$ and electricity cost 0.392 US$/kWh. The CO2 emission from bioethanol was 97,161 kg/y and SO2 emission was 513 kg/y which is much lower than diesel emission. The overall bioethanol production from banana stem and application of electricity generation presented the approach economically favorable and environmentally benign."
"Bringing PBL to philippines's higher education: How much are teachers geared for the transition from traditional to PBL approach? Human Psychology; Comprehensible Input; EFL Teaching A teacher's teaching philosophy is the Northern star for directing their practices. Different teachers have their own views of effective routes for their students' academic achievement and thus follow different teaching approaches in delivering courses. Project-based learning (PBL) is constantly gaining popularity in computing and engineering education, especially in Western education systems. However, this approach is still preliminary in the Philippines, and the transition from the traditional to PBL is still challenging for educators of this region, where most of the teaching is still very much teacher-centered and lecture-based. This study explores the compatibility and mismatches between Computing and Engineering teachers' teaching philosophies and principles of PBL approach. The teaching philosophies are investigated through the two lenses of Behaviorism and Constructivism. The participants are non-PBL practitioners from different universities and colleges in the Philippines who have the desire to deliver PBL in Computing and Engineering courses for the first time. The study is conducted with mixed methods utilizing a survey followed by an in-depth interview, which cover the participants' (1) belief of learners, (2) curriculum flexibility, (3) teaching-learning activities, (4) teachers' roles and (5) assessment in comparison with the commonalities of PBL approach. The survey's data analyzed in SPSS showed that the participants leaned more on the side of constructivism in their belief of teaching and learning; however, the analysis of interviews in NVivo revealed different degrees the teachers sticked to Behaviorism or Constructivism as regards teacher's role, learning style, and assessment in different parts of their teaching."
"Sustainable and renewable bio-based natural fibres and its application for 3d printed concrete: A review Mechanical Properties; Sisal; Coir The concept of sustainability and the utilization of renewable bio-based sources have gained prominent attention in the construction industry. Material selection in construction plays a significant role in design and manufacturing process of sustainable building construction. Several studies are being carried out worldwide to investigate the potential use of natural fibres as reinforcement in concrete with its noticeable environmental benefits and mechanical properties. 3D printed concrete (3DPC) is another emerging technology, which has been under-developed for the past decade. The integration of reinforcement is one of the major challenges in the application of this new technology in real-life scenario. Presently, artificial fibres have been used as a reinforcement material for this special printable concrete mixture. However, natural fibre composites have received significant attention by many 3DPC constructions due to their lightweight energy conservation and environmentally friendly nature. These benchmarking characteristics unlock the wider area of natural fibres into the composite sector and challenge the substitution of artificial fibres. Hence, this paper presents a comprehensive review on the current practice and advantages of natural fibres in conventional concrete construction. Subsequently, with a view to the future efficient 3DPC construction, the potentials of natural fibres such as eco-friendly, higher impact, thermal, structural, and fire performance over the artificial fibres were highlighted, and their applicability in 3DPC as composites was recommended."
"On the Feasibility of Machine Learning Models for Customer Spending Prediction Problem Customer Churn; Sales; Customer Relationship Management Over the last few years, FinTech (Financial Technology) companies have played a significant role in supporting e-commerce processes and transactions. For individual users, more convenient payment methods were invented to help them purchase more easily. For businesses, itâ€™s now a lot easier to understand customers than ever, especially in knowing how they spend their money. In fact, the capability of predicting customer spending power over a period of time is a crucial task for marketers in making strategic decisions about advertising. However, it is not trivial to build such an automatic prediction system due to the numerous models and metrics available combined with the ad-hoc nature of personal purchases. In this paper, as the first step in tackling the above-mentioned problem, we explored the feasibility of applying different machine learning models and metrics to predict customer spending under different contexts. In particular, we applied Beta Geometric/Negative Binomial distribution (BG/NBD), Gamma-gamma, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to train and predict customer spending. Experimenting with anonymized real-world data supplied by one of the biggest payment providers in Vietnam provided us with valuable insights into the suitability of each model. The result of this research can serve as a foundation for more in-depth work on the same problem in the future."
"An analytical view on STEM education and outcomes: Examples of the social gap and gender disparity in Vietnam Birth Order; Siblings; Only Child United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goal 4, namely Quality Education, has highlighted major challenges for all nations to ensure inclusive and equitable quality access to education, facilities for children and young adults. The SDG4 is even more important for developing nations as receiving proper education or vocational training, especially in science and technology, means a foundational step in improving other aspects of their citizensâ€™ lives. However, the extant scientific literature about STEM education still lacks focus on developing countries, even more in rural areas. Using a dataset of 4967 observations of junior high school students from a rural area in a transition economy, the article employed the Bayesian approach to identify the association between gender, socio-economic status, and studentsâ€™ STEM academic achievements, which were measured by the average score of their most recent 45-minute standard school tests in STEM subjects: Maths, Physics, Chemistry (and Biology where applicable). The results reported that gender had little association with STEM academic achievements. However, female students appeared to have achieved better results than their male counterparts when their parents have non-manual jobs. Families with better economic status, parents with a high level of education, or non-manual jobs were associated with better study results. Also, students with zero or more than two siblings were correlated with lower study results than those with only one sibling. These results provided important implications for policymakers to provide women with opportunities for better education and maintain family size so the parents can provide their resources to each child equally."
"A Framework of Facilitators and Barriers to Career Adaptability: Migrant Hotel Workers During COVID-19 Career Adaptability; College Students; Social Cognitive Career Theory We examine internal and external factors that build or thwart the career adaptability resources of migrant hotel workers. Drawing on qualitative data at two points in time over a 12-month period during COVID-19, results show that while some migrant workers changed roles and exited hotels, for most, job changes were a shorter-term, separation phenomenon, with migrants transitioning back to their employer within a year. Psychological, social, and human capital resources facilitated career adaptability, while psychoemotional support from managers and peers fostered the confidence of temporary migrants, and facilitated positive affect, which was integral to their openness to exploring alternate hospitality careers. Inhibitors to career adaptability included a lack of agency among temporary migrants, and career entrenchment of mid-career permanent migrants. Our model provides a fine-grained, holistic understanding of the antecedents of career adaptability, enriching career construction theory by clarifying the contexts that drive career adaptability in the evolving, COVID-19 context."
"The effect of innovation and leadership on performance in China and Vietnam Personnel; Innovative Behavior; Creative Performance To be competitive, firms have focused their resources on innovation. The success of innovation, however, depends on several factors. One of these factors is the capacity and ability of firmsâ€™ leaders. This study aimed to examine the relationship between leadership, innovation and organizational performance in two socialist countries, China and Vietnam. Four hypotheses were proposed to test the direct and indirect relationships. 334 SMEs responded to the survey that revealed that SMEs leaders who practised behaviours that associated with design leadership fostered firmsâ€™ ability to be innovative and in turn, affected the organizational performance outcomes. Discussion and implication are also provided."
"Solar Energy Driven Membrane Desalination: Experimental Heat Transfer Analysis Distillation; Direct Contact; Membrane In the direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) system, the temperature polarization due to boundary layer formation limits the system performance. This study presents the experimental results and heat transfer analysis of a DCMD module coupled with a salinity gradient solar pond (SGSP) under three different flow channel configurations. In the first case, the feed and permeate channels were both empty, while in the next two cases, the feed and permeate channels were filled with a porous spacer material. Two different spacer geometries are examined: 1.5 mm thick with a filament angle of 65Â°, and 2 mm thick with a filament angle of 90Â°. The study considers only the heat transfer due to conduction by replacing the hydrophobic membrane normally used in a DCMD module with a thin polypropylene sheet so that no mass transfer can occur between the feed and permeate channels. The Reynolds number for all three configurations was found to be between 1000 and 2000, indicating the flow regime was laminar. The flow rate through both the feed and permeate sides was the same, and experiments were conducted for flow rates of 5 L/min and 3 L/min. It has been found that the highest overall heat transfer coefficient was obtained with the spacer of 2 mm thickness and filament angle of 90Â°."
"Less Is More: Rejecting Unreliable Reviews for Product Question Answering Conformal; Conformal Prediction; Informational Efficiency Promptly and accurately answering questions on products is important for e-commerce applications. Manually answering product questions (e.g. on community question answering platforms) results in slow response and does not scale. Recent studies show that product reviews are a good source for real-time, automatic product question answering (PQA). In the literature, PQA is formulated as a retrieval problem with the goal to search for the most relevant reviews to answer a given product question. In this paper, we focus on the issue of answerability and answer reliability for PQA using reviews. Our investigation is based on the intuition that many questions may not be answerable with a finite set of reviews. When a question is not answerable, a system should return nil answers rather than providing a list of irrelevant reviews, which can have significant negative impact on user experience. Moreover, for answerable questions, only the most relevant reviews that answer the question should be included in the result. We propose a conformal prediction based framework to improve the reliability of PQA systems, where we reject unreliable answers so that the returned results are more concise and accurate at answering the product question, including returning nil answers for unanswerable questions. Experiments on a widely used Amazon dataset show encouraging results of our proposed framework. More broadly, our results demonstrate a novel and effective application of conformal methods to a retrieval task."
"Synergetic influence of F-MWCNTS on polyvinylpyrrolidone sodium alginate composite membrane for reverse osmosis Polyethersulfone; Membrane; Ultrafiltration In this study, novel composite membrane of functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (F-MWCNTs) polyvinyl pyrrolidine (PVP) and sodium alginate (Na-Alg) with unique characteristics were synthesized for the application of reverse osmosis (RO) desalination. The MWCNTs in different amounts were systematically and uniformly dispersed in PVP/Na-Alg polymer matrix during the synthesis of membranes by dissolution casting method. The effect of F-MWCNTs content in the performance of the composite membrane was investigated for RO desalination process compared to PVP/Na-Alg blended membrane. The spectral studies were carried out by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (chemical bonding) and scanning electron microscopy (surface morphology). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of membranes also recommended that composite membrane with the highest content of F-MWCNT has more excellent thermal stability compared to PVP/Na-Alg blended membrane and other modified membrane samples. The most striking experimental results show that the incorporation of F-MWCNTs improved the general RO performance of the composite membranes. The modified composite membrane surface became rough as compared to the PVP/Na-Alg blend membrane surface. The PVP/Na-Alg blended membrane shows a maximum permeation flux of 5.5 L/m2h and high-water content. This experimental analysis also presented that tethered F-MWCNTs/PVP/Na-Alg polymer matrix membrane, with stronger F-MWCNTs/polymer matrix interactions, enhanced the composite membrane's salt rejection performance by 85.4% for the highest content of F-MWCNTs. Therefore, it can be concluded that all the membrane samples presented excellent capacity to resist the growth of gram-negative E. coli bacteria."

"Dimensional fidelity and mechanical analysis of 3D printed polymer composites Fused Deposition Modeling; Mechanical Properties; 3D Printers Additive manufacturing's ability in producing complex and intrinsic parts within a short time has attracted interest in both industries and academia. Among various techniques available in the market, material jetting stands out due to its multi-material fabrication. This feature is inevitably favorable in fabricating soft robotics and 4D printed parts. However, there is still a lack of information regarding its geometrical accuracy and mechanical properties. The present work showcased the capability of material jetting in fabricating micro- to macro-scale 3D printing parts. Geometrical resolution is reasonable with a feature size larger than 500 Âµm.Meanwhile, the mechanical performance of the multi-material composites revealed that the inclusion of hard particles within the soft matrix strengthened the part. The strength of the 3D printed composites varies with the type of hard particles within the soft matrix. On the contrary, soft particles within the rigid matrix serve as a crack initiation site."
"Monitoring Victoria’s public forests: implementation of the Victorian Forest Monitoring Program Wildfire; Possums; Tree Cavities A new strategic inventory across all publicly managed forests has been installed in Victoria. For the preceding two decades, Victoriaâ€™s forest inventory has been compiled from various data sources from across the state, an approach that doesnâ€™t allow information about the nature and rate of changes to the resource to be estimated, or for projections or forecasts to be made. To address these limitations, the Victorian Forest Monitoring Program (VFMP) was established, to monitor Victoriaâ€™s progress in meeting a commitment towards sustainable forest management, and to satisfy requirements for state and national reporting. The purpose of the new program is to â€˜assess and monitor the extent, state and sustainable development of Victoriaâ€™s public forests in a timely and accurate manner.â€™ The VFMP consists of a plot-based system of permanent observational units located on a state-wide grid. A combination of ground-based and aerial photo plots and remotely sensed data are used to capture a set of basic attributes that are used to derive indicators of sustainability. To meet the monitoring needs a remeasurement framework has been developed to guide the change estimation procedures. The program was designed and implemented between 2009 and 2015 and used to generate data and information for the most recent Victoriaâ€™s State of the Forest Report. The first annual change estimate is due to be completed in 2017. A summary of implementation and proposed maintenance is presented and discussed in this paper."
"Omnidirectional Hydrogen Generation Based on a Flexible Black Gold Nanotube Array Hot Electrons; Plasmons; Titanium Dioxide Solar-driven hydrogen generation is emerging as an economical and sustainable means of producing renewable energy. However, current photocatalysts for hydrogen generation are mostly powder-based or rigid-substrate-supported, which suffer from limitations, such as difficulties in catalyst regeneration or poor omnidirectional light-harvesting. Here, we report a two-dimensional (2D) flexible photocatalyst based on elastomer-supported black gold nanotube (GNT) arrays with conformal CdS coating and Pt decoration. The highly porous GNT arrays display a strong light-trapping effect, leading to near-complete absorption over almost the entire range of the solar spectrum. In addition, they offer high surface-to-volume ratios promoting efficient photocatalytic reactions. These structural features result in high H2 generation efficiencies. Importantly, our elastomer-supported photocatalyst displays comparable photocatalytic activity even when being mechanically deformed, including bending, stretching, and twisting. We further designed a three-dimensional (3D) tree-like flexible photocatalytic system to mimic Nature's photosynthesis, which demonstrated omnidirectional H2 generation. We believe our strategy represents a promising route in designing next-generation solar-to-fuel systems that rival natural plants."
"Fault-ride-through performance improvement of a PMSG based wind energy systems via coordinated control of STATCOM Asynchronous Generators; Wind Power; Fault Current Limiters This paper presents a coordinated control which combines pitch angle of a wind turbine, flux control of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and reactive power control of grid to enhance the low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability of PMSG based variable speed wind energy conversion system (WECS). The design process of controller parameters and the stability of proposed control strategy have been analysed. In this strategy, pitch angle controller is modified to adjust the pitch for power smoothing as well as LVRT during variable wind speed and grid fault respectively. Flux weakening controller is used to reduce the flux linkages of PMSG by supplying negative field regulating current to reduce the DC link overvoltage during grid voltage dips. Additionally, static compensator (STATCOM) is used to provide reactive power support during grid fault. Extensive simulations of proposed method have been carried out under different cases. The performance of the proposed controller is validated by time series simulation. The results are compared with Braking chopper (BC) based conventional control for verification."
"Flexible employment policies, temporal control and health promoting practices: A qualitative study in two Australian worksites Work-Family Conflict; Work-Life Balance; Personnel For four decades, theories of job demand-control have proposed that higher occupational status groups have lower health risks due to the stress accompanying jobs featuring high demands but high control. This research examines whether Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) can improve the health prospects of a range of workers by giving greater control over work time arrangements. Our setting is Australia, where FWAs were introduced in 2009. In line with these early studies alongside studies of work-life balance, we expected to observe that workers with access to control over daily work times could better control the activities outside of work that influence chronic disease. Using a practice sociology approach, we compared the accounts of twenty-eight workers in blue and white collar industries with differing degrees of work time flexibility. The findings do not contradict early theories describing occupational differences of job demand-control dynamics and their relationship to health risks. However, this study suggests that a) time demands and strains have increased for a broad sweep of workers since the 1980s, b) the greater control of higher occupational status groups has been eroded by the high performance movement, which has attracted less scrutiny than FWAs, and c) more workers are forced to adapt their daily lives, including their approach to health, to accommodate their job demands. Job insecurity further impedes preventative health practices adoption. What might appear to be worker-controlled flexibility can-under the pressures of job insecurity and performance expectations without time limits-transform into health-eroding unpredictability. The answer however is not greater flexibility in the absence of limits on the well-documented precursors of work stress: long hours, job insecurity and intensity-related exhaustion. While there have been welcome developments in job demand-control-health conceptualizations, they typically ignore the out-of-work temporal demands that workers face and which compound on-the-job demands. Redesign of the temporalities of working life within worksites need to be accompanied by society-level policies which address caring responsibilities, gender equality as well as broad labour market conditions."
"Towards a framework for critical social marketing: what is to be done for emancipation? Social Marketing; Wicked Problems; Marketers In this paper, we aim to theoretically advance critical social marketing (CSM). Our purpose is to advance a guiding ethos for the disparate corpus of CSM scholarship and encourage social marketers to become more critically informed in their research and practice. We introduce a critically reflexive, decolonising, intersectional, and trauma-informed CSM framework for social marketing theory, research, and practice towards emancipatory behaviour and social change. Our framework is applied in the context of the social problem of child labour. We then discuss and offer conclusions of the implications of our CSM framework, provide suggestions for a future research agenda that challenges scholars to engage in critically informed research and practice in social marketing."
"Local government co-ordination: metropolitan governance in twenty-first century Australia Housing Supply; Suburban Area; Brisbane â€¢ Continuing growth of, and interdependencies within, Australiaâ€™s metropolitan city-regions increase the need for efficient coordination and effective metropolitan governance structures. â€¢ Metropolitan governance structures vary greatly between Australian states, and consequently there are different levels of local government engagement with strategic policy and action. â€¢ Australia can gain insights from international examples about possible models for local government coordination and metropolitan governance, and vice versa. â€¢ State governments are the dominant actors for urban planning and transport infrastructure and, consequently, also often the driving force for metropolitan strategy-making and coordination at this scale. â€¢ Local governments have no constitutional powers, but still hold an important role in metropolitan strategy-making and policy coordination. â€¢ Recent planning and infrastructure reforms in Australian states indicate a trend towards further centralisation at state level, with (planning) powers of local government being weakened for both policy-making and in development assessment. â€¢ Such trends are being exacerbated by local government reform, pursued in the interest of increased efficiency but often resulting in reduced local control. â€¢ The trends of centralisation and weakening of local government powers raise questions about subsidiarity (taking decisions as close to the citizens as possible), democracy and legitimacy. â€¢ Nonetheless, there are numerous examples of informal and bottom-up strategic coordination of local government. This often occurs on a sub-regional level within metropolitan regions, and has two objectives: advocacy, and coordination of specific issues (including major projects). â€¢ Although often informal or ad hoc, existing experiments in local government can offer examples of how to strengthen and improve government coordination on a metropolitan level. â€¢ There is an increasing role for a policy framework for metropolitan regions and that better supports multi-level governance and coordination, including the role of local government authorities."
"International approaches to protecting and retaining trees on private urban land Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Most studies of urban forest management look at vegetation on public land. Yet, to meet ambitious urban forest targets, cities must attempt to maintain or increase trees and canopy cover on private urban land too. In this study, we review and evaluate international approaches to protecting and retaining trees on private urban land. Our study combines a systematic academic literature review, two empirical social science studies on the views of urban forest professionals, and a global case study review of innovative regulations and incentives aimed at protecting and retaining trees on private urban land. Case studies were evaluated for the extent they exceeded minimum standards or went beyond â€˜business-as-usualâ€™. We found that the most innovative mechanisms combine many regulations, instead of relying on a single regulation, and use financial incentives to retain or plant trees in newly developed or re-developed sites, as well as private residences. We did not find any cases where appropriate monitoring was in place to determine the efficacy and efficiency of these mechanisms. We also found no single simple solution that could effectively and efficiently protect and retain trees on private land. Only by combining policies, planning schemes, local laws, and financial incentives with community engagement and stewardship will cities protect and retain trees on private land. Useful and innovative ways to protecting and retaining trees on private land involves providing solutions at multiple governments levels, embedding trees in existing strategic policy and management solutions, incentivising positive behavior, creating regulations that require payment up front, and engaging the broader community in private tree stewardship."
"The importance of setting and therapeutic relationships when delivering chiropractic care to those living with disadvantage Multimorbidity; Multiple Chronic Conditions; Chronic Disease Background: Chiropractic is a mostly privatised health profession within Australia, with people experiencing disadvantage typically having limited access due to financial barriers. However, some universities within Australia offer community outreach clinics where students provide chiropractic care to people living with disadvantage. This demographic experiences higher rates of chronic conditions including musculoskeletal complaints and requires subsidisation to access privatised care. This need also offers opportunity for the chiropractic profession to work within community healthcare teams. A mixed-methods observational study was used to investigate how the unique setting of a student chiropractic community clinic may influence the experience and outcomes of those who attend. Methods: Three patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) investigated client outcomes: Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP); European Five Domain Five Level Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L); and the Patient Enablement Instrument. The PROMs data were analysed descriptively and inferentially. Interviews were conducted with clients who had received chiropractic care, chiropractic students, clinical supervisors and staff of the centre. Interview data were coded using thematic analysis, and themes were formed using Bronfenbrennerâ€™s socio-ecological systems framework and non-participant observations. Results: Thirty-seven participants completed baseline PROMs and 17 completed follow-ups after four treatments. Seventy-two percent of participants nominated their primary complaint as chronic. Significant change was noted in general health and wellbeing for the MYMOP, pain and disability for the EQ-5D-5L and index scores for the EQ-5D-5L suggested improved health and wellbeing. Most clients experienced higher levels of enablement post treatment. Twelve participants were interviewed (four were clients), with five themes emerging from the interview data. Clients reported their lived experiences impacted their health problems and attending the clinic offered benefits beyond improvement of pain and disability. Conclusions: Interview data suggested that these benefits were due to a combination of therapy, the setting and the relationships formed within that setting. Complementing this, PROM data suggested clients experienced better levels of health and wellbeing and decreased levels of pain and disability. Findings indicated that people who experienced disadvantage may receive broader benefits from attending community centres offering chiropractic care. Services such as chiropractic may be complementary in meeting the healthcare needs of those experiencing disadvantage."
"Show me the data!: Uncovering the evidence in screen media industry research American Film; Newsreels; Theaters Data can take many forms, can come from a variety of sources, and can vary in size. In this chapter, we focus on quantitative data and address how â€œbig dataâ€ has created a range of new options for evaluating movie and broader industry performance. As a starting point, quantitative data provide the facts or evidence that at a summary level can be used as a reference to describe the state of the world as it stands. However, the use of data can enable further analysis using a range of techniques (such as data visualization) and quantitative methods (such as econometric modelling) to solve real world problems and address issues with policy relevance such as gender equality in the film industry."
"Why Disability Mainstreaming is Good for Business: A New Narrative Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy In developed economies, powerful legislative and regulatory frameworks, for people with disability (PWD) over the last five decades, have provided major motivation for business compliance with disability in the workplaces. However, developing economy like India is marked by emergent disability legislation, weak institutional enforcement and an evolving disability rights movement. In the absence of strong institutional expectations, the private sectorâ€™s role in mainstreaming the disability agenda has been largely an act of voluntary participation. Drawing upon an in-depth, multilevel, cross-functional qualitative study of four Indian information technology sector companies, this paper explores why these companies engage in pro-social corporate behaviour in favour of disability. The study locates itself in the context of conceptualization of PWD as employee stakeholders and the literature on strategic CSR. The findings reveal that strategic factors promote voluntary business engagement with disability at workplaces and contribute to understanding of workplace integration of minority employees."
"Inward foreign direct investment in emerging economies: a review and future research avenues Foreign Direct Investment; Economic Growth; Learning by Exporting Purpose: Given the surge in foreign direct investment (FDI) in emerging economies (EEs) during the past four decades, inward FDI (IFDI) has spawned a rich, scholarly conversation on the topic. This paper aims to review the literature regarding EE IFDI determinants and the impact of IFDI on those economies. It also aims to provide some future research directions. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review with thematic analysis of 372 articles on the topic, published between 1991 and 2021, is undertaken. In addition to using the relevant keywords, the snowballing approach was used to manually track the literature. Findings: This review highlights EE IFDI determinants such as institutional quality, corruption and intellectual property rights, regional trade agreements and distances, formal and informal institutions and their interactions, national and subnational diversity and policy expectations. Further, IFDI impacts EEs both at macro- and micro-levels. This review also indicates a substantial increase in research during the period 2000 to 2010 and a decline thereafter; it also indicates Africa and Latin America being under-researched, with a focus on Africa recently increasing. Research limitations/implications: Rich research opportunities exist in examining the mechanisms (mediators) and conditions (moderators) that influence relationships between the antecedents of IFDI and their outcomes. Further opportunities exist in examining the role of the context and in undertaking a multilevel analysis. Originality/value: This review provides an understanding of what influences multinational enterprisesâ€™ FDI to EEs and how it impacts those economies. It also raises potential future research questions. It provides a holistic understanding of the chosen scope and domain."
"Sustainable management of groundwater extraction: An Australian perspective on current challenges Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Study region: Australia Study focus: Our incomplete knowledge of groundwater systems and processes imposes barriers in attempting to manage groundwater sustainably. Challenges also arise through complex institutional arrangements and decision-making processes, and the difficulty in involving stakeholders. In some areas, these difficulties have led to water table decline and impacts on groundwater users and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. However, there is potential to improve the sustainable use of groundwater resources through improvements in management practices. We discuss some of the challenges, and present survey results of research, government, and industry professionals across the groundwater sector in Australia. New hydrological insights for the region: The highest-ranked challenge identified in the survey was the difficulty in determining regional-scale volumetric water extraction limits. This is surprising given the criticism in the international literature of volumetric based approaches for groundwater management, and the decreased reliance on this approach in Australia and elsewhere in recent years. Other major challenges are the difficulty in determining and implementing maximum drawdown criteria for groundwater levels, determining water needs of ecosystems, and managing groundwater impacts on surface water. Notwithstanding these gaps in technical understanding and tools and a lack of resources for groundwater studies, improvements in stakeholder communication should enable more effective decision-making and improve compliance with regulations designed to protect groundwater and dependent ecosystems."
"The co-application of biochar with bioremediation for the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from contaminated soil Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Soil pollution from petroleum hydrocarbon is a global environmental problem that could contribute to the non-actualisation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Several techniques have been used to remediate petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soils; however, there are technical and economical limitations to existing methods. As such, the development of new approaches and the improvement of existing techniques are imperative. Biochar, a low-cost carbonaceous product of the thermal decomposition of waste biomass has gained relevance in soil remediation. Biochar has been applied to remediate hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, with positive and negative results reported. Consequently, attempts have been made to improve the performance of biochar in the hydrocarbon-based remediation process through the co-application of biochar with other bioremediation techniques as well as modifying biochar properties before use. Despite the progress made in this domain, there is a lack of a detailed single review consolidating the critical findings, new developments, and challenges in biochar-based remediation of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soil. This review assessed the potential of biochar co-application with other well-known bioremediation techniques such as bioaugmentation, phytoremediation, and biostimulation. Additionally, the benefits of modification in enhancing biochar suitability for bioremediation were examined. It was concluded that biochar co-application generally resulted in higher hydrocarbon removal than sole biochar treatment, with up to a 4-fold higher removal observed in some cases. However, most of the biochar co-applied treatments did not result in hydrocarbon removal that was greater than the additive effects of individual treatment. Overall, compared to their complementary treatments, biochar co-application with bioaugmentation was more beneficial in hydrocarbon removal than biochar co-application with either phytoremediation or biostimulation. Future studies should integrate the ecotoxicological and cost implications of biochar co-application for a viable remediation process. Lastly, improving the synergistic interactions of co-treatment on hydrocarbon removal is critical to capturing the full potential of biochar-based remediation."
"When institutional logics meet information and communication technologies: Examining hybrid information practices in Ghana’s agriculture Institutional Work; Illegitimacy; Microfoundations In this paper, we describe how changes in the availability of information artifactsâ€” in particular, information and communication technologies (ICTs)â€”among smallholder farmers in Ghana, led to a process of hybridization of information practices, and how this process could be linked to underlying institutional change. We use the notions of institutional carriers and activity systems to study the evolution of the prevailing â€œsmallholderâ€ institutional logic of Ghanaian agriculture toward an incoming â€œvalue-chainâ€ institutional logic concerned with linking farmers to output markets, improving the knowledge base in agriculture, and increasing its information intensity. We draw on a mixed-methods approach, including in-depth qualitative interviews, focus groups, observations, and detailed secondary quantitative data. We cultivate activity theory as a practice-based lens for structuring inquiry into institutional change. We find that information artifacts served to link the activities of farmers that were embedded in the smallholder logic with those of agricultural-development actors that promoted the value-chain logic. Hybridization occurred through the use of artifacts with different interaction modalities. In terms of conceptualizing change, our findings suggest that hybridization of the two logics may be an intermediary point in the long transition from the smallholder toward the value-chain logic."
"Assessing agricultural drought management strategies in the Northern Murray–Darling Basin Droughts; Evapotranspiration; China The Northern Murrayâ€“Darling Basin (MDB) is a key Australian agricultural region requiring efficient Agricultural Drought Management (ADM), focused on resilience. Although a need for resilience in local farming communities has long been recognised, previous studies assessing ADM in the Northern MDB did not consider two key elements of resilient management: proactivity (preparing for drought prior to a drought event) and suitability (localised drought management targeted at decision-makers). This study assessed the current ADM Strategy (ADMS) implemented within five selected Northern MDB Local Government Areas (LGAs) (Paroo Shire, Balonne Shire, Murweh Shire, Maranoa Region, and Goondiwindi Region), specifically investigating the extent of ADMS proactivity, effectiveness, and suitability. To investigate suitability, drought risk extent of each LGA was determined. A region-specific drought risk index consisting of hazard, vulnerability and exposure indices was developed; risk mapping was conducted. All LGAs displayed very high levels of drought risk due to hazardous climatic conditions, vulnerable socio-economic attributes, and drought-exposed geographical features. A Criteria-Based Ranking (CBR) survey produced a quantitative effectiveness and proactivity rank for each major ADMS used in the Northern MDB. Government Assistance was the most proactive and effective ADMS. Strategy effectiveness ranks of the major ADMS used and drought risk extent found in each LGA were correlated to determine ADMS suitability. Overall, Balonne Shire and the Goondiwindi Region were identified as high priority areas requiring improved ADM. A user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought could potentially increase ADM proactivity and suitability in such areas, strengthening drought resilience of farming communities."
"Employment discrimination against gender diverse individuals in Western Australia Transgender Persons; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Workplace Purpose: This paper explores employment discrimination against gender diverse job applicants and employees in Western Australia (WA). Design/methodology/approach: Using grounded theory, this study draws on semi-structured interviews with respondents (n = 20) who identified as trans women, trans men, nonbinary or agender. Thematic analysis focused on the multiple dimensions of disadvantage experienced by respondents, including subtle, not so subtle and overt types of employment discrimination. Findings: The authorsâ€™ results point to several reasons why gender diverse individuals (GDIs) may fear the labor market, including difficulties in concealing their stigma and acquiescence to discrimination. On the other hand, our results also point to sources of organizational support, including encouragement from direct line managers and colleagues who are also Allies. Practical implications: The results of the research have important implications for sociological frameworks surrounding dramaturgy, stigma, aesthetic labor, organizational silence and social identity. Practical implications for employers, employees, human resource (HR) professionals and trade unions are also articulated. Originality/value: Whereas previous studies have prioritized the discriminatory experiences of GDIs in the US and European labor markets, this study reports on gender diverse voices in WA. Furthermore, recent work on this topic has been experimental and largely quantitative, whereas the present study offers a compelling set of profound narratives, thereby addressing calls for qualitative research that foregrounds the complexities and nuances of lived experience for GDIs and renders their voices heard."
"Coercive control of money, dowry and remittances among Indian migrant women in Australia Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Help-Seeking This paper examines how coercive control underlies financial abuse as men re-interpret the gender of money, stripping it of its moral safeguards. Financial abuse denies women access and agency over money. It works through male reinterpretation of how money is genderedâ€“that is the way men and women own, inherit, use, manage and control money. Recent Indian migrant women experience coercive control when the male control of money is exercised without responsibility for the welfare of the wife and children. The family boundary of money becomes a way of extorting money from the wifeâ€™s family. Sending money home, a sign of filial responsibility, becomes abusive when the wife is not consulted, leaving the family in Australia without sufficient money for their settlement needs. This paper extends the theoretical and geographic breadth of studies of family violence among Indian women in the diaspora."
"Informal Networks, Informal Institutions, and Social Exclusion in the Workplace: Insights from Subsidiaries of Multinational Corporations in Korea Guanxi; China; Managerial Ties Drawing on interviews with decision makers in multinational corporations (MNCs) in South Korea, we examine the role of informal networks in the social exclusion of women in the workforce. Although legislation in the country is in favor of gender equality, we found that informal barriers in the workplace remain difficult to overcome. Informal networks in Korea, yongo, present an ethical issue in the workplace, as they tend to socially exclude women, limiting possibilities for their participation and career progression. We found that informal networks are pervasive and strong because of the informal institutions in which they are embedded and that there is a complex interplay between informal networks and informal institutions that socially excludes women. Due to difficulties accessing yongo, women appear to build inmaek, a network type that is more open and accessible. We also found that MNCs in Korea can compensate for the lack of local informal networks for their female employees. However, despite providing a more supportive environment for women at work, gender equality policies in MNCs are not yet as effective as they could be due to the dynamics of the workplace and the fact that the policies are not tailored to the local context. We have seen evidence in recent years that MNCs can serve as role models for implementing gender equality policies by creating a more inclusive work environment and demonstrating leadership commitment and support."
"Data mining approach to model bus crash severity in Australia Crash Injuries; Crash; Random Parameters Introduction: Buses are different vehicles in terms of dimensions, maneuverability, and driver's vision. Although bus traveling is a safe mode to travel, the number of annual bus crashes cannot be neglected. Moreover, limited studies have been conducted on the bus involved in fatal crashes. Therefore, identification of the contributing factors in the bus involved fatal crashes can reduce the risk of fatality. Method: Data set of bus involved crashes in the State of Victoria, Australia was analyzed over the period of 2006â€“2019. Clustering of crash data was accomplished by dividing them into homogeneous categories, and by implementing association rules discovery on the clusters, the factors affecting fatality in bus involved crashes were extracted. Results: Clustering results show bus crashes with all vehicles except motor vehicles and weekend crashes have a high rate of fatality. According to the association rule discovery findings, the factors that increase the risk of bus crashes with non-motor vehicles are: old bus driver, collision with pedestrians at signalized intersections, and the presence of vulnerable road users. Likewise, factors that increase the risk of fatality in bus involved crashes on weekends are: darkness of roads in high-speed zones, pedestrian presence at highways, bus crashes with passenger car by a female bus driver, and the occurrence of multi-vehicle crashes in high-speed zones. Practical Applications: The study provides a sequential pattern of factors, named rules that lead to fatality in bus involved crashes. By eliminating or improving one or all of the factors involved in rules, fatal bus crashes may be prevented. The recommendations to reduce fatality in bus crashes are: observing safe distances with the buses, using road safety campaigns to reduce pedestriansâ€™ distracted behavior, improving the lighting conditions, implementing speed bumps and rumble strips in high-speed zones, installing pedestrian detection systems on buses and setting special bus lanes in crowded areas."
"Prevalence and intensity of cardicola spp. Infection in ranched southern bluefin tuna and a comparison of diagnostic methods Opecoelidae; Digenea (Trematoda); Animals The parasitic blood flukes Cardicola forsteri and C. orientalis are an ongoing health concern for Southern Bluefin Tuna Thunnus maccoyii (SBT) ranched in Australia. In this study we compared the effect of treatment, company, and ranching year on blood fluke infections in ranched SBT. SBT were sampled during the 2018 and 2019 ranching seasons from praziquantel (PZQ) treated pontoons and untreated pontoons managed by two companies. Severity of infection was diagnosed by several criteria including adult fluke counts from hearts, egg counts from gill filaments and the use of specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for detection of C. forsteri and C. orientalis ITS-2 DNA in SBT hearts and gills. PZQ treatment remains highly effective against C. forsteri infection. Prevalence and intensity of Cardicola spp. infection was lower in 2019 than 2018 for Company A in treated pontoons at week 12 and week 17 of ranching, and lower for Company A than Company B in untreated pontoons at month 5 of ranching. Results indicate re-infection may be less likely in the environment near Company A pontoons, and consistent years of treatment may have lowered the parasite load in the environment. qPCR demonstrated higher sensitivity when comparing diagnostic methods for C. forsteri in heart, and higher specificity when comparing diagnostic methods for Cardicola spp. in gills. Continuing to monitor blood fluke infections in ranched SBT can help to detect changes in drug efficacy over time and help industry to develop a best practice for treatment."
"Face-to-face vs. virtual assistance to entrepreneurs: Evidence from a field experiment in Brazil Shadow Economy; Informality; Informal Sector We conduct a field experiment on formalization and subsequent tax compliance of informal entrepreneurs in Rio de Janeiro favelas. Providing in-person one-on-one training with the offer of one-on-one assistance with the formalization process increased information levels about the program, intention to formalize, formalization, and subsequent tax compliance. Providing essentially the same information and assistance via instant messaging produced similar effects on knowledge and intention to formalize, but no effects on formalization itself."
"Prescriptive training courseware: IS-design methodology Cognitive Style; Personnel; Human Dimensions Information systems (IS) research is found in many diverse communities. This paper explores the human-dimension of human-computer interaction (HCI) to present IS-design practice in the light of courseware development. Assumptions are made that online courseware provides the perfect solution for maintaining a knowledgeable, well skilled workforce. However, empirical investigations into the effectiveness of information technology (IT)-induced training solutions are scarce. Contemporary research concentrates on information communications technology (ICT) training tools without considering their effectiveness. This paper offers a prescriptive IS-design methodology for managing the requirements for efficient and effective courseware development. To develop the methodology, we examined the main instructional design (ID) factors that affect the design of IT-induced training programs. We also examined the tension between maintaining a well-skilled workforce and effective instructional systems design (ISD) practice by probing the current ID models used by courseware developers since 1990. An empirical research project, which utilized this IS-design methodology investigated the effectiveness of using IT to train government employees in introductory ethics; this was a study that operationalized the interactive effect of cognitive preference and instructional format on training performance outcomes. The data was analysed using Rasch item response theory (IRT) that models the discrimination of people's performance relative to each other's performance and the test-items' difficulty relative to each test-item on the same logit scale. The findings revealed that IS training solutions developed using this IS-design methodology can be adapted to provide trainees with their preferred instructional mode and facilitate cost effective eTraining outcomes."
"Online learning framework - Rapid framework development as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic Distance Education; Social Presence; Online Discussion The Covid-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on the world, with the education sector seeing considerable disruption. The practice of social distancing and mandatory lockdowns resulted in the near total closure of schools and universities in many countries across the globe. This led to the need for many institutions to conduct their classes online. There are many examples of how universities transitioned to online teaching during the pandemic, however, this paper will contribute to the body of knowledge by sharing the experiences of academic staff in an international offshore campus in South East Asia. Based on experience, the challenges and benefits of online education are discussed from the perspectives of students, parents and lecturers. Furthermore, the paper elucidates the use of an online framework to provide institution-wide support, enhance the benefits of online learning and mitigate its pitfalls. Reflections from lecturers offer insights running an online class with this framework. The authors recommend the use of an institution wide framework and support to facilitate a smooth transition to online classes and promote long-term sustainability of online learning. Authentic assessments also play a pivotal role in online learning."
"Changing Police Officers’ Attitudes in Sexual Offense Cases: A 12-Month Follow-Up Study Rape; Sexual Assault; Offenders We examined whether specialist training can have an immediate and lasting impact on investigatorsâ€™ attitudes in sexual offense cases. Australian police officers participated in a 4-week training program that focused on the dynamics of sexual offending. Officers completed questionnaires before, immediately after, and 9 to 12 months following training. They were presented with scenarios involving adult and child complainants with varying levels of evidence (strong, weak, or ambiguous) and rated their confidence that the case would be approved for prosecution, the likelihood of a guilty verdict, and the level of responsibility attributed to the victim. Following training, investigators became more confident in case approvals and guilty verdicts, less likely to attribute responsibility to victims, and demonstrated better understanding of sexual offense dynamics. Ratings of victim responsibility and guilty verdicts were maintained 9 to 12 months post-training; however, confidence in case approvals decreased after working in the field. Implications for police training programs are discussed."
"Technology-Facilitated Domestic and Sexual Violence: A Review Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica This article investigates the phenomenon of domestic and sexual violence against adult women using digital communications technologies. The article explores terminological and conceptual challenges and describes the empirical research literature in this field to date in relation to digital dating abuse, intimate partner cyberstalking, technology-facilitated sexual assault, image-based sexual abuse, and online sexual harassment. The article also discusses policy and practice responses to this growing problem, as well as future directions for research. We argue that research and practice need to be guided by existing conceptual frameworks that utilize gender and actorâ€“network theory to understanding the causes and consequences of womenâ€™s experiences of abuse and violence facilitated by digital technologies."
"Assessing the impact of using instant messaging in elearning on the performance of teaching and learning in higher education Digital Natives; Education; Information Literacy There are growing interests in improving teaching and learning performance through eLearning using specific emerging technologies in higher education. As a result, understanding the impact of using such technologies on the performance of teaching and learning is becoming important. This experimental study investigates the impact of eLearning using instant messaging on the performance of teaching and learning in higher education in developing countries. Pre-test and post-test surveys are used for collecting experimental data from participants to investigate the impact of using instant messaging on teaching and learning. Data analysis conducted quantitatively using SPSS reveals that eLearning using instant messaging improves teaching and learning. In particular, the use of instant messaging in eLearning is more effective than face-to-face teaching and learning with respect to the overall performance in the classroom. This leads to the conclusion that eLearning using instant messaging could transform teaching and learning in higher education in developing countries."
"Moving from the traditional paradigm of pathogen inactivation to controlling antibiotic resistance in water - Role of ultraviolet irradiation Disinfection; Photoreactivation; Light Emitting Diodes Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation has proven an effective tool for inactivating microorganisms in water. There is, however, a need to look at disinfection from a different perspective because microbial inactivation alone may not be sufficient to ensure the microbiological safety of the treated water since pathogenic genes may still be present, even after disinfection. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are of a particular concern since they enable microorganisms to become resistant to antibiotics. UV irradiation has been widely used for disinfection and more recently for destroying ARGs. While UV lamps remain the principal technology to achieve this objective, UV light emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) are novel sources of UV irradiation and have increasingly been reported in lab-scale investigations as a potential alternative. This review discusses the current state of the applications of UV technology for controlling antibiotic resistance during water and wastewater treatment. Since UV-LEDs possess several attractive advantages over conventional UV lamps, the impact of UV-LED characteristics (single vs combined wavelengths, and operational parameters such as periodic or pulsed and continuous irradiation, pulse repetition frequencies, duty cycle), type of organism, and fluence response, are critically reviewed with a view to highlighting the research needs for addressing future disinfection challenges. The energy efficiency of the reported UV processes is also evaluated with a focus on relating the findings to disinfection efficacy. The greater experience with UV lamps could be useful for investigating UV-LEDs for similar applications (i.e., antibiotic resistance control), and hence identification of future research directions."
"Comparative Genome Analysis of Two Heterotrophic Nitrifying Pseudomonas putida Strains Isolated from Freshwater Shrimp Ponds in Soc Trang Province Bacteria; Denitrifying Bacterium; Nitrification Nitrogen compounds, especially ammonia, are widely produced in aquaculture systems during cultivation. Ammonia has been investigated as a model compound for use by heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria. Pseudomonas TT321 and Pseudomonas TT322, isolated from shrimp pond water in Soc Trang province, Vietnam, are identified by comparing them with 31 of the closest genomes sequences from the NCBI nucleotide database. The genome sizes of strains TT321 and TT322 were 5,566,241 bp and 5,563,644 bp, respectively. No plasmids were evident in these strains. Genome analysis revealed that TT321 and TT322 belonged to Pseudomonas putida and shared a common ancestor with 33 genomes. Analysis based on the comparison of genomes showed that three genes, carbamate kinase (arcC), glutamine synthetase (Glul), and aminomethyltransferase (amt), are involved in three metabolic pathways. These pathways are: (i) arginine and proline metabolism, (ii) alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and (iii) glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. These genes may play important roles in ammonia reduction and support bacterial growth via ammonia assimilation."
"Performance Evaluation of Lane Detection and Tracking Algorithm Based on Learning-Based Approach for Autonomous Vehicle Camera; Vanishing Point; Driver Assistance Disruptive technology, especially autonomous vehicles, is predicted to provide higher safety and reduce road traffic emissions. Lane detection and tracking are critical building blocks for developing autonomous or intelligent vehicles. This study presents a lane detecting algorithm for autonomous vehicles on different road pavements (structured and unstructured roads) to overcome challenges such as the low detection accuracy of lane detection and tracking. First, datasets for performance evaluation were created using an interpolation method. Second, a learning-based approach was used to create an algorithm using the steering angle, yaw angle, and sideslip angle as inputs for the adaptive controller. Finally, simulation tests for the lane recognition method were carried out by utilising a road driving video in Melbourne, Australia, and the BDD100K dataset created by the Berkeley DeepDrive Industrial Consortium. The mean detection accuracy ranges from 97% to 99%, and the detection time ranges from 20 to 22 ms under various road conditions with our proposed algorithm. This lane detection algorithm outperformed conventional techniques in terms of accuracy and processing time, as well as efficiency in lane detection and overcoming road interferences. The proposed algorithm will contribute to advancing the lane detection and tracking of intelligent-vehicle driving assistance and help further improve intelligent vehicle driving safety."
"Analysis of dependence structure among investor sentiment, policy uncertainty and international oil prices Oil Price Shocks; Oil Markets; Petroleum The behavioural aspect of finance and economics has an embedded importance in the literature. This paper provides an evidence of the interrelationship of international oil prices with economic policy uncertainty, consumer sentiments and US investor sentiment proxies. To test the underlying dependence structure, we employ time invariant and time-varying copula methods due to dynamic return patterns of our sampled indices. Our analysis reveals an underlying relationship of investor sentiments and economic policy uncertainty with international oil prices not only during normal periods but also in the periods of financial turmoil. Results of our nonlinear causality highlight potential of bidirectional spillover between oil prices and investor sentiment indices across all quantiles. This helps in understanding that a volatile international oil market may have significant impact on investor sentiments and economic policy uncertainty and vice versa."
"Carbon and polymer-based magnetic nanocomposites for oil-spill remediation—a comprehensive review Water; Hydrophobicity; Aerogels Oil spills are a major contributor to water contamination, which sets off a significant impact on the environment, biodiversity, and economy. Efficient removal of oil spills is needed for the protection of marine species as well as the environment. Conventional approaches are not efficient enough for oil-water separation; therefore, effective strategies and efficient removal techniques (and materials) must be developed to restore the contaminated marine to its normal ecology. Several research studies have shown that nanotechnology provides efficient features to clean up these oil spills from the water using magnetic nanomaterials, particularly carbon/polymer-based magnetic nanocomposites. Surface modification of these nanomaterials via different techniques render them with salient innovative features. The present review discusses the advantages and limitations of conventional and advanced techniques for the oil spills removal from wastewater. Furthermore, the synthesis of magnetic nanocomposites, their utilization in oil-water separation, and adsorption mechanisms are discussed. Finally, the advancement and future perspectives of magnetic nanocomposites (particularly of carbon and polymer-based magnetic nanocomposites) in environmental remediation are presented."
"Improvement of anaerobic digestion of sewage mixed sludge using free nitrous acid and Fenton pre-treatment Activated Sludge; Anaerobic Digestion; Pretreatment Background: Recently, it has been indicated that free nitrous acid (FNA) and Fenton pre-treatment of waste activated sludge can enhance methane production in anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge. In addition, it has been revealed that the substances used in these pre-treatments are both eco-friendly and economically attractive because not only are they produced in anaerobic digestion, but they are also low priced. Since primary sludge and waste activated sludge are mixed prior to anaerobic digestion in the majority of wastewater treatment plants, this study aims to assess the influence of combined FNA and Fenton on the anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge. Results: According to this study's results, methane generation from anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge was enhanced when using FNA and Fenton pre-treatment, affirming the effectiveness of the individual and combined pre-treatments in anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge. The enhanced methane production was significant in combined pre-treatments (up to 72%), compared with FNA and Fenton pre-treatment alone (25% and 27%, respectively). This corroborates the positive synergistic effect of the combined pre-treatments on methane production. The enhanced methane can be attributed to augmented soluble fractions of organic matter in addition to increased readily biodegradable organic matter, caused by the pre-treatments. Additionally, the amount of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was assessed during anaerobic digestion, and it was revealed that COD decreased considerably when the pre-treatment strategies were combined. Conclusions: This study reveals that the pre-treatments are potentially applicable to full-scale wastewater treatment plants because a mixture of primary sludge and waste activated sludge was used for the pre-treatments. Additionally, combined FNA and Fenton pre-treatments prove more effective in enhancing methane production and organic removal than these pre-treatments alone. The enhanced methane production is important for two reasons: a higher amount of renewable energy could be generated from the enhanced methane production and the COD of digested sludge reduces in such a way that facilitates application of the sludge to agricultural lands and reduces sludge transport costs."
"The rise of ‘smart’ solutions in Africa: a review of the socio-environmental cost of the transportation and employment benefits of ride-hailing technology in Ghana Ghana; Urban Planning; Resource Curse Governments in Africa are licensing major global ride-hailing firms to launch operations in the continent. This is often presented as a refreshing development for the continent to leverage technology to address its twin problems of inefficient urban transport and rising youth unemployment. Interviews with ride-hailing adopters (drivers, riders, and car owners) and researchers in Ghana suggest, however, that whereas the technology is driving up the standards of road transport experience, the benefits are accessible to a select few (largely, the younger, highly educated and relatively high income-earning class). The lopsided power relations underlying the ride-hailing industry have also meant that the economic opportunities it avails disproportionately benefit a few powerful players (e.g. ride-hailing firms and car owners) while stimulating â€˜turf warsâ€™ among online and traditional taxi drivers; deepening existing gender inequalities in access to income-earning opportunities in the commercial passenger transport sector; encouraging unhealthy driving practices, shifts from shared public transport, and inundation of the roads with more private cars. While it will be imprecise to say that the private gains of ride-hailing outstrip the public costs and, therefore, the technology is detrimental to Ghanaâ€™s development, the considered evidence raises the need for sustained scrutiny of the hailing of technological interventions as though they are the magic bullets for socio-economic transformation in Africa. Overall, the paper argues that dismantling the power structures underlying Africaâ€™s urban challenges will require more than splashing â€˜smartâ€™ apps and other tech wizardries around. Indeed, the lessons from Ghanaâ€™s ride-hailing industry suggest that such exclusively technical solutions could easily take root and pattern after existing strictures of unjust power structures in ways that could exacerbate the social and environmental problems they are supposed to address."
"A Micro Multi-blade Vertical Axis Wind Turbine for Built-Up Areas Rotor; Solidity; Hydromechanics Rising greenhouse gas emission and global warming compel the world community to look for renewable energy sources to generate power. The renewable wind energy provides an alternative to fossil fuel. A significant research attention has been placed on the use of vertical axis wind turbine due to its low-wind operational capability. However, the effectiveness of traditional vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) in built-up areas is below expectation. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to develop a single stage drag-based multi-blade micro vertical axis wind turbine which can generate a reasonable amount of torque and power in complex wind conditions in built-up areas."
"The Evolving Facets of Bacterial Vaginosis: Implications for HIV Transmission Vagina Flora; Gardnerella Vaginalis; Atopobium Vaginae Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common yet poorly understood vaginal condition that has become a major focus of HIV transmission and immunology research. Varied terminologies are used by clinicians and researchers to describe microbial communities that reside in the female reproductive tract (FRT), which is driven, in part, by microbial genetic and metabolic complexity, evolving diagnostic and molecular techniques, and multidisciplinary perspectives of clinicians, epidemiologists, microbiologists, and immunologists who all appreciate the scientific importance of understanding mechanisms that underlie BV. This Perspectives article aims to clarify the varied terms used to describe the cervicovaginal microbiota and its ""nonoptimal"" state, under the overarching term of BV. The ultimate goal is to move toward language standardization in future literature that facilitates a better understanding of the impact of BV on FRT immunology and risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV."
"Foreign aid and development goals: Revisiting the evidence Aid; Official Development Assistance; International Cooperation In this chapter, the authors examine the impact of foreign aid on eight development targets capturing poverty, education, extreme hunger, gender equality, child mortality, maternal mortality, prevalence of HIV and access to portable water. Findings show that an increase in net Official Development Assistance (ODA) is associated with a decline in the prevalence of HIV and child mortality. The authors further examine the role of sectoral aid in the development process and show that targeted aid is likely to be more beneficial for development."
"Information asymmetry and credit rating: A quasi-natural experiment from China Sovereign Ratings; Credit Rating Agencies; Firm We examine how the issuer-paid incumbent credit rating agencies (CRAs) in China adjust their rating strategies in response to the 2010 entry of an independent credit rating agency, China Bond Rating (CBR) between 2006 and 2015. The business model that CBR employs is a combination of the public utility model and the investor-paid model. We find that the CBR's ratings coverage effectively reduced the information asymmetry in the Chinese corporate bond market. The evidence shows decreased ratings inflation and increased informativeness of rating change announcements by incumbent issuer-paid CRAs after CBR entered the market. The findings suggest that a firm's credibility is an important channel driving issuer-paid incumbent CRAsâ€™ strategic ratings. Our paper provides new information and insight into the debate of whether CRAs with alternative business models can alleviate the information asymmetry problem."
"Downshifting to care: The role of gender and care in reducing working hours and consumption Personnel; Hours of Work; Work Schedules The relationship between working hours and sustainability has attracted research attention since at least the early 2000s, yet the role of care giving in this context is not well understood. Focusing on Australians between 40 and 60 years who have reduced their working hours and income, we explore the relationship between working hours, care giving and consumption. Data from the national census (ABS, 2006, 2011, 2016c) were analysed to contextualise patterns in paid working hours, income and carer roles for men and women aged between 40 and 60 years. Findings from a national survey on informal carers (ABS, 2016a) were also consulted. Taken together, the two sources of national data showed that two thirds of all informal carers are women, that the likelihood of assuming informal carer roles increases with age, and that men and women in carer roles work fewer paid hours per week and have a lower weekly income than non-carers of the same age. To gain qualitative insights into these patterns in Australian national data, and the likely implications of carer roles for household consumption, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten households who subsequently recorded details of their consumption-related expenses over a seven-day period. The interview data showed the strong connection between carer roles, reduced income and paid working hours and its strongly gendered dimension. We argue that women primarily â€˜downshiftâ€™ to undertake care rather than for sustainability motivations and that there is consequently a need to connect scholarship on gender and care with that on downshifting. The link between reducing paid working hours, care-giving and household consumption appeared to be less straight forward and varied between households. Our findings suggest that a complex relationship exists between environmental and social welfare concerns that has policy implications and warrants further exploration."
"A fresh look at contemporary perspectives on urban housing affordability Housing Affordability; Costs And Cost Analysis; Mortgages The literature on housing affordability has grown rapidly since Hulchanski [1995, p. 489. The concept of housing affordability: six contemporary uses of the housing expenditure-to-income ratio. Housing Studies, 10(4), 471â€“491] declared that housing researchers should avoid using the term since it is not a robust concept and measurement often lacks validity. In the ensuing 24 years, however, scholars have continued to debate the definition and measurement of housing affordability as well as the prevalence and type of â€˜housing affordability problemsâ€™ in various countries. This paper is a think piece which takes a fresh look at housing affordability as a concept which has persisted despite considerable contestation and scepticism about its use. It provides a critical and multi-disciplinary assessment of housing affordability starting with early conceptualization of the nexus between economic principles and social norms about housing and living standards to a reworking of housing affordability in the twenty-first century as an urban issue affecting lower and middle-income households in cities, as a consequence of the financialization of housing and urban restructuring. It argues that the housing affordability concept has been repurposed such that the focus is less on understanding housing expenditures in contributing to poverty and disadvantage within the domain of social policy and more on the urban policy challenges of growing inequities in access to urban resources. The paper highlights the challenges for urban policy in adopting and adapting rather than rejecting a multi-dimensional concept of housing affordability and consequently the importance of new ways of measuring urban housing affordability."
"Measuring systemic risk and contagion in the European financial network Systemic Risk; Banking; Interbank Markets This paper introduces a novel framework to study default dependence and systemic risk in a financial network that evolves over time. We analyse several indicators of risk, and develop a new latent space model to assess the health of key European banks before, during and after the recent financial crises. We propose a new statistical model that permits a latent space visualisation of the financial system. This provides a clear and interpretable model-based summary of the interaction data, and it gives a new perspective on the topology structure of the network. Crucially, the methodology provides a new approach to assess and understand the systemic risk associated with a financial system, and to study how debt may spread between institutions. Our dynamic framework provides an interpretable map that illustrates the default dependencies between institutions, highlighting the possible patterns of contagion and the institutions that may pose systemic threats."
"Fame, What's your name? quasi and statistical gender discrimination in an art valuation experimentc Ethnic Discrimination; Job Applications; Field Experiment We conduct five experimental studies to examine whether and what kind of gender discrimination explains deep and persistent gender gaps in the art market. 1112 participants chose between male and female-originated artworks with and without artist information. Gender-specific artist names did not affect personal preferences or preference norms. They did however cause significant swings towards male artworks when participants were incentivised to guess the more pedigreed or more expensive artwork. When artist name information was controlled, manipulating artist fame information shifted preference norms towards artworks of males, who are more famous on average. Overall we find no taste-based but significant statistical gender discrimination. We also find quasi gender discrimination, in which discrimination based on a particular characteristic (fame) may be falsely attributed to a highly-correlated one (gender)."
"Students’ Workplace Readiness: Assessment and Skill-Building for Graduate Employability Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management This study introduces a new approach for the competence development of the socio-technical aspect. The curriculum of the Project Management (PM) course taught in degree programs concentrates largely on imparting technical knowledge. Current research seeks to direct the attention of the PM curriculum towards Personal Competencies as well. PM studies not only require a project to be carried out successfully but also expect students to demonstrate certain personal competencies, behaviors, and traits to effectively lead the project team. This research seeks to inform action and yield pertinent knowledge and instructional material around the desired personal competence. This study adopts an exploratory and (educational) action research approach with a quantitative mode of inquiry. The first of the four phases of this study comprises an action-based approach to find out which Personal Competence is essential for PM students. The second phase is of further follow-ups with the research subjects that indicate their lack of understanding of the PM personal competencies. The next phase employs a second survey showing that the Communication Skills of research subjects need work. The last phase offers a comprehensive training plan around the required competence, a training evaluation tool, a competence assessment exam, and tools for training and trainer feedback. The findings of this research bear immense implications for PM competence building and curriculum. The practical contribution of the study offers a way to prepare the graduates for ready employability."
"Comparative Flower Transcriptome Network Analysis Reveals DEGs Involved in Chickpea Reproductive Success during Salinity Cicer; Ascochyta; Genetic Variability Salinity is increasingly becoming a significant problem for the most important yet intrinsically salt-sensitive grain legume chickpea. Chickpea is extremely sensitive to salinity during the reproductive phase. Therefore, it is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms by comparing the transcriptomic dynamics between the two contrasting genotypes in response to salt stress. Chickpea exhibits considerable genetic variation amongst improved cultivars, which show better yields in saline conditions but still need to be enhanced for sustainable crop production. Based on previous extensive multi-location physiological screening, two identified genotypes, JG11 (salt-tolerant) and ICCV2 (salt-sensitive), were subjected to salt stress to evaluate their phenological and transcriptional responses. RNA-Sequencing is a revolutionary tool that allows for comprehensive transcriptome profiling to identify genes and alleles associated with stress tolerance and sensitivity. After the first flowering, the whole flower from stress-tolerant and sensitive genotypes was collected. A total of ~300 million RNA-Seq reads were sequenced, resulting in 2022 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to salt stress. Genes involved in flowering time such as FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and pollen development such as ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS), rho-GTPase, and pollen-receptor kinase were significantly differentially regulated, suggesting their role in salt tolerance. In addition to this, we identify a suite of essential genes such as MYB proteins, MADS-box, and chloride ion channel genes, which are crucial regulators of transcriptional responses to salinity tolerance. The gene set enrichment analysis and functional annotation of these genes in flower development suggest that they can be potential candidates for chickpea crop improvement for salt tolerance."
"Electrochemical performance and stability improvement of triclinic LiVOPO4 cathode material via simultaneous Y doping and YPO4 surface modification Carbon; Electrochemical Properties; Electrodes Here, we report the development of a facile approach in co-modification of triclinic lithium vanadyl phosphate [Îµ-LiVOPO4] with simultaneous yttrium (Y) doping and yttrium phosphate (YPO4) surface modification. Due to synergistic effects of YPO4 surface modification and Y doping, the resultant Îµ-LiVOPO4 (LVOP) exhibited significantly enhanced stability and electrochemical performance cycled in wide voltage 1.5â€“4.5 V. Among different proportions of Y (0, 3.5, 5, and 7 %), 5 % Y-doped sample (5 %Y-LVOP) exhibited the best electrochemical performance with a discharge capacity of 268 mAh gâˆ’1 at 0.1C and retained best cycling stability with capacity retention of 91 % after 40 cycles, showing stable high-voltage (4 V) performance with no capacity fade. The sample also showed best high-rate and long-term cycling stabilities with capacity retentions of 87 % after 40 cycles and 67 % after 200 cycles at relatively high current rates of 2C and 1C, respectively. Some of Y doped into LVOP expanded channels for Li-ion diffusion and resulted in improved ionic and electronic conductivity of 5 %Y-LVOP compared to pristine sample. In addition, YPO4 surface modification also improved cycling and thermal stability."
"Managing in a war zone: Somalian managers in the banking and mobile telecommunications sectors Resilience; Dynamic Capabilities; Organizational Culture Orientation: Management studies too often concentrate on supposedly normal market conditions in stable, developed countries. In reality, most forms of management are conducted in more trying circumstances, and this article seeks to expand knowledge of how it takes place under difficult conditions. Research purpose: This study explored management techniques under wartime conditions exhibited by managers in the banking and mobile telecommunications sectors in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. Motivation for the study: Somalia is a fragile state that risks failing its people in many ways, including security, food security and basic public services. One means of compensating for these failures is the private sectorâ€™s ability to organise not just business but essential public services when the government is unable to do so. This article studied whether that was taking place. Research approach/design and method: The research was qualitative in nature and featured in-depth, personal interviews with managers and executives in the identified sectors of interest. Respondents were identified through convenience and then purposive snowball sampling techniques. Main findings: It was found that adaptations to managing in wartime could be divided into three main themes: practical aspects of managing in adversity, coping mechanisms and the ethical issues involved in managing without a government. In general, in the absence of a legitimate ruling power or a form of market regulation, managers reverted to the pre-existing tribal system as a means not just of managing transactions but also to instil trust in those transactions. Practical/managerial implications: A model is provided for managing under wartime or similarly difficult situations, which might be adapted to other contexts. Contribution/value-add: This article extends knowledge of how management is conducted in wartime and how managers adapt to adverse conditions."
"Localisation of the Sustainable Development Goals in an emerging nation Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), agreed to by all member countries of the United Nations, require urgent action on the world's most pressing problems. Success requires bottom-up participation of local stakeholders. This case study of Timor-Lesteâ€”a fledgling, fossil fuel-supported economyâ€”maps the awareness and commitment of grassroots stakeholders to the SDGs and the roadblocks to localisation. Guiding this paper is Habermasâ€™ view of societal evolution and communicative action, which aids analysing the socio-political and structural dynamics affecting SDGs localisation in a developing nation. This study reveals stakeholder inability to articulate a clear vision for the SDGs, lack of human capital and funds, a weak public-administrative system, strong socio-political nuances, and poor governance infrastructure to support multi-stakeholder relationships. This paper provides insights for developing a more nuanced and robust public intervention to support local stakeholders that will enable knowledge, cultural and communication transformations required for successful SDGs localisation."
"Procurement Issues in Donor-Funded International Development Projects Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management This study investigated the critical procurement challenges faced by international development (ID) projects in Bangladesh. Initially, a framework of challenges was developed via literature review. We then ranked the importance of these challenges and categorized them based on interview data and analytical hierarchy processing analysis. Interviews were conducted with procurement experts from three major ID project stakeholder groups: donor organizations, host country government policymakers, and project implementation units. The most important categories of challenges were those related to project management capacity/capability, and ethics. More specifically, the challenges deemed most important were those related to improper project planning, undue practices in procurement implementation, government bureaucracy and interference in procurement, and inexperienced procurement staff. This paper contributes to the ID project procurement literature by identifying the critical challenges to procurement, which differ from those of other project-related areas. The findings may assist the multibillion-dollar ID project procurement industry in Bangladesh by highlighting the major issues that require effective management by all stakeholders. Ultimately, this may improve procurement outcomes and overall project performance."
"Closed Loop Food Production and the ‘Greening’ of Corrections Facilities: Using Composted Kitchen Waste for Fresh Food Production Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste Food represents a large proportion of putrescible waste in landfill in Australia, with very little food waste processed to recover resources. This has environmental impacts in the form of greenhouse gas generation and other externalities. Prisons typically waste high levels of food compared to the general community and, with the exception of a few small-scale and isolated composting examples in Australian prisons, the majority of prison food waste is sent to landfill. Internationally, especially in the U.S.A., the so-called â€˜greening of correctionsâ€™ has gained pace over the past few decades with the movement espousing similar objectives to certain United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. The literature suggests that prisoner participation in sustainability measures, environmental stewardship programs, landscape gardening and or agricultural/horticultural production decreases the chance of recidivism and is likely to improve the chance of post-release employment in the sustainability industry. As part of the greening of corrections, there are a number of examples of large-scale food waste composting operations used as the basis for significant, and often lucrative, fresh food production in prisons. Various U.S.A. prisons have demonstrated substantial waste disposal savings and further savings on fertilizers and fresh produce as a result of food waste composting processes. The types of food waste composting technologies and techniques utilised in these U.S.A. prisons, the savings in waste disposal fees and fertilizer costs, and the consequent food production could have beneficial impacts if modified for Australian conditions."
"Design, implementation and academic perspectives on authentic assessment for applied business higher education in a top performing Asian economy Supply Chain Management; Logistics; Management Research Purpose: The purpose of authentic assessment can enrich students with a set of skills that can have a significant impact on their employability. The key aim of these actions is to equip students with the practical skills to be work ready. The focus here is to demonstrate effects on student satisfaction and observations from teaching staff accrued over several semesters in an educational institution after introducing authentic assessments. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a set of scaffolded authentic assessments for students in logistics and supply chain management (LSCM). A combination of literature and expert input was used to design and implement the authentic assessment. A multi-phase systematic approach using cyclical model steps articulated the course learning outcomes (CLOs). Findings: Reinforced evidence that authentic assessments create options for divergent learners and provide opportunities for applying practical and higher-order cognitive skills in tertiary education system of an emerging economy. With the focus on student ability in doing things, students with diversified backgrounds and abilities in Asia can be encouraged to take an active role in their own learning. The formats of the newly redesigned assessments allow multidimensional cognitive capabilities such as art development (posters and video tasks) and reflective exercises. Importantly, formative types of authentic assessments help to decrease the level of anxiety by emphasising the aspect of doing and lead to better student satisfaction with the courses. All of these effects are shown to be repeatable in an Asian economy. Practical implications: Authentic assessments prepare students for the new world of work through a more focused scaffolding of their learning. Originality/value: Stimulation of deeper learning in tertiary education students is relevant for a top performing Asian economy."
"Cumulative Impacts of Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: Experimental Evidence from Indonesia Child Labor; Family Characteristic; School Attendance Conditional cash transfers provide income and promote human capital investments. Yet evaluating their longitudinal impacts is hard, as most experimental evaluations treat control locations after a few years. We examine such impacts in Indonesia after six years, where the program rollout left the experiment largely intact. We find static effects on many targeted indicators: childbirth using trained professionals increased dramatically, and under- 15 children not in school fell by half. We observe impacts requiring cumulative investments: stunting fell by 23 percent. While human capital accumulation increased, the transfers did not lead to transformative economic change for recipient households. (JEL I21, I38, J13, J24, O15)"
"Learning from success: A machine learning approach to guiding solar building envelope applications in non-domestic market Hot Temperature; Phase Change Materials; Photovoltaic System Solar building envelopes, also known as Building Integrated PV (BIPV) show significant growth in Asia and Europe, although other regions such as Australia are still lagging. The decision to uptake BIPV is complex due to the heterogeneous interest of adopters and multi-dimensional features. Instead of redesigning BIPV in hypothetical buildings, we built a machine learning model using a database of real BIPV and building-attached PV (BAPV) applications, for the purpose of learning and predicting a BIPV adoption decision-making in non-domestic buildings in western countries. We used Australia as a case study to execute the support vector machine (SVM) prediction model. It was revealed that the combination of project determinants such as geographical conditions, equivalent building materials, interest rates and capital cost influenced the decision of BIPV. The prediction model provides pieces of information for stakeholders across the BIPV ecosystem to take their decision on investment, policymaking, and research directions. The current global industry transformation and innovations in technology are favourable to politically promoting and investing in BIPV. Such promotion and investment would help both expand the current market and reach the greenhouse targets."
"Cohesive Diverse Suburbs in Australia: A Case Study of Policy Processes and Social Media in Footscray Cultural Diversity; Islam; Racism Melbourneâ€™s population is culturally superdiverse yet there is little focus on inclusiveness in diverse communities. This article will present a case study of Footscray, Melbourne, Australia, examining the following questions: How do government, service providers and civic organisations in Footscray work to build a more cohesive community? How does a local Facebook group work to create a more culturally cohesive community? The findings are based on fieldwork in a multicultural gentrifying inner suburb of Melbourne, and show that inclusion has a clear spatial component, while place-based social media can reinforce and enhance community participation of culturally diverse groups."
"Doctors’ and Nurses’ Attitudes of Acupuncture and Acupressure use in Perioperative Care: An Australian National Survey Complementary and Alternative Medicine; Alternative Medicine; Mind-Body Therapies Background: Acupuncture and acupressure are not being systematically used in the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain, despite being included in the guidelines. Aim: To examine the beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge of Australian nurses/midwives and doctors toward the perioperative use of AA for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain; to explore the barriers and enablers influencing acupuncture and acupressure integration into hospital setting. Methods: A mixed-mode approach was undertaken for data collection. An online approach was used to recruit respondents from Australian College of Perioperative Nurses. Three hospitals from three different Australian states were selected via convenience sampling. Results: A total of 421 usable surveys were included in data analysis. The respondents comprised 14.3% doctors and 72.9% nurses/midwives. Overall, 69.4% were female, 85% were trained in Australia with 35% and 51.4% having knowledge or personal exposure to AA in general respectively. Over 60% of the respondents agreed AA should be routinely integrated into perioperative care, and over 80% would recommend AA to their patients if it was provided at their hospital, and, 75% would be willing to receive further education. The three main reported barriers included: perceived lack of scientific evidence (80.9%), unavailability of credentialed provider (77.2%) and lack of reimbursement (60.4%). Conclusions: Positive attitudes are reported by Australian doctors and nurses toward AA. This is despite of low levels of knowledge or personal exposure to AA. Further studies are required to explore the implementation of barriers and address respondent calls for further education."
"Developing data capability with non-profit organisations using participatory methods Evaluation Capacity Building; Program Evaluation; Evaluator In this paper, we explore the methodologies underpinning two participatory research collaborations with Australian non-profit organisations that aimed to build data capability and social benefit in data use. We suggest that studying and intervening in data practices in situ, that is, in organisational data settings expands opportunities for improving the social value of data. These situated and collaborative approaches not only address the â€˜expertise lagâ€™ for non-profits but also help to realign the potential social value of organisational data use. We explore the relationship between data literacy, data expertise and data capability to test the idea that collaborative work with non-profit organisations can be a practical step towards addressing data equity and generating data-driven social outcomes. Rather than adopting approaches to data literacy that focus on individuals â€“ or ideal â€˜data citizensâ€™ â€“ we target the organisation-wide data settings, goals and practices of the non-profit sector. We conclude that participatory methods can embed social value-generating data capability where it can be sustained at an organisational level, aligning with community needs to promote collaborative data action."
"The Production of Employment Conditions for Migrant Care Workers: Cross National Perspectives Long-Term Care; Carework; Personnel There is widespread scholarly recognition that migrant long-term care (LTC) workers experience relatively poorer work conditions than local LTC workers. We focus here on the ways in which migration and employment regulation intersect in formal LTC markets to produce working conditions for migrant workers. Drawing on cross-national comparisons between Australia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom we explore: firstly, the forms of employment regulation that can protect migrant LTC workers or expose them to additional risks; and secondly, how migration regulation can work to amplify employment protection gaps for certain groups of migrant workers. We find that while historically there have been better employment protections in Australia and the Netherlands, the reshaping of work in all three LTC systems creates a context within which migration regulation can exacerbate the risks of precarious work for migrant workers and for those on temporary visas in particular."
"The toxicity and valorization options of cigarette butts Tobacco; Smoking; Leachates Cigarette butts, one of the most abundant forms of waste in the world, contain more than 4000 toxic chemicals and pose serious risks to the health of wildlife, humans, and marine and freshwater organisms. Although trivial in size, trillions of cigarettes are produced every year worldwide, resulting in the accumulation of tonnes of toxic waste litter. In 2016, a world production of over 5.7 trillion cigarettes was reported with the majority comprising cellulose acetate filters â€“ a polymer with poor biodegradability. Depending on the environmental conditions, cellulose acetate filters can take up to 10 years to decompose during which time they leach heavy metals and toxic chemicals into the environment. Although possible disposal methods for collected cigarette butt waste include incineration and landfilling, both techniques may result in the release of hazardous fumes and can be costly. However, recycling CBs in different materials could be a possible solution for this concurrent environmental pollution. A number of novel studies have been publicized on recycling cigarette butts with encouraging results, and several methods have been studied, including recycling of cigarette butts in asphalt concrete and fired clay bricks, as a carbon source, sound absorbing material, corrosion inhibitor, biofilm carrier, and many more. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive review and discussion of various studies that have been carried out on the toxicity and valorization of cigarette butt waste and investigates the feasibility and sustainability of recycling methods adopted. Further research and developments are essential for the widespread application of recycling cigarette butts."
"Service design for social change: reflections on teaching human-centred design in an undergraduate social work degree Participatory Design; Co-Design; Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Human Centred Design (HCD) is emerging in Australia as a participatory approach to service design in social work and human services organisations. In this article, we reflect upon our incorporation of HCD into a core unit offered to final-year students in a Bachelor of Social Work (Honours) degree, as part of a collaboration between design and social work academics. We highlight successes and challenges, and identify adaptations that can provide HCD with a stronger strength-based, critical approach that better aligns with critical social work education. We provide suggestions for social work practitioners and educators around implementing HCD, in ways that inspire critical and reflexive thinking, promote social justice and focus on designing for progressive, structural and social change."
"New contextualised perspectives: Using bluetooth beacons and drones for mixed-reality storytelling Emotion; Digital Texts; Instant Messaging The ubiquity of smartphones has led to a shift in the way that content is created and consumed. This shift allows media makers to tell mixed-reality documentary stories that are highly contextualised to various places and that offer new perspectives on those places, thereby creating exciting, new contexts and auratic experiences. This chapter offers an insight into the creation of such projects by using a practice-based research approach to examine the development of a mobile walking tour app in partnership with Winda Mara Aboriginal Corporation in western Victoria, Australia. The app augments the Tyrendarra Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) to provide visitors with a glimpse of Gunditjmara culture and history, including its prominence in Australian Indigenous knowledge as ""one of Australia's earliest and largest aquaculture ventures"" (Victorian Department of the Environment, Tyrendarra indigenous protected area, 2003)."
"Gender crime convergence over twenty years: Evidence from Australia Property Crime Rate; Crime; Deterrence Historically men have been responsible for the majority of criminal activity and dominate prison populations around the globe. The twentieth century witnessed significant maleâ€“female convergence in a myriad of positive dimensions including human capital acquisition, labour force participation and wages. This has prompted the question, to what extent are women â€˜looking more like menâ€™? In this paper we examine whether similar forces are at play in the context of criminality. We study the pattern of gender convergence in crime using rich administrative data on the population of young people in Queensland, Australia. The evidence points to a significant narrowing of the gender gap in criminal activity over the course of the last twenty years. Crime convergence occurs for broad aggregates of both property and violent crime, as well as for almost all sub-component categories. Convergence occurs largely because crime has fallen significantly for men, combined with no downward trend for women. This is confirmed by aggregate analysis of rates of offending in police force districts matched to Census data by gender between 2001 and 2016."
"Performance analysis of clustering methods for balanced multi-robot task allocations Task Allocation; Multi-Robot; Robot This paper models the Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem with a balance constraint to improve the utilisation (completion time) of the robots. Our balancing constraint attempts to minimise the travel distance difference among the robots as well as allocates an equal set of tasks to these robots. The clustering-based approach is employed to solve the Balanced Multi-Robot Task Allocation (BMRTA) problem for two principal reasons. That is, this approach clusters given tasks into groups using various clustering techniques for each robot and sequences the route for each robot using the travelling salesman problem (TSP) conhull algorithm. This work analyses the suitability and performance of the clustering techniques with respect to the balancing criteria using a benchmark dataset. Our findings suggest that K-means clustering is the most suitable for the solving BMRTA problem with complex topologies and it is scalable to deal with any number of tasks and robots compared with Gaussian Mixtures Models (GMM) and hierarchical clustering methods."
"Shaping the Housing Grey Zone: An Australian Retirement Villages Case Study Home Ownership; Housing Wealth; Real Estate Market Housing options for an ageing, predominantly home-owning society have evolved within the shifting context of social, economic, policy and locally-specific property conditions. Drawing on a case study of the retirement housing industry in Victoria, this paper finds that actor groups from overlapping aged care and housing agencies, from not-for-profit and for-profit sectors, have continuously redefined taken-for-granted housing â€œproblemsâ€ of old age and developed solutions. The paper contributes to understanding the ideas and conditions that have shaped the retirement housing industry, and contributes theoretically to research that seeks to understand how ideas about housing and ageing are built into institutional arrangements."
"Shear Containment of BDNF within Molecular Hydrogels Promotes Human Stem Cell Engraftment and Postinfarction Remodeling in Stroke Scaffold; Schwann Cells; Chondroitin ABC Lyase Improved control over spatiotemporal delivery of growth factors is needed to enhance tissue repair. Current methods are limitedâ€“requiring invasive procedures, poor tissue targeting, and/or limited control over dosage and duration. Incorporation into implantable biomaterials enables stabilized delivery and avoids burst release/fluctuating doses. Here, the physical forces of fibrils formed by self-assembly of epitope-containing peptides are exploited. This biomimetic hydrogel is loaded with neurotrophic factor BDNF via a shear-induced gelâ€“solution transition, unique to noncovalent hydrogels. This results in a biomaterial with three desirable features: a nanofibrillar scaffold, presentation of a laminin epitope, and slow release of BDNF. In a stroke-injury model, synergistic actions of this trimodal strategy on the integration of transplanted human neural progenitor cells, and protection of peri-infarct tissue are identified. These BDNF-functionalized hydrogels promote the integration of transplanted human embryonic stem cellâ€“derived neural progenitorsâ€“resulting in larger grafts with greater cortical differentiation, appropriate for neuronal replacement. Furthermore, BDNF promotes the infiltration of host endothelial cells into the graft to augment vascularization of the graft, and adjacent penumbra tissue. These findings demonstrate the benefits of multifaceted tissue-specific hydrogels to provide biomimetics of the host tissue, while sustain protein delivery, to promote endogenous and graft-derived tissue repair."
"Social inequalities in mobility during and following the COVID-19 associated lockdown of the Madrid metropolitan area in Spain ARIMA; Mathematical Modeling; COVID-19 Spain has been one of the most affected regions by the COVID-19 worldwide, and Madrid its most affected city. In response to this, the Spanish government enacted a strict lockdown in late March 2020, that was gradually eased until June 2020. We explored differentials in mobility by area-level deprivation in the functional area of Madrid, before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. We used cell phone-derived mobility indicators (% of the population leaving their area) from the National Institute of Statistics (INE), and a composite measure of deprivation from the Spanish Society of Epidemiology (SEE). We computed changes in mobility with respect to pre-pandemic levels, and explored spatial patterns and associations with deprivation. We found that levels of mobility before COVID-19 were slightly higher in areas with lower deprivation. The economic hibernation period resulted in very strong declines in mobility, most acutely in low deprivation areas. These differences weakened during the re-opening, and levels of mobility were similar by deprivation once the lockdown was completely lifted. Given the existence of important socioeconomic differentials in COVID-19 exposure, it is key to ensure that these interventions do not widen existing social inequalities."
"Suitability Prediction and Enhancement of Future Water Supply Systems in Barwon Region in Victoria, Australia Environmental Assessment; Landscape Fragmentation; China Intensive agricultural production accompanied by the climate change impacts in postColonial rural landscapes have continuously increased the demand for water resources and coastal areas, showing an unprecedented water supply crisis. By taking extreme weather conditions and rainfall events for future trends, a resilient water storage facility for the landscape requires the collaborative approach of natural systems and simulation modelling techniques to develop sustainable future scenarios. In this study, an ecological suitability model is used to identify potential sites for the construction of multi-purpose dams. As part of the model structure, multi factors are classified using the patterns of changing landscapes, and then weighted overlay analysis is conducted on a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. Compared to previous studies, this paper derives its principal impact parameters and projections based on historical land cover information. The suitability maps that are generated visually guide the geographical location of the multi-purpose dams and indicate the areas from highly suitable to least suitable, clarifying the possibility of building blue infrastructure alongside the waterways in west-central Barwon. The workflow proposes a resilient water system based on existing land characteristics and measures that future water storage capacity will be a valid increase of approximately 1.5 times. This strategy alleviates water scarcity during the dry season to benefit traditional agricultural activities. Digital calculations are utilized to demonstrate the feasibility of the experimental results, providing a methodology for regulating the distribution and supply of river flows throughout the year while retaining runoff in a hierarchical pattern at precipitation periods."
"Internet of Things and autonomous control for vertical cultivation walls towards smart food growing: A review Green Roofs; Hot Temperature; Sedum Acre The development of green spaces in urban areas is rapidly on the rise as more people are keen to maintain a clean and green atmosphere around where they live and work. Also, the link between the physical world and the internet has been a driving force in enhancing people's quality of life which has resulted in the most recent and rising technologies, collectively referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). The adoption of vertical gardens (VG) and/or vertical farms (VF) can be beneficial for maintaining a sustainable environment, as well as for expanding food security in an urban context around the world with limited land space. IoT technologies have the potential to be key enablers in the accelerated adoption of VG. In this study, we investigate the critical parameters for automating sustainable vertical gardening systems by using the IoT concept in smart cities towards smart living. This involves collection and review of data from 30 peer-reviewed publications published between 2004 and 2018, including real-world VG implementations. The key criteria considered include: (i) crop/plant type, (ii) VG topology (size), (iii) sensing data, (iv) used hardware (sensors, actuators, etc.), (v) power supplies, (vi) velocity or frequency of data collection, (vii) data storage method, (viii) communication technologies, (ix) data analysis methods/algorithm, (x) other used strategies, and (xi) countries that implemented VGs. The data were subsequently analyzed to obtain a detailed understanding of using IoT in VGs. The results of the analysis revealed that most of the studies used 6-20 tiers (40%) when implementing VGs, and the most popular crop was lettuce (28.6%). The sensors used were commonly connected to AC power and battery (each 44.4%), while only a small proportion of VGs used solar power (11.1%). The majority of IoT sensors used were to measure room temperature (22.5%), light intensity (21.1%), humidity level (14%) and soil nutrition (7%). The frequency of data collection by these sensors was between 1 and 3 minutes (42.8%). The frequently used data transmission technology was Zigbee and Wi-Fi (42.8%) for collecting sensor data from VGs. We also found that, using the server database, remote data management platform and cloud were the most popular data storage methods (each 25%). After data collection, many studies used threshold-based algorithms (50%) for the decision making, and the soil-based (42%) and hydroponic (38%) were the most popular plant cultivation technologies. The use of recycled and reused water (30%), solar power (20%) and controlled indoor environment, without sun or soil (20%) are some of the other essential considerations in VGs. Furthermore, it was found that the most significant focus on automation of VGs incorporating IoT were in USA (41.2%) and China (23.5%). The impact of vertical cultivation walls on human well-being was discussed. In addition to this, eight international patents on VGs have been analyzed to acquire an implementation understanding of autonomous control or using IoT in vertical gardens."
"Petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in terrestrial ecosystems—fate and microbial responses Biodegradation; Peptococcaceae; Benzylsuccinate Petroleum hydrocarbons represent the most frequent environmental contaminant. The introduction of petroleum hydrocarbons into a pristine environment immediately changes the nature of that environment, resulting in reduced ecosystem functionality. Natural attenuation represents the single, most important biological process which removes petroleum hydrocarbons from the environment. It is a process where microorganisms present at the site degrade the organic contaminants without the input of external bioremediation enhancers (i.e., electron donors, electron acceptors, other microorganisms or nutrients). So successful is this natural attenuation process that in environmental biotechnology, bioremediation has developed steadily over the past 50 years based on this natural biodegradation process. Bioremediation is recognized as the most environmentally friendly remediation approach for the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from an environment as it does not require intensive chemical, mechanical, and costly interventions. However, it is under-utilized as a commercial remediation strategy due to incomplete hydrocarbon catabolism and lengthy remediation times when compared with rival technologies. This review aims to describe the fate of petroleum hydrocarbons in the environment and discuss their interactions with abiotic and biotic components of the environment under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, the mechanisms for dealing with petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in the environment will be examined. When petroleum hydrocarbons contaminate land, they start to interact with its surrounding, including physical (dispersion), physiochemical (evaporation, dissolution, sorption), chemical (photo-oxidation, auto-oxidation), and biological (plant and microbial catabolism of hydrocarbons) interactions. As microorganism (including bacteria and fungi) play an important role in the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons, investigations into the microbial communities within contaminated soils is essential for any bioremediation project. This review highlights the fate of petroleum hydrocarbons in tertial environments, as well as the contributions of different microbial consortia for optimum petroleum hydrocarbon bioremediation potential. The impact of high-throughput metagenomic sequencing in determining the underlying degradation mechanisms is also discussed. This knowledge will aid the development of more efficient, cost-effective commercial bioremediation technologies."
"Fe oxides-biochar composites produced by hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis of biomass waste Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon The synthesis of biochar-metal oxide composites for removing heavy metals from aqueous solutions or remediating polluted soils has attracted increased attention. Amongst them, Fe oxide composites stand out due to possible magnetic properties and low price. Two types of Fe oxide-biochar composites were prepared by impregnation with ferric sulfate salts of biomass waste or corresponding hydrochar, followed by pyrolysis at 550 Â°C for 5 h. During pyrolysis, Fe increased carbonization, leading to biochar with low H/C values. Properties of Fe oxide-biochar composite greatly depend on the feedstock. The Fe content in the final Fe oxide-biochar was higher than in biochar obtained by direct pyrolysis of biomass waste. Some of Fe was in the form of FeS. Impregnation of hydrochar followed by pyrolysis lead to a Fe oxide-biochar composite with lower ash content and higher micro- and macro-porosity. In this case, the Fe was in the form of Fe oxides."
"Evaluating Student Engagement and Deep Learning in Interactive Online Psychology Learning Activities Distance Education; Social Presence; Online Discussion There is growing demand for online learning activities that offer flexibility for students to study anywhere, anytime, as online students fit study around work and family commitments. We designed a series of online activities and evaluated how, where and with what devices students used the activities, as well as their levels of engagement and deep learning with the activities. A mixed-methods design was used to explore studentsâ€™ interactions with the online activities. This method integrated learning analytics data with responses from 63 survey respondents, nine interviews and 16 focus group participants. We found that students used a combination of mobile devices to access the online learning activities across a variety of locations during opportunistic study sessions in order to fit study into their daily routines. The online activities were perceived positively, facilitating affective, cognitive, and behavioural engagement as well as stimulating deep learning. Activities that were authentic, promoted problem-solving, applied theory to real-life scenarios and increased studentsâ€™ feelings of being supported were perceived as most beneficial to learning. These findings have implications for the future design of online activities, where activities need to accommodate studentsâ€™ need for flexibility as studentsâ€™ study habits become more mobile."
"Hydrothermal carbonization of oil palm trunk via taguchi method Hydrothermal Carbonization; Hydrochars; Carbon Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and its parameters show a significant role in the quality of HTC products and the distribution of yield. The present study investigates the optimal conditions that are suitable to produce maximum yield products of solid, liquid, and gas, from HTC of oil palm trunk (OPT), by following the Taguchi method. Moreover, all the three products of HTC were analyzed using various characterizations. The optimum runs for hydrochar yield, liquid yield, and gaseous yield were run 1 (R1), run 4 (R4), and run 9 (R9), respectively. The reaction temperature was found to be the most influential parameter that affected the yield distribution during HTC, where low temperature supported solid production, intermediate temperatures favored liquid yield, and high temperature produced higher gaseous yield. Elemental analysis, H/C and O/C atomic ratios, higher heating value (HHV), and energy density values of hydrochar recommended that the HTC process has significantly converted OPT into better energy fuel. The energy densification value of hydrochar ranged between 1.28 and 1.40, which confirmed the significance of the HTC process. Two characteristic peaks from FTIR were observed at 3,430 cmâˆ’1 and 2,923 cmâˆ’1 hydrochar. SEM analysis confirmed that the porosity of hydrochar was higher than OPT after HTC. However, the major organic matter in the bio-oil traced by GC-MS analysis was acetic acid, accounting for about 59.9â€“71.7%, and the outlet gaseous product consisted of 0.87â€“9.17% CH4, 3.88â€“29.02% CO2, 1.07â€“7.89% CO, and 0.31â€“1.97% H2, respectively, as shown by GC-TCD."
"Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic cuttlebone with an inherent lamellar structure for continuous and effective oil spill cleanup Water; Hydrophobicity; Aerogels Oil wastes pose an enormous threat to aquatic ecosystems, and environmental and economic demands emphasize the importance of affordable and sustainable oil absorbents. To tackle this issue, we propose the repurposing of abundant and low-cost cuttlebone from the ocean to address oil spills for the ocean. By the simple, successive deposition of polydopamine and a mixture of fluorinated silica nanoparticles and polydimethylsiloxane, the ultralight, porous, and mechanically stable cuttlebone is endowed with excellent superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity. The as-obtained cuttlebone exhibits high absorption performance for various hydrocarbons and is successfully applied in a series of oil/water mixture separations. On this basis, an oil-collecting â€œcephalopodâ€ electric device is designed by combining superhydrophobic/superoleophilic cuttlebone with a pumping system, and demonstrates excellent collection efficiency and recyclability for oil spill cleanup. This work provides a valuable perspective on the development of high-performance oil absorbents derived from sustainable natural marine products."
"Pure Land UNWIRED: New approaches to virtual reality for heritage at risk Virtual Reality; Methodology; Locomotion The Mogao Grottoes located in Gansu Province of north-western China consist of 492 cells and cave sanctuaries carved into the cliffs above the Dachuan River in Mogao. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, they comprise the largest, most richly endowed, and oldest treasure house of Buddhist art in the world. However, for preservation and conservation reasons most of the caves are now closed to the public. This chapter discusses the range of technologies currently available for the virtual representation of Cave 220, just one of the many caves located at this site. In particular, the chapter focuses on the latest prototype, developed by the authors called Pure Land UNWIRED which uses a virtual reality platform specifically designed for a unique single user full-body immersive virtual reality experience. The discussion includes technical and evaluative analysis of this prototype."
"University buildings: The push and pull for sustainability Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Universities are a key stakeholder in our built environment with buildings in many major cities around Australia and the world. Due to their primarily urban locations, size and number of staff and students, universities and their activities are a significant contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. Increasingly universities both in Australia and globally are looking for ways to improve their sustainability outcomes. This recognizes that higher education institutions can do more to help in the transition to a low-carbon future, but also that by adopting sustainability initiatives, universities help reduce operating costs and facilitate healthier and more productive staff and students. This chapter explores the role of universities and their sustainability initiatives including their challenges of servicing complex stakeholders in a transition to a low-carbon future. After discussing relevant policies and rating tools, five key examples that go significantly beyond minimum performance requirements from prominent Australian universities are presented. Evident from the examples is that there continues to be no one-size-fits-all approach for universities to become more sustainable. It will require complex considerations of the requirements of the university anticipated future needs as well as a wide-ranging evaluation of the most appropriate pathways forward. Ultimately, it is encouraging to see key universities engaging more seriously with improving sustainability outcomes, not only in Australia but also globally. Universities have the opportunity to not just improve sustainability of their facilities, but to also demonstrate to their hundreds of thousands of students and staff how the built environment can be designed to benefit both the environment and the occupants."
"Temporal and spatial variations of microplastics in roadside dust from rural and urban Victoria, Australia: Implications for diffuse pollution Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Microplastic pollution is an important issue for environmental management as their ubiquity in marine and freshwaters has been confirmed. Pollution sources are key to understanding how microplastics travel from land to open oceans. Given that information regarding microplastic transport from diffuse sources is limiting, we conducted a study on roadside dust from rural and urban Victoria, Australia, over two seasons. Any deposited fugitive dust and particulate matter may also be present in our samples. The average microplastic abundance over two seasons ranged from 20.6 to 529.3 items/kg (dry weight based), with a predominant portion of fibers and items less than 1 mm. Polyester and polypropylene were the dominant polymer types (26%) while cotton and cellulose were the most common non-plastic items (27%). Sampling sites displayed consistent microplastic abundances over time and shared similar patterns in size, shape and polymer composition. Multiple correlation and principal component analysis suggest that urbanization and rainfall are important influences to roadside microplastic accumulation. The observed microplastic hotspots were generally located within close vicinity of areas where urban intensive land use and regional population sizes are high. Microplastics accumulated on roads and road verges during periods of dry weather and were flushed away during heavy storms while the corresponding trigger value was unknown. Monitoring roadside dust can be considered as an initial and cost-effective screening of microplastic pollution in urban areas. Further efforts should be made to optimize the methodologies and we advocate prolonged sampling schemes for roadside dust monitoring. Urbanization and weather conditions are major factors to microplastic accumulation by roadsides."
"Novel antibacterial polyurethane and cellulose acetate mixed matrix membrane modified with functionalized TiO2 nanoparticles for water treatment applications Polyethersulfone; Membrane; Ultrafiltration Bacterial contamination is one of the leading causes of water pollution. Antibacterial polyurethane/cellulose acetate membranes modified by functionalized TiO2 nanoparticles were processed and studied. TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared and ultraviolet (UV) irradiated to activate their photocatalytic activity against Escherichia coli (E. Coil) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria. Functionalized TiO2 nanoparticles were incorporated in flat-sheet mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). These membranes were characterized for their different properties such as morphology, thermal stability, mechanical strength, surface wettability, water retention, salt rejection, water flux, and their antibacterial performance against E. Coil and MRSA was also tested. The activity of nanoparticles against MRSA and E. coli was analyzed using three different concentrations, 0.5 wt%, 1.0 wt% and 1.5 wt% of nanoparticles and 0.5 wt% of TiO2 nanoparticles showed maximum growth of bacteria. The maximum inhibition was observed in membranes with maximum nanoparticles when compared with other membranes. All these characteristics were strongly affected by increasing the concentration of TiO2 nanoparticles in the prepared membranes and the duration of their UV exposure. Hence, it was proved from this analysis that these TiO2 modified membranes exhibit substantial antibacterial properties. The results are supporting the utilization of these materials for water purification purposes."
"Factors affecting the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices: Findings from panel data for Vietnam Agriculture; Indo-Gangetic Plain; Tillage Conventional farming and climate change are placing considerable stress on agricultural systems around the world, leading to increased hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, particularly in developing countries. Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) can help raise productivity and agricultural incomes while minimising negative environmental impacts. While recognising that sustainability is a contested term, we identify agricultural practices that are generally viewed as sustainable as they minimise impacts on the environment. Despite the benefits of SAPs, adoption rates are still low in developing countries. While previous studies have examined the factors affecting SAP adoption, most have not accounted for issues of heterogeneity and endogeneity inherent in such analysis. In this paper, we address this by employing a random-effects probit model with the Mundlak approach and fixed-effects linear probability models to control for farmer- and plot-level heterogeneities and to avoid the incidental parameters problem. We analyse panel data from Vietnam for approximately 14,000 plots over the period 2008â€“2016 to identify the factors behind SAP adoption. Overall, we find that improved knowledge transferred by extension agents and learning from peers significantly influence adoption. Farmers' knowledge of their land and soil quality are also important factors. We recommend enhancing cooperation between extension agents, farmer groups and peers in order to encourage SAP adoption."
"How New Zealand migrants fare in Australia: what explains their wealth gap? Labour Market Integration; Emigrants and Immigrants; Earnings Gap This paper investigates net wealth of the New Zealand-born (NZ-born) migrants relative to that of Australia-born, and other migrants in Australia. We consider how the free cross-border labour movement between Australia and New Zealand affects the wealth accumulating behaviour of NZ migrants. Our findings indicate that the NZ-born have lower net wealth than both the Australia-born and other migrants. The net wealth differential between the NZ- and Australia-born is mainly explained by the structure effect than from the composition effect (due to differences in observed characteristics, which are similar in both groups). In contrast, comparing with other migrants, the contribution of observed characteristics such as education, age, household composition, weekly wage, and long-term health conditions dominates the overall NZ-bornâ€™s net wealth differentials."
"Persistence of gender inequality: the role of ethnic divisions China; Institutional Quality; Multicultural Diversity Gender inequality remains a fundamental challenge for global policymakers given that it has detrimental implications for growth and human capital formation. However, studies examining the roots of gender inequality, and what determines the level of inequality are relatively scant. In this study, we seek to contribute to the literature that examines the roots of gender inequality and thus, our objective is to examine the impact of ethnic diversity on gender inequality. We argue that the level of ethnic diversity within a country plays a role in either deepening or bridging gender gaps. Using indices of ethnic fractionalization, we examine the effects of ethnic diversity on measures of gender inequality such as the gender inequality index, and its associated dimensions of empowerment, educational attainment and labour market outcomes. Our evidence suggests that ethnic diversity widens existing gender gaps. We discuss several mechanisms through which ethnic diversity may lead to the increase of existing gender gaps, and lay out various policy approaches to address gender inequality."
"Multi-objective optimisation for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) roof projects in early design phase Hot Temperature; Phase Change Materials; Photovoltaic System Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is an excellent renewable energy application for building envelopes. In Australia, BIPV roofing is considered to be promising because of recent major concerns about fire risks of faÃ§ades. However, the integration of PV into building envelope elements is a complicated process which, if not done properly, may lead to failure of the BIPV system. Therefore, feasible BIPV design solutions need to be examined in terms of life-cycle cost and energy performance from the early design phase of a BIPV envelope project. There have been few investigations of the identification of feasible BIPV design options in the early design phase to enable product selection and parametric tests. This study explores a multi-objective optimization method which formulates feasible BIPV envelope design options which have relatively high energy generation and low life cycle costs to informed decision making. The optimisation process has four segments: data inputs, simulator, optimizer and pareto front based optimised BIPV solutions. The proposed multi- objective optimization process is applied in a BIPV roof application using a case study in Australia with roof sheets and skylights. The results demonstrate seven optimum roof sheet BIPV design solutions and fourteen optimum skylight BIPV design solutions to enable design makers to compare and select the most appropriate. The life cycle cost, life cycle energy, CO2 emissions avoided, net present value, payback period, and levelized cost of energy of BIPV solutions vary based on the BIPV modules, tilt angles and placement locations. The proposed optimization method is a helpful guide for BIPV design professionals to identify suitable BIPV design options in the early design phase instead of relying on rule-of-thumb experience."
"Internalizing animals and ecosystems in social citizenship and social policy: From political community to political country Environmental Justice; Injustice; Air Quality The aim of this editorial is to explore, conceptualize, and research the need to internalize both animals and ecosystems in our understanding of social citizenship and social policy. This editorial should be seen as a brief overview of the themes that should be covered in the contributions to the Special Issue, â€œInternalizing Animals and Ecosystems in Social Citizenship and Social Policy: From Political Community to Political Countryâ€. This Special Issue argues the importance of integrating animals and ecosystems as a way to reâ€politicize humansâ€™ social relation with both animals and our ecosystem as in sustainable development and social policy. If environmental policy becomes social policy, we would reâ€construct social citizenship to include consideration for animals and ecosystems as integral part of social policy. This expansion in scope is a progression from seeing humans as part of a political community to becoming more involved in their political country. This aligns with the concept of Countryâ€”an allâ€encompassing term in Australia, involving a peopleâ€™s territory, land, water, biological resources, the complex obligations and relationships involved."
"Urban forest governance and decision-making: A systematic review and synthesis of the perspectives of municipal managers Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Empirical research on the views of municipal managers can provide insights into urban forest governance and decision-making. However, current research is fragmented across a diversity of case studies using a variety of methods. To address this issue, we undertook a systematic review and synthesis of empirical studies based on the views of municipal managers. We extracted information on the concerns, priorities, factors, and actors that influence municipal manager decision-making using a governance framework to extract ideas on the discourses, actors, rules, and resources that influence their decision-making. Out of >1400 articles found in searches, only 60 were relevant empirical studies, with 32 of them based in the US. Most studies elicited views from managers using pre-determined surveys/questionnaires. This literature is focused heavily on themes of resources, such as budgets and personnel, as important influences in program performance and urban forest success. Themes related to coordination of actors, such as the coordination of departmental units, were also frequently mentioned but were not explicitly associated with program performance or urban forest success. Future research aimed at gaining insights on urban forest governance and decision-making from the perspective of municipal managers will benefit from distinguishing operational capacities (i.e., budgets, personnel) from management processes (i.e., coordination), and focus on how municipal managers understand, facilitate, and find support in management processes. This will reveal how they implement co-governance and collaborative decision-making. Future research could better extend the knowledge base of existing studies by establishing clear governance frameworks and methods based on the views of managers."
"Factors influencing intention to adopt ICT among intensive shrimp farmers Shrimp Culture; Farmers; Aquaculture Intensive shrimp production has been considered one way to increase output quantity. However, many factors need to be considered to maintain product quality, sustained practice, and environmental compliance. The adoption of monitoring technologies in shrimp farming such as monitoring important water quality parameters including temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and salinity, offers several benefits, including increasing farming processes and cost efficiency and reducing harmful environmental impacts. A sampled survey dataset comprising 184 shrimp farmers from Ca Mau, Kien Giang, and Soc Trang provinces in Vietnam, one of the world largest shrimp producers, was used to examine factors that affect farmers' adoption of aquaculture information and communication technologies (ICT). The study empirically tested an adoption model using technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior under perceived production risks. Results suggest that farmers who both perceive the ICT as being useful in their shrimp farms and are influenced by other important peers are more likely to adopt aquaculture technologies. Farmers who feel confident to learn a new technology are likely to find the technology easier to use than someone who is not as confident. Due to the inherent risky nature of intensive shrimp production, even if Vietnamese shrimp farmers perceive a high level of technology-adoption risk, they still feel more confident towards learning to use a new ICT and its usefulness, and are therefore likely to increase their adoption. The study's results suggest ICT service providers should collaborate with local aquaculture departments to develop pilot farms to showcase new aquaculture technologies and demonstrate key features and their compatibility with existing farms' infrastructure, which will consequently entice farmers to quickly adopt shrimp monitoring technologies."
"Collective Energy Security, Economic Prosperity and Mitigation of Climate Change in South Asia Ganges River; Bangladesh; Road Traffic Noise Affordable access to energy and power is vital for economic and human development, industrialization, and poverty alleviation. Over 20% of South Asia's population does not have access to power, resulting in immense economic growth and prosperity deprivation. The limited endowment of locally available energy resources; varied financial and technological capabilities among South Asian nations greatly restrict their efficient and sustainable power generation and utilization capacity. Containment of energy resources, mismatch of power generation, and user locations due to cross-border non-collaboration have created inefficient uses of limited locally available energy and power. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to review current power generation capacities, available energy resources (conventional and renewable), potential cross-border collaboration in power trade and exchange, and collective investment in sustainable power generation in South Asian nations."
"Sustainable development carbon pricing initiative and voluntary environmental disclosures quality Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Although corporate environmental disclosures have been researched extensively, empirical evidence regarding the indirect impact of carbon pricing on firms' voluntary disclosures is scarce. The objective of this study is to identify the indirect impact of carbon pricing initiatives on the voluntary environmental disclosures (VEDs) of electricity generating companies, analyzed through the lens of institutional theory. This study adds to the growing literature on the determinants of VED, investigating the impact of adoption of the Global Reporting Initiative and ISO 14001 on VED. Secondary data were collected from 2015 annual reports and/or standalone sustainability reports of electricity generating companies from 53 countries around the world. Content analysis approach was adopted for measuring the extent of the quality of VED. Findings of multiple regression analysis suggest that there is an indirect institutional impact of carbon pricing on the quality of VED. This study also finds that, as the form of nongovernment guidance, the Global Reporting Initiative adoption and ISO 14001 certification also have an institutional influence on the VED. VED is also affected by company size although this study reveals no significant relationship of leverage with VED."
"Preventing child sexual abuse: A systematic review of interventions and their efficacy in developing countries Adverse Childhood Experiences; Maltreatment; Child Abuse Background: Research on prevalence, risk factors, and prevention interventions for child sexual abuse has continued to focus on western and developed countries. Where country-level prevalence data or large-scale research exists, rates of child sexual abuse are consistently higher in developing and non-western countries than their western and developed counterparts. Objective: We systematically reviewed research on the nature of child sexual abuse interventions in developing countries, the settings and populations included to identify types of child sexual abuse prevention initiatives being implemented in developing countries and their effectiveness. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of six databases and identified eight studies to include in our analysis. Results: Most empirically evaluated interventions in developing countries have focused on preschool and primary school-aged children. Most have focused on interventions delivered in educational settings, with a lack of focus on population-level interventions to prevent child sexual abuse. Researchers have used outcomes measuring knowledge or skills for young people in self-protection and help-seeking, not deployment of those skills, actual reduction in prevalence of CSA, or improvements in conditions of safety in organizational contexts. Conclusions: If the focus on school-based strategies to prevent child sexual abuse continues in developing countries, a significant gap in knowledge of the efficacy of population-level interventions outside of school contexts, and consistency across the application of interventions will remain. Evaluations are needed that address the efficacy of broader government-led or whole-of-community prevention interventions to reduce actual prevalence of child sexual abuse, or that can link increased knowledge and skill with reduced victimization."
"Quantifying marine plastic debris in a beach environment using spectral analysis Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Marine plastic debris (MPD) is a globally relevant environmental challenge, with an estimated 8 million tons of synthetic debris entering the marine environment each year. Plastic has been found in all parts of the marine environment, including the surface layers of the ocean, within the water column, in coastal waters, on the benthic layer and on beaches. While research on detecting MPD using remote sensing is increasing, most of it focuses on detecting floating debris in open waters, rather than detecting MPD on beaches. However, beaches present challenges that are unique from other parts of the marine environment. In order to better understand the spectral properties of beached MPD, we present the SWIR reflectance of weathered MPD and virgin plastics over a sandy substrate. We conducted spectral feature analysis on the different plastic groups to better understand the impact that polymers have on our ability to detect synthetic debris at sub-pixel surface covers that occur on beaches. Our results show that the minimum surface cover required to detect MPD on a sandy surface varies between 2â€“8% for different polymer types. Furthermore, plastic composition affects the magnitude of spectral absorption. This suggests that variation in both surface cover and polymer type will inform the efficacy of beach litter detection methods."
"Key preferences of tourists during COVID-19 pandemic in luxury hotels: Evidence from qualitative data Social Media; Online Reviews; Brand Community There is a decline in revenue and occupancy rates in the hotels during the pandemic. For the sustainable and long-term recovery of the hotel industry, the guests need to be analyzed for their stay preferences. This study attempts to find the preferred attributes of the travelers visiting the Indian luxury hotels during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research investigated the post-visit experiences from the online reviews published by tourists on TripAdvisor.com. Thematic salience valence analysis and lexical salience valence analysis was used to identify the vital attributes of the hotel industry. The study revealed staff, location, food, hygiene, and rooms as the preferred hotel attributes, in which the coastal locations were highly considered for location based marketing of luxury hotels, and non-compliance of COVID-19 standards and complaints for upgradations in the rooms were the non-recommenders for the luxury hotels. The dashboard-based salience valence zone analysis was used to provide suggestions to the hotel authorities by revealing the significant and critical hotel attributes simultaneously for prompt handling of the issues during the COVID-19 pandemic."
"A systematic review of e-tail product returns and an agenda for future research Electronic Commerce; Money-back Guarantees; Retailers Purpose: This study conducts a systematic literature review of e-tail product returns research. E-tail product returns are essentially acquisition of products that have been sold through purely online or brick-and-click channels and then returned by consumer to business. Design/methodology/approach: Using a systematic literature review protocol, we identified 75 peer-reviewed articles on e-tail product returns, conducted bibliometric analysis and content analysis of the articles and summarised our findings. Findings: The findings reveal that the subject of e-tail returns is a new research area; academics have started to investigate several aspects of e-tail returns through different research methodologies and theoretical foundations. Further research is required in leading e-commerce countries and on key areas such as omni-channel returns management, customer satisfaction and service, the impact of resources such as people skills, the benefits of technology and IT systems in managing e-tail returns. Practical implications: The study offers a summative account of current e-tail knowledge areas, which can serve as a reference guide for e-tailers to develop strategies for more efficient and competitive product returns. Originality/value: This study contributes theoretically by developing clusters of key themes or knowledge areas about e-tail returns. It also provides a conceptual framework for e-tail returns management, which can be used as a springboard for further empirical research."
"Integrated Full-Spectrum Solar Energy Catalysis for Zero-Emission Ethylene Production from Bioethanol Bioethanol; Dehydration; Propylene Ethylene, a hydrocarbon (C2H4), is one of the widely used products in the chemical industry. A traditional dehydration method of ethanol to ethylene relies strongly on high-temperature and high-pressure process with significant energy consumption. In this regard, producing ethylene from bioethanol through dehydration is a promising and sustainable approach, but, this process under mild conditions results in low yields and poor selectivity. Herein, an integrated solar energy catalytic system driven by only sun energy under ambient conditions is established for the first time for bioethanol dehydration using oxygen-vacancy-abundant (Ov) WO3 coupled with a thin layer of carbon coating (CL) (WO3âˆ’x@C). A record-high ethylene selectivity of 98.1% is achieved driven by full solar spectrum without any external power, featuring zero pollution emission nature. In this process, Ov acts as a solid acid center, which is the key to initiate the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene via a solar thermal process, while the CL promotes solar thermal synergy, ensuring the high reaction temperature and hot carriers transmission simultaneously. In-situ infrared spectroscopy and thermodynamic calculations demonstrate a novel proton hydrogen-mediated catalytic process over WO3âˆ’x@C. This work provides a new opportunity of using full-spectrum solar energy for catalytic generation of value-added chemicals."
"Overcoming the social stigma of consuming food waste by dining at the Open Table Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems Stigma is often encountered by recipients who receive food donations from charities, while the consumption of wasted food, also traditionally considered to be a stigmatized practice, has recently become part of a popular food rescue movement that seeks to reduce environmental impacts. These two stigmasâ€”charitable donation and the consumption of wasteâ€”are brought together at the Open Table, a community group in Melbourne, Australia, that serves community meals cooked from surplus food. This paper examines how Open Table de-stigmatizes food donations through food waste discourse to enable greater social inclusion. I draw on the experiences of donors, cooks, volunteers and eaters gathered from diverse Open Table sites. Taking a â€˜follow-the-thingâ€™ approach, I analyze how food â€˜wasteâ€™ becomes re-valued by embracing goals of environmental justice enacted through local processes of care and conviviality. Relying on networks of volunteers and not-for-profit agencies, Open Table provides a simple, effective and adaptable model for possible replication for overcoming drawbacks of traditional charity practices. Critically though, as hunger in society continues to grow, this approach is increasingly threatened by the need to â€˜single outâ€™ disadvantaged recipients to justify continued supply. This paper contributes to food poverty, waste, and Alternative Food Network literature in two important ways: first, by analyzing the outcomes of community food redistribution approaches with regards to stigma and inclusion; and secondly, by arguing that such holistic approaches need to be acknowledged, valued and supported to shift current discourses and practice."
"A feasibility study and assessment: Distributed solar system in high-density areas Solar Collectors; Solar; Tilt Solar photovoltaic (PV) energy has emerged as an innovation for greenhouse gas reduction in the building and construction industry due to the calculable advantages it possesses. Although there is evidence supporting the inclusion of small-scale roof-mounted PV systems in detached houses, limited studies have been conducted on the implementation of PV in the commercial sector especially within high-density urban areas. This study conducted a detailed value assessment to optimize the cost of applying PV systems in a high-density city area of Melbourne. The Net Present Value results evidence the feasibility to apply roof-mounted polycrystalline PV products in the case study buildings. This research supports investorsâ€™ decisions by understanding the financial values of prefabricated PV systems in high-density regions and provides suggestions to building professionals on value-for-money design."
"“Indiscipline” in context: a political-economic grounding for dangerous driving behaviors among Tro-Tro drivers in Ghana Traffic Behavior; Aggressive Driving; Anger This paper attempts a better explanation for the causes of dangerous driving behaviors among â€œTro-Troâ€(minibus) drivers in Ghana. The current media, policy, and academic coverage of the problem reveals an immutable discourse that considers the behaviors (such as over speeding) as a function of moral failure, indiscipline, or bad attitudes on the part of the drivers. Often little consideration is given to the context of the behaviors and their influences. This paper provides an alternative explanation that considers the behaviors as predictable actions that are systematically connected to the Tro-Tro industry. Tro-Tro drivers operate within a precarious work climate marked by problems such as low wages; cut-throat competition; high level of job insecurity; imposition of non-negotiable throat-cutting daily fees by car owners and harassments from bribe-demanding corrupt police officers. The exigencies of meeting these numerous financial and other demands of their work, not moral failure, are what fuel dangerous driving behaviors among the drivers. Based on this analysis, the present public policy of using penal populism (i.e., heavy fines and prison sentences) to address road trauma in Ghana is ineffective for inducing safer driving behaviors among Tro-Tro drivers. Interventions to reduce road transport problems involving such commercial passenger vehicles in Ghana and other developing countries similarly situated must be broad, more-wider reaching and include initiatives that also address the range of political-economic causes, motivations, and constraints that incentivize the drivers to drive dangerously. The paper contributes to the sustainable development goals of ensuring safe and sustainable transport (SDG 11.2), and reducing deaths and injuries from road accidents (SDG 3.6)."
"Impact of alginate selection for wastewater treatment by immobilised Chlorella vulgaris Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Rapid nutrient removal from municipal wastewater can be achieved by algae immobilised in beads of alginate. The use of immobilised algae has been limited by the additional costs of immobilisation, hence the selection of an alginate with appropriate properties can improve its viability. Nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) removal, biomass productivity, bead stability, and production cost were criteria used to compare the immobilisation of Chlorella vulgaris in three alginate products: food grade, and two laboratory products with low and medium viscosity. Algal biomass productivity was greater for low viscosity (47 mg/L/d) than both medium viscosity (37 mg/L/d) and food grade (36 mg/L/d) alginate while nutrient removal was independent of alginate product in batch culture. As such, the criteria for alginate selection could be narrowed to bead stability and alginate price. Beads prepared from medium viscosity alginate were the least stable as they lost the most strength over four weeks exposure to wastewater, swelled and released more organic carbon than the other two products. This was attributed to the lower proportion of L-guluronate in the polymer for medium viscosity alginate which led to the Ca-alginate having less cross-linking. Greater cross-linking in the structures of the food and low viscosity Ca-alginates was associated with higher porosity (96.7â€“96.8%) and higher immobilisation efficiency (95â€“97%). As immobilisation in food grade alginate led to similar nutrient removal and little loss of stability in wastewater, despite lower algal growth, its lower cost means it presented as an effective alternative to the laboratory products."
"Optimizing the energy consumption in a residential building at different climate zones: Towards sustainable decision making Walls (Structural Partitions); Hot Temperature; Insulation Electricity dependent heating-cooling (H/C) system has increased rapidly to provide thermal comfort to the occupants. H/C is a major source of energy consumption in residential buildings around the world. Studies revealed that the thermal properties of building materials are converted into the same unit as thermal resistance (R) in the USA, Canada, The UK, Australia, and other countries. However, none of the previous studies have considered the adaptation of national insulation codes to reduce electricity cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the correlations of energy consumption (Q) to thermal resistances (R) of the building envelop (A). Therefore, this study attempts to review the optimum energy consumption of a selected house due to H/C at different choices of national code standardized R values. Accurate envelop areas (A) of the selected house components are estimated by applying the Autodesk Revit Building Information Model (BIM) to use in the energy model. The case study critically evaluates the variation of electricity cost, GHG emissions, and selection of the optimized thermostat settings for energy savings in different climatic regions and seasons of a year. Different correlations are obtained using risk analysis software on energy consumptions with code recognized arrays of insulations. This sensitivity analysis result shows that the corelation coefficient of energy consumption with medium-low insulated building envelop (r = 0.44) is more significant than improved, maximum, medium-high, and minimum insulations (r = 0.14â€“0.29) which indicates the insulation range where more emphasis should be put to get an optimized solution. Thus the developed analytical framework supports inclusive decision-making by selecting appropriate kinds of insulation for the design of a sustainable house."
"Productivity in construction industry Labour Productivity; Construction Industry; Crews Since the late 1990s, the construction industry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has lagged behind the rest of the world in actual levels of productivity and productivity growth. This is despite the KSA Governmentâ€™s tremendous support for the construction industry and the expectation that, in the coming decades, the KSA construction industry will continue to develop and grow to achieve the targets of Saudi Vision 2030. This paper explores in depth the concept of productivity to gain insights through answering two questions contextualized within the KSA construction industry: 1) How do managers perceive productivity? and 2) How is productivity measured? Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 senior managers with 10â€“27 yearsâ€™ experience in project management in the KSA construction industry. Qualitative analysis of interview results found that around 40% of interviewees had little or an incorrect understanding of the concept of productivity and its relevance to production processes. This poor understanding of productivity and its measures extends to the lack of clear specific procedures for regular measurement of productivity."
"Acute effects of dietary plant nutrients on transcriptome profiles: evidence from human studies Biomarkers; Hippuric Acid; Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy The health benefits of long-term dietary plant ingestion are well-established. However, literature on acute nutritional challenges is very limited. This study aimed to identify available evidence on transcriptomics responses to acute ingestion of plants or plant extracts and identify signature gene profiles that may serve as biomarkers of health status. We systematically searched electronic databases and extracted information based-on inclusion criteria such as human clinical studies, single plant-based nutrients and outcomes reported on acute transcriptome responses. A total of 11 studies reported on acute intake of plant dietary interventions. Four studies investigating natural oil extracts with three reporting on whole plants and two studies on natural plant-derived extracts. Gene expression was found to be associated with immune response (7 studies), inflammation (9 studies), metabolism (8 studies), cellular processes and cancer. The finding of this systematic review suggests that acute ingestion may significantly impact diverse physiological and pathological pathways including inflammatory, immune, cancer and oxidative stress pathways. Transcriptomics approach is proven to be an effective strategy in discovery of these anticipated mechanisms. Further studies are now required to validate and continue exploring the short-term health impact of dietary plants and their bioactive phytochemicals on gene expression and function."
"The social life of HIV care: On the making of ‘care beyond the virus’ AIDS/HIV; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Antiretroviral Therapy Treating care as an effect of material implementations, we use qualitative interviews with people living with HIV in London, most of whom are migrants, to explore care practices linked to clinical treatment delivered as part of the â€˜cascade of HIV careâ€™. We consider how HIV care is done, and what HIV care does, drawing on assemblage theory. We ask how is care affected by the situations in which it is enacted? and what contingent forms of care does the HIV care cascade potentiate? A prime actor in the care assemblages revealed in our study is immigration, from which multiple uncertainties flow, including access to vital resources such as housing and income. Yet we also found that clinical HIV care is worked-with in practice to afford multiple forms of care. Here, viral care is translated into matters of vital concern to produce care which extends â€˜beyond the virusâ€™. Practices of care beyond the virus afford social protection, including through making-up social relations and networks, and novel modes of sociality. Friendship connections, community organisations and HIV clinics are among the key actors involved. Being attuned to how HIV care is made to matter helps generate new ways of knowing and doing care."
"Mechanism of Bloom syndrome complex assembly required for double Holliday junction dissolution and genome stability DNA; RecQ Helicases; Bloom Syndrome Protein The RecQ-like helicase BLM cooperates with topoisomerase IIIÎ±, RMI1, and RMI2 in a heterotetrameric complex (the â€œBloom syndrome complexâ€) for dissolution of double Holliday junctions, key intermediates in homologous recombination. Mutations in any component of the Bloom syndrome complex can cause genome instability and a highly cancer-prone disorder called Bloom syndrome. Some heterozygous carriers are also predisposed to breast cancer. To understand how the activities of BLM helicase and topoisomerase IIIÎ± are coupled, we purified the active four-subunit complex. Chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry revealed a unique architecture that links the helicase and topoisomerase domains. Using biochemical experiments, we demonstrated dimerization mediated by the N terminus of BLM with a 2:2:2:2 stoichiometry within the Bloom syndrome complex. We identified mutations that independently abrogate dimerization or association of BLM with RMI1, and we show that both are dysfunctional for dissolution using in vitro assays and cause genome instability and synthetic lethal interactions with GEN1/MUS81 in cells. Truncated BLM can also inhibit the activity of full-length BLM in mixed dimers, suggesting a putative mechanism of dominant-negative action in carriers of BLM truncation alleles. Our results identify critical molecular determinants of Bloom syndrome complex assembly required for double Holliday junction dissolution and maintenance of genome stability."
"Mussel-inspired fabrication of superhydrophobic cotton fabric for oil/water separation and visible light photocatalytic Water; Hydrophobicity; Aerogels Flexible multiple functional textiles for oil/water separation and photodegradation are highly demanded in highly effective and environmentally friendly wastewater purification. In this work, Î²-FeOOH nanorods were in situ hydrothermally grown on polydopamine (PDA)-templated cotton fabric (CF) followed by decoration of 1-Dodecanethiol (DDT) on the surface for highly efficient oil/water separation and visible-light-driven photodegradation of dyes. The morphology, structure and wettability of the as-prepared fabrics were characterized and the oil/water separation together with photocatalysis of MB were investigated. The results showed that Î²-FeOOH nanorods were successfully grown on the PDA-templated cotton fabrics with durable hydrophobicity and lipophilicity. The as-prepared fabrics were demonstrated in oil/water separation of different oil with high separation rates, and the mechanism was proposed. The fabrics also showed excellent visible-light-driven photocatalytic performance in degrading methylene blue (MB) solution with stability and reliability, and the photocatalysis mechanism was contributed. This work provides insights on developing multiple functional textiles by combining photocatalysis with special wettability."
"Urban Food Infrastructures: The Role of Inner-City Universities Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems Urban food infrastructures are oft-forgotten as crucial for sustainability transitions. This ethnographic case study explores the eating spaces of an inner-city university to assess its sustainability outcomes. By considering knowledge as embedded in and through social practices as â€œgeneral understandingsâ€, the paper argues that the neo-liberal organisation of eating spaces understands campus spaces as assets, conceives students as individualistic consumers, and outsources sustainability initiatives. The paper contends that these understandings have established a dominant pathway for retail prioritised, gentrified and uni-functional eating spaces, marginalising some existing hybrid and convivial food infrastructures that may be pathways for sustainable and just outcomes. æ‘˜è¦: åŸŽå¸‚é£Ÿå“åŸºç¡€è®¾æ–½ï¼Œå¦‚åŸŽå¸‚å†…çš„å¤§å­¦é¥®é£Ÿç©ºé—´ï¼Œå¾€å¾€è¢«è®¤ä¸ºæ˜¯å‘å¯æŒç»­ç¤¾ä¼šè¿‡æ¸¡çš„å…³é”®ã€‚è¿™ä¸ªå¯¹å¢¨å°”æœ¬å¸‚å†…ä¸€æ‰€å¤§å­¦çš„äººç§å­¦æ¡ˆä¾‹ç ”ç©¶ï¼ŒæŽ¢è®¨äº†å¤§å­¦çš„é¥®é£Ÿç©ºé—´å’Œç©ºé—´ç®¡ç†ï¼Œä»¥è¯„ä¼°å¯æŒç»­æ€§çš„ç»“æžœã€‚é€šè¿‡å°†çŸ¥è¯†åµŒå…¥å¹¶é€šè¿‡ç¤¾ä¼šå®žè·µä½œä¸º â€œä¸€èˆ¬ç†è§£â€ï¼Œæœ¬æ–‡è®¤ä¸ºï¼Œå¤§å­¦é¥®é£Ÿç©ºé—´çš„æ–°è‡ªç”±ä¸»ä¹‰ç»„ç»‡å°†æ˜‚è´µçš„æ ¡å›­ç©ºé—´ç†è§£ä¸ºä¸€ç§èµ„äº§ï¼Œå°†å­¦ç”Ÿè§†ä¸ºä¸ªäººä¸»ä¹‰çš„æ¶ˆè´¹è€…ï¼Œå¹¶å°†å¯æŒç»­æ€§å€¡è®®å¤–åŒ…ã€‚è¿™äº›ç†è§£ä¸ºé›¶å”®ä¸šçš„ä¼˜å…ˆåŒ–ã€ç»…å£«åŒ–å’Œå•ä¸€åŠŸèƒ½çš„é¥®é£Ÿç©ºé—´å»ºç«‹äº†ä¸€æ¡ä¸»è¦çš„é€”å¾„ã€‚å¦å¤–ï¼Œæœ¬æ–‡æå‡ºï¼Œä¸€äº›è¢«è¾¹ç¼˜åŒ–çš„æ··åˆåž‹å’Œä¼‘é—²åž‹é£Ÿå“åŸºç¡€è®¾æ–½å¯èƒ½ä¸ºå¯æŒç»­çš„å’Œå…¬æ­£çš„ç»“æžœæä¾›æ›¿ä»£é€”å¾„ã€‚."
"Construction cost and carbon emission assessment of a highway construction—a case towards sustainable transportation Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Due to its dynamic nature in construction, benchmarking environmental emissions of road construction projects can be a daunting task. Often stakeholders will have to prioritize the economic and environmental indicators based on the project objectives. The study presents a methodological framework to compare economic and environmental impacts to benchmark sustainable transport construction projects. Through findings, the study aims to inform focus areas and key stages of infrastructure projects to benchmark sustainable performance. Process-based emission and cost estimation models are presented with an AHP based weighting factor that enables prioritization of emissions and costs based on project scopes and objectives. Using a case study, results are represented to validate the framework and methodology. Concrete and steel are identified as the main materials that contribute to total carbon emissions, while soil and gravel are responsible for the highest costs. Electricity consumption is discovered as the major fuel type contributing to carbon emissions. Concrete and dump trucks are discovered as the top two sources of emissions and costs, respectively. Scenario analyses revealed that the choice of equipment significantly affects the projectâ€™s emissions and costs. The application of sustainable materials can significantly reduce emissions and cost. The use of the case study approach results in a lack of generalizability. However, the same methodology and process can be adopted for the sustainable benchmarking of different projects. Researchers are encouraged to investigate processes to automate sustainable benchmarking of transport infrastructure construction projects. The study is one of the first attempts to compare cost and environmental impacts using a systematic methodology of transportation infrastructure construction projects."
"Development of SiO2-coumarin fluorescent nanohybrid and its application for Cu(II) sensing in aqueous extracts of roadside soil Fluorescence; Rhodamines; Cupric Ion A SiO2-coumarin nanohybrid was investigated for its Cu(II) sensing performance in aqueous media, and in comparison with the Cu(II)-selective coumarin used alone. Fluorescence of both coumarin itself and the nanohybrid, Î»ex/Î»em 435/481 nm, was selectively quenched by Cu(II) when tested against a range of multivalent cations. The nanohybrid had enhanced Cu(II) sensing properties when compared to the coumarin including (i) improved limit of detection from Î¼M-level (0.48 Î¼M) of Cu(II) using coumarin alone to nM-level (0.033 Î¼M) and (ii) an extended linear detection range of 0.033â€“260 Î¼M (0.0005â€“4.1 mg/mL) Cu(II) compared to 0.48â€“55 Î¼M for the coumarin itself. The lower limit of detection and extended range were achieved with a smaller amount of coumarin and no traces of organic solvents used to help coumarin dissolution. Characterization suggested that under applied test conditions at pH = 5, SiO2 nanoparticles with negative surface charges adsorbed coumarin and then (when present) Cu(II) ions. The SiO2-coumarin nanohybrid was then applied for the determination of Cu(II) levels in aqueous soil extracts reaching over 94% recovery rates when used against the standard soil analysis method by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

"Special WSMC edition paper: What is this thing called money? Economic abuse in young adult relationships Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Economics of Scale Purpose: This paper aims to investigate how economic abuse manifests in young adult relationships from the perspective of practice experts to inform the role of social marketing in economic abuse prevention. Practitioners were asked for their views on prevention strategies at the individual, relationship, community and societal levels. Design methodology/approach: Twenty-four experts were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Findings: Experts reported that young adults experienced economic exploitation, adverse economic entanglement and economic control. Young adultsâ€™ frame of reference was a challenge for practitioners. Experts believed that more work needed to be done to improve the financial literacy of young adults. Research limitations/implications: Practitioner views provide one side of the story. A separate study has been established interviewing young adults to explore these issues further. Practical implications: The authors argue that prevention and intervention strategies need to focus on young adults who are in their critical relationship formation stage. The identified attitudinal factors present a challenge to policy, prevention and service providers. Originality/value: The authors shift the attention from service engaged women leaving violent relationships to young adults who have not sought assistance from community or domestic violence services. In doing so, they highlight the importance of the relationship formation phase. This paper raises the challenge for social marketers to consider appropriate prevention and intervention programmes for this cohort. Current and future campaigns and programmes need to be designed and evaluated with an economic abuse lens."
"Child protection and family group conferencing curriculum for social workers in Palestine First International; Indigenization; Family Preservation This article describes a United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund project to develop a child protection curriculum in social work schools in Palestine conducted over 2016, 2017 and 2018. The curriculum was delivered in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as to a delegation from Palestine in Melbourne. The article discusses the challenges and highlights in introducing a rights and strength-based, child-focused, family-inclusive, and trauma-informed child protection curriculum in the context of occupation, poverty and patriarchy. It emphasises the need for critical reflection for foreign educators in relation to culture, gender, human rights and anti-oppressive practices when teaching in the Middle East and other collective cultures. The key outcomes were new collaborations between Palestinian academics from Gaza and the West Bank, as well as their preference for family group conferencing over traditional Western case management models of child protection to promote peaceful, inclusive societies."
"Decision model to integrate community preferences and nudges into the selection of alternatives in infrastructure development Tendering; Project Delivery; Lean Production Selection of alternatives for sustainable infrastructure development is governed by many quantitative and qualitative factors that may be conflicting such as life cycle cost, environmental concerns, expansion feasibility, projected community growth, perception of the communities, lobbying efforts, and regulatory requirements. A framework to integrate these intrinsic factors is the basis of an optimal, sustainable, transparent, and practical decision. In this paper we present a decision model to reflect social and political dynamics in a multi-criteria decision making framework at the early stages of sustainable infrastructure development. The concepts of choosing by advantages (CBA), equilibria of social power between actors, and life cycle cost analysis are used to assess the decision in environmental/technical, social/political, and economic dimensions. Application of the model is discussed for the case of selecting urban/rural wastewater system alternatives. Theoretically, the proposed multi-dimensional decision model aims to integrate the political and social dynamics of the actors including their incentives into the structured decision space of sustainable infrastructure. The proposed model also further extends the existing literature through transparent account of trade-offs across technical, economic, and political dimensions of the selection of alternatives. Policy makers can specifically apply it in the feasibility stage of infrastructure development to facilitate integration of sustainability goals within a network of involved actors, observe the potential trade-offs between sustainability metrics, increase practicality and transparency of the public policy making, and explore the potential impact of nudges to instigate sustainability within infrastructure development."
"COVID-19 AND CREMATION OF HUMAN CORPSE DURING DISASTER: NATIONAL SECURITY VS RELIGION BELIEF Disaster Management; Malaysia; Floods Coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a pandemic worldwide. The number of deaths is increasing without a vaccine to stop its spread and has threatened Malaysiaâ€™s national security. With the increased number of human fatalities due to COVID-19, cremation may be the final solution to prevent the spread from dead bodies as the virus remains on the body after death. However, religion has different perspectives in dealing with the cremation of the dead body. Malaysia is a Muslim majority country but its citizens also consisted of Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, and others. This study will look at the acceptance of Malaysians on the issue of cremating dead bodies during disasters. A qualitative approach was used with respondents answering questionnaires. Analysis of legislation related to disaster management of human corpses was also conducted. Results show that the majority of the respondents disagreed with the cremation of the dead body because of their religion and they believe that there must be a better alternative to deal with the dead body infected by COVID-19."
"The Southern Bluefin Tuna Mucosal Microbiome Is Influenced by Husbandry Method, Net Pen Location, and Anti-parasite Treatment Mycobiome; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Otus Aquaculture is the fastest growing primary industry worldwide. Marine finfish culture in open ocean net pens, or pontoons, is one of the largest growth areas and is currently the only way to rear high value fish such as bluefin tuna. Ranching involves catching wild juveniles, stocking in floating net pens and fattening for 4 to 8 months. Tuna experience several parasite-induced disease challenges in culture that can be mitigated by application of praziquantel (PZQ) as a therapeutic. In this study, we characterized the microbiome of ranched southern Bluefin Tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, across four anatomic sites (gill, skin, digesta, and anterior kidney) and evaluated environmental and pathological factors that influence microbiome composition, including the impact of PZQ treatment on microbiome stability. Southern bluefin tuna gill, skin, and digesta microbiome communities are unique and potentially influenced by husbandry practices, location of pontoon growout pens, and treatment with the antiparasitic PZQ. There was no significant relationship between the fish mucosal microbiome and incidence or abundance of adult blood fluke in the heart or fluke egg density in the gill. An enhanced understanding of microbiome diversity and function in high-value farmed fish species such as bluefin tuna is needed to optimize fish health and improve aquaculture yield. Comparison of the bluefin tuna microbiome to other fish species, including Seriola lalandi (yellowtail kingfish), a common farmed species from Australia, and Scomber japonicus (Pacific mackerel), a wild caught Scombrid relative of tuna, showed the two Scombrids had more similar microbial communities compared to other families. The finding that mucosal microbial communities are more similar in phylogenetically related fish species exposes an opportunity to develop mackerel as a model for tuna microbiome and parasite research."
"Domestic and International Drivers of the Demand for Water Resources in the Context of Water Scarcity: A Cross-Country Study Water Demand; Family Characteristic; End Use Global warming, while increasing human demand for water, is reducing water availability by reducing runoff flows and the effective amount of water between seasons, making water scarcity a growing problem globally. Water management plays an important role in mitigating global warming, improving the water cycle, reducing carbon emissions, and providing clean energy, and pricing water is considered a good approach to water management. Pricing water needs to take into account all sectors and aspects of society, such as domestic water, food and agriculture, energy, transport, industry, urban provision, human health, ecosystems, and the environment, and their interrelationships through water, within the context of the fundamental human rights to water and sanitation. This requires that every stakeholder should contribute to the development of water-related policies at every stage of the water interrelationship. This study investigated the relationship between water demand across different sectors of the economy using indicators for China, Australia, Japan, and the UK. Using panel analyses, this study finds that economic growth and population expansion increases the demand for water in all aspects. These findings have significant policy implications for water management. Because water prices can have an impact on global trade and, more importantly, are a major solution to global warming, water management policies should be considered at the global level, not only at the national level."
"Study on the critical factors and hot spots of crude oil tanker accidents Collision Avoidance; Waterways; Vessel The safety of crude oil tankers is always a focus under the rapid development of oil trade and maritime transportation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the critical factors that lead to crew casualties and address the hot spot distribution characteristics by reviewing accident data over the last 26 years. A Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) regression model is introduced to evaluate the extent of eight selected factors on crew mortality. Three others regression models (Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Zero-Inflated Poisson regression model) are chosen for model comparison to demonstrate the superiority of the ZINB model. The results showed that the ZINB model outperforms the other regression models in terms of fitting performance. The leading contributors of the crude oil tanker accident casualties were found as foundered and fire/explosion, followed by war loss/hostilities, collision, weather conditions, classification society, hull/machinery damage, and ship size. Furthermore, the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) methodology is adopted to identify hot spots and their trend evolution features of critical accident factors. Crude oil tanker accidents were observed more likely to occur in the waters around the United Kingdom, Gulf of Mexico, Strait of Malacca & Singapore Strait, Mediterranean Sea, China, Japan & Korea, and the Gulf Area, which may be due to the dense shipping routes, poor geographical conditions, and adverse weather conditions. The results of this study provide conducive suggestions for those policy-makers to develop appropriate and effective strategies for preventing crude oil tanker accidents."
"Public Sector Accountability to Implement Sustainable Development Goals in Sri Lanka: Influence of Traditional and Non-Traditional Donors Decision Making; Social Impact Assessment; Environmental Impact Statements Implementation of Sustainable development Goals (SDGs) for better environmental sustainability in developing countries in Asia has taken centre stage in response to the major environmental and social degradation created through rapid economic development in the region. Further, lack of clarity in environmental accountability of traditional economic developmental activities and internationally funded infrastructure development projects has resulted in reduced water and air quality and imperilled biodiversity. SDG related research in developing country context is limited and the impact of the funding bodies on public sector governance and accountability is scarce. This paper aims to fill this gap by addressing environmental accountability of public sector entities in internationally funded development projects in Sri Lanka, as a fast-developing country in Asia. The results indicate that environmental degradation is a continuing issue in Sri Lanka despite the efforts of traditional donor agencies monitoring and implementing environmental sustainability guidelines and SDG principles in infrastructure projects. The drastic change in the donor landscape experienced in the country with the rise of non-traditional donors and the deficiencies in public sector governance and accountability structures pose a significant threat to attainment of SDGs, including environmental sustainability in Sri Lanka."
"Engaging with artificial intelligence (AI) with a bottom-up approach for the purpose of sustainability: Victorian farmers market association, Melbourne Australia Machine Ethics; Artificial Intelligence; Roboethics Artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting all aspects of food systems, including production, food processing, distribution, and consumption. AI, if implemented ethically for sustainability, can enhance biodiversity, conserve water and energy resources, provide land-related services, power smart cities, and help mitigate climate change. However, there are significant issues in using AI to transition to sustainable food systems. AIâ€™s own carbon footprint could cancel out any sustainability benefits that it creates. Additionally, the technology could further entrench inequalities between and within countries, and bias against minorities or less powerful groups. This paper draws on findings from a study of the Victorian Farmersâ€™ Markets Association (VFMA) that investigated the complexity of designing AI tools to enhance sustainability and resilience for the benefit of the organisation and its members. Codesign workshops, both synchronous and asynchronous, semi-structured interviews, and design innovation methods led the VFMA to experiment with an AI tool to link sustainable soil practices, nutrient rich produce, and human health. The analysis shows that the codesign process and an agile approach created a co-learning environment where sustainability and ethical questions could be considered iteratively within transdisciplinary engagement. The bottom-up approach developed through this study supports organisations who want to engage with AI while reinforcing fairness, transparency, and sustainability."
"Infrastructure Financing for Climate Change Adaptation in Australia: Practitioners’ Perspectives Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience With increased climate-related risks and natural disasters, impacts on infrastructure assets are intensifying. As the need for adaptation actions increase, how finance is used to enable adaptation plays a vital role in the resilience of infrastructure. This research aims to understand how infrastructure adaptation measures are carried out, focusing on how financing is used to aid such efforts. Exploratory interviews with infrastructure and finance practitioners from a broad range of organisations were conducted to understand the dynamics of how infrastructure adaptation occurs. The findings reveal that infrastructure agencies conduct adaptation activities to maintain the serviceability of assets under climate change risks, with most climate financing targeting mitigation rather than adaptation. Most actions are taken at individual asset or agency level with little collaboration across agencies and sectors. The results illustrate a need for a more holistic, systems-level approach to adaptation across the infrastructure sector in Australia."
"Experimental fluid dynamics characterization of a novel micropump-mixer Manipulation; Single Molecule; Electrokinetics The application of lab-on-a-chip systems to biomedical engineering and medical biology is rapidly growing. Reciprocating micropumps show significant promise as automated bio-fluid handling systems and as active reagent-to-sample mixers. Here, we describe a thorough fluid dynamic analysis of an active micro-pump-mixer designed for applications of preclinical blood analysis and clinical diagnostics in hematology. Using high-speed flow visualization and micro-particle image velocimetry measurements, a parametric study is performed to investigate the fluid dynamics of six discrete modes of micropump operation. With this approach, we identify an actuation regime that results in optimal sample flow rates while concomitantly maximizing reagent-to-sample mixing."
"Differentiation between Impacted and Unimpacted Microbial Communities of a Nitrogen Contaminated Aquifer Ecosystem; Macroinvertebrates; Gammarus Pulex Nitrogen contamination is ubiquitous across the globe; as a result of this, the need to understand and predict the extent and effects of nitrogen contamination on microbial ecosystems is increasingly important. This paper utilises a dataset that provides a rare opportunity to observe varying contamination conditions in a single aquifer and understand the differences between potential background bores and two different types of contamination spread across the other bores. Using physicochemical and microbiological community analysis, this paper aims to determine the impacts of the two contaminants, nitrate and ammonia, on the microbial communities and the differences between polluted and physicochemical background bores. Total nitrogen (N) varied by a factor of over 2000 between bores, ranging from 0.07 to 155 mg Lâˆ’1. Nitrate (NO3âˆ’) concentrations ranged from 150 to <0.01 mg Lâˆ’1; ammonium (NH4+) concentrations ranged from 26 to <0.1 mg Lâˆ’1. MANOVA analysis confirmed an overall significant relationship (p = 0.0052) between N variables and the physicochemical data (or status) of the three areas of contamination dubbed â€˜contamination zonesâ€™. The contamination zones were defined by no known presence of contamination in the uncontaminated bores, the presence of NO3âˆ’ contamination and the presence of NO3âˆ’ and NH4+ contamination. PERMANOVA analysis confirmed that there was an overall significant difference in the microbial communities between the three contamination zones (p = 0.0002); however, the presence of NH4+ had a significant effect (p = 0.0012). In general, the nitrate-contaminated bores showed a decrease in the abundance of individual OTUs. We further confirmed that NH4+ contamination had a significant relationship with an increased percentage of abundance occupied by the Planctomycetota phylum (specifically the Candidatus Brocadia genus). It was found that one of the two background bores (BS-004) was likely also representative of natural microbial background, and another (BS-002) showed characteristics that may be representative of past or intermittent contamination. This paper demonstrates a possible way to determine the microbial background and discusses the potential uses for this information."
"Entrapping Living Probiotics into Collagen Scaffolds: A New Class of Biomaterials for Antibiotic-Free Therapy of Bacterial Vaginosis Vagina Flora; Gardnerella Vaginalis; Atopobium Vaginae A new concept of biomaterials for antibiotic-free therapy of bacterial vaginosis (BV) is here proposed. These biomaterials are obtained by entrapping two probiotic biofilms, viz., Lactobacillus fermentum (Lf) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (La) into scaffolds of self-assembled collagen fibers (col). An in-depth characterization and viability assays are performed on the resulting biomaterials. Results demonstrated that the collagen matrix plays a multifold role in improving the probiotic efficacy in a BV-simulated environment: i) it acts as a host to the formation of the probiotic biofilm, ii) it protects live probiotics during storage under harsh conditions, iii) it enhances the metabolic activity of entrapped probiotics thereby restoring the pH of BV-simulated microenvironment, and iv) it enhances the adhesion of probiotics to the simulated vaginal mucosa. These collective properties make these biomaterials as promising candidates for treating BV without antibiotics. In addition, the approach here presented can be adapted for the treatment of other complex microbial infections."
"Graphene nanoplatelets-reinforced magnesium metal matrix nanocomposites with superior mechanical and corrosion performance for biomedical applications Powder Metallurgy; Metal Matrix Composites; Graphite Magnesium (Mg) metal matrix composites (MMCs) reinforced with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) have been developed by powder metallurgy (PM). GNPs with different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 wt.%), layer thicknesses (5 nm and 9 nm), and particle sizes (15 Âµm and 5 Âµm) were dispersed into Mg powder by high-energy ball-milling processes. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated composites were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and compression tests. The corrosion resistance was evaluated by electrochemical tests and hydrogen evolution measurements. The cytotoxicity of Mg-GNPs composites was assessed using osteoblast-like SaOS2 cells. The results indicate that GNPs are excellent candidates as reinforcements in Mg matrices for the manufacture of biodegradable Mg-based composite implants. GNP addition improved the mechanical properties of Mg via synergetic strengthening modes. Moreover, retaining the structural integrity of GNPs during processing improved the ductility, compressive strength, and corrosion resistance of the Mg-GNP composites. Cytotoxicity assessments did not reveal any significant toxicity with the addition of GNPs to Mg matrices. This study demonstrates that Mg-xGNPs with x < 0.3 wt.%, may constitute novel biodegradable implant materials for load-bearing applications."
"The environmental effect of trade liberalization: Evidence from China's manufacturing firms Misallocation; China; Firm Heterogeneity While prior literature on trade liberalisation and the environment has mostly focused on the macroeconomic ramifications, this study explores at the firm level whether and how changes of trade barriers brought about by China's accession to the WTO may impact on its manufacturing firmsâ€™ environmental performance. Adopting a difference-in-differences (DID) methodology, we document the effects of tariff reductions on improving firm-level SO2 emission intensity, and the key corporate strategic decisions responsible for delivering the observed results, with robustness tests covering other major pollutants. In response to trade liberalisation, firms are found to increase labour resources for environmental protection and to improve their production processes to reduce emission intensity. This study contributes to the literature by investigating at the level of the operating firm how output and input tariff reductions may impact on environmental performance and uncovering for the first time the specific actions responsible for the results."
"Roasted Wheat Germ: A Natural Plant Product in Development of Nutritious Milk Pudding; Physicochemical and Nutritional Properties Fatty Acid; Rancidity; Tocopherols Wheat germ has been recognized as an economical source of high-quality plant proteins and bioactive compounds for food fortification. Thus, it can be used for valorization of food products as a feasible strategy to enhance the nutritional quality and reduce wheat milling waste. In this research roasted wheat germ (RG) was added in formulation of egg-free milk pudding to enhance its nutritional value and the effects of RG particle size (125, 210 and 354 Âµm) and quantity (0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10%) on the quality, nutritional and sensory properties of the resulting pudding were investigated. Reducing the particle size of RG significantly altered its chemical composition but had no significant effect on its antioxidant activity. Increasing the level of RG in the pudding, reduced pH and syneresis while increased dry matter content, hardness, cohesiveness and gumminess of the product. The quantity of RG had more effects on physicochemical properties of the puddings than changing the particle size. Based on the sensory evaluation results, the most acceptable sample was obtained by addition of 7.5% RG with a particle size of 125 Âµm."
"Direct and indirect carbon emissions in foundation construction – Two case studies of driven precast and cast-in-situ piles Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building Precast technique has gained significant reputation in the construction industry due to improved efficiency and reduced construction waste. Pile foundation is often built through driven precast or cast-in-situ construction technique. The two types of pile foundations have been widely utilised in various building construction types. The selection of the piling methods has been largely based on the project scope, soil conditions and availability of resources. However, little research has been conducted on environmental impacts brought by driven precast piles compared to cast-in-situ bored piles. The paper aims to address the research gap by conducting a comparative study to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of driven precast and cast-in-situ piles construction using two case studies in China. A process-based quantification model is developed to measure the major emissions and impacts due to materials, transportation and equipment usage. Results of the study indicated 113.04 and 107.46 kgCO2 per pile per metre of excavated depth for case study A and B respectively. Results of the study also observed a reduction for equipment usage and an increase for transportation in GHG emissions for driven precast piles as compared to cast-in-situ piles. Four scenarios were selected to further investigate the GHG emissions variation. Results indicated that use of sustainable materials can achieve the maximum GHG emissions reduction for both types of pile construction. Transportation distance was recorded as a key factor to be considered in reducing GHG emissions for driven precast piles construction. Results of the study can be effectively utilised to compare life cycle GHG emissions of precast construction with cast-in-situ construction."
"How social media can fuel innovation in businesses: a strategic roadmap Alliance Portfolios; Firm; Open Innovation Purpose: This paper aims to present a framework to guide managerial action for social media (SM) strategies for innovation by exploring its constituent elements â€“ the â€œwhatâ€ (SM types), the â€œwhoâ€ (stakeholders to be reached), the â€œforâ€ (innovation types) and the â€œhowâ€ (innovation process stages), as well as the value, benefits and barriers. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive and critical review of literature at the intersection of SM and innovation guides the development of a typology of SM types and their use across innovation types and stages. Findings: SM type and use tend to differ across innovation processes. The authors identify four types of SM in use across four stages of innovation, supporting six types of innovation, influenced by five categories of barriers, benefits and stakeholders each. Research limitations/implications: The research provides an integrative set of building blocks to consider for developing further studies of SM and innovation. Practical implications: By highlighting the intertwined aspects of SM and innovation in an open and collaborative environment, the paper calls for development of an SM readiness organisational diagnosis. It empowers managers with a coherent framework of different elements they should take into consideration when defining their SM strategies for innovation. Originality/value: Research on SM adoption and the extent of its usage for innovation purposes is still at its infancy. Given the increasingly open and collaborative innovation settings, the authors draw managerial attention to the need of SM strategies for innovation activities and provide a coherent analytical framework to guide action for organisational diagnosis."
"The Australian energy transition as a federalism challenge: (Un)cooperative energy federalism? Renewable Portfolio Standard; Solar Energy Conversion; Green Certificates The law and regulation of the energy sector in Australia is subject to overlapping responsibilities of both federal and state governments. Crucially for energy transition efforts, neither energy, environment nor climate is mentioned in the Australian Constitution. Australia has a tradition of creative cooperative federalism solutions for responding to problems of national importance. In the energy sector this has resulted in an intricate national framework for energy markets, which relies on mirror legislation passed by participating states, with oversight by state and federal executive governments. Independently of these frameworks, both federal and state governments have passed climate change legislation, which crucially includes renewable energy support mechanisms. At a time when a rapid transition to a decarbonized energy system is essential, legal frameworks struggle to respond in a timely fashion. The political discourse around energy has become increasingly toxic â€“ reflecting a dysfunctional stateâ€“federal relationship in energy and climate law. Australia needs to consider whether its cooperative federalism solutions are sufficient to support the energy transition and how climate law at the state and federal levels interacts with energy market legal frameworks."
"Associations between microplastic pollution and land use in urban wetland sediments Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Microplastic pollution is concerning because it is widespread in aquatic environments and there is growing evidence of negative biological effects. Here, we present one of the first studies to examine microplastic pollution (plastic particles < 1 mm) in urban wetlands and investigate relationships between contamination and urban land use. Sediment samples were collected from 20 independent urban wetlands, each with different types of urban land use within their catchments. Microplastics were observed at all wetlands, with an average abundance of around 46 items/kg of dry sediment. Plastic fragments were the most common type of microplastic, accounting for 68.5% of all microplastics found. Consistent with other studies, microplastic abundance was positively correlated with increased catchment urbanisation. On closer examination, plastic fragments and beads correlated with catchment urbanisation. Fragment abundance also increased in wetlands with catchments that had a higher proportion of industrial land use and decreased in catchments with higher residential densities. This study demonstrates the susceptibility of urban wetlands to microplastic pollution, further highlighting the ubiquitous nature of microplastic pollution. The prevalence of microplastic fragments indicates that plastic litter degradation is a significant source of microplastics in urban environments, especially in industrial areas."
"Bridging tangible and virtual realities: Computational procedures for data-informed participatory processes Education; Tabletop; Multi-Touch Driven by technological advances, growing amounts of available data, and an emergent need for participatory processes, landscape architecture is witnessing a moment of disruption whereby formerly separated areas of operation become increasingly connected. While distinctions between various aspects of the design process are diminishing, a need for a novel, more inclusive toolset arises. The â€˜tangible tableâ€™ paradigm is an attempt at combining intuitive ways of physical modelling with data-driven design strategies and the interactive simulation of naturally occurring phenomena. Despite its existence for more than 20 years, tangible tables have mainly focused on very specific workflows and therefore have not found wider adoption in landscape architectural practice or education. We list the limitations of previous implementations and introduce a novel software solution aimed at popularizing tangible table setups. Our software is embedded in a widespread visual programming environment, which allows for straightforward augmentation of physical models with computational design tech-niques. Using a week-long PhD course as a case study, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed software and its potential applications to solving various landscape architectural challenges through increased emphasis on participatory processes."
"Technology-Facilitated Domestic and Sexual Violence: A Review Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica This article investigates the phenomenon of domestic and sexual violence against adult women using digital communications technologies. The article explores terminological and conceptual challenges and describes the empirical research literature in this field to date in relation to digital dating abuse, intimate partner cyberstalking, technology-facilitated sexual assault, image-based sexual abuse, and online sexual harassment. The article also discusses policy and practice responses to this growing problem, as well as future directions for research. We argue that research and practice need to be guided by existing conceptual frameworks that utilize gender and actorâ€“network theory to understanding the causes and consequences of womenâ€™s experiences of abuse and violence facilitated by digital technologies."
"Sustainable developments and corporate social responsibility in Vietnamese fashion enterprises Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate the status of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility in fashion enterprises in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is qualitative in nature and utilized a multiple case study approach (questionnaires and face-to-face interviews) to achieve the objectives of the research. NVivo was used to analyze the data. Findings: Findings showed that by collaborating with the local artisans to create the unique clothing lines, the fashion brands try to blend and upscale the traditional indigenous clothing styles with modern design concepts to promote the diversity of Vietnamese ethnic culture. The findings also suggest that both the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large enterprises (LEs) should maintain their corporate social responsibility (CSR) concepts to comply with the legal obligations such as salary and welfare benefits for employees, work safety, gender equality and promotions. Further, the CSR activities should address the social issues with their target stakeholders, particularly with the local communities. Originality/value: This study sought to provide a snapshot on the current sustainable practices followed in Vietnamese fashion enterprises."
"Wearing, speaking and shouting about sexism: developing arts-based interventions into sexism in the academy Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work This paper examines a project that developed humorous, irreverent and subversive arts-based interventions into sexism in the academy. Two workshops were run with women currently working in teacher education in Australian universities. The researchers worked with the participants collaboratively and in line with feminist practices and methodologies to develop interventions that were performed at a large multidisciplinary educational research conference. The paper outlines the origins of the project, the feminist scholarship that inspired it, the methodological framework as well as a discussion about three of the interventions and demonstrates that sexism both (re)produces structural disadvantage for women in higher education as well as being characterised by a set of micro practices that shape the everyday experiences of women in the academy. Although this research is set within an Australian context, the paper acknowledges that sexism is systemic within higher education across contexts."
"Many IUCN red list species have names that evoke negative emotions Sentiment Classification; Data Mining; Product Review Species common names underpin communication between researchers, stakeholders and the public. Changing unappealing (e.g., rough-skinned horned toad), misleading (e.g., lesser bird of paradise) or even immemorable (e.g., little grassbird) species names could be an effective, and inexpensive, way to improve engagement with and support for threatened species. We use two sentiment lexicons to analyze the common names of 26,794 IUCN Red List animal species to understand which words drive sentiment in species names. Words driving common name sentiment varied across taxonomic class and threat status; highly frequent words associated with human emotions included anger, fear, disgust, and joy. We identified keywords for future targeted research on strategic name changes (e.g., greater, golden, least, lesser, false). This article provides essential grounding for future species common name research and improving public engagement with threatened species."
"Drivers and challenges for knowledge sharing in an emerging and government driven industry cluster in Saudi Arabia Regional Innovation Systems; Firm; Innovation Networks Underpinned by the Saudi Arabian government's initiative to reduce the country's dependency on oil, this paper examines the drivers and challenges to knowledge sharing in an emerging and government driven industry cluster. National and regional level innovation policies identify clustering as a key enabler of competitive and economic achievement. What is not clear are the mechanisms through which actor proximity enhances value to individual cluster members. While knowledge creation has been associated with cluster effectiveness and individual actor capacity to innovate, there is still a lack of clarity on cluster influence on enabling knowledge sharing during the early development stage of a cluster. In addition, contextual cluster investigations within the Middle East, the GCC and Saudi Arabia in particular, are limited. This article contributes towards closing this gap by analysing knowledge sharing in an emerging government driven cluster in a developing economy, Saudi Arabia."
"Performance Enhancement of an Economically Operated DC Microgrid With a Neural Network–Based Tri-Port Converter for Rural Electrification Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems The DC Microgrid sounds familiar in recent days for its independent grid operation and energizing small communities without relying on the central grid. The sudden change in energy demand in the microgrid can negatively impact its performance and operation. Energy management is the only optimal solution to the energy production of microgrids. This article -discusses an economically operated DC microgrid for rural electrification with a tri-port converter based on the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based intelligent control strategy to provide enhanced performance to the microgrid. The advantage of the proposed system is that it provides optimal energy management solutions during dynamic loading conditions and enhances the operation of the microgrid. The outstanding aspect of the proposed system is that it boosts the conversion operation and effectively manages the battery energy storage system to supply energy to the domestic loads and supply power to the grid during excess power generation. In the assessment, the rural regions of Tamilnadu and Andhra Pradesh, India, have been considered to enhance the microgrid setup. The performance evaluation of the proposed system has been conducted and validated using an experimental setup. The assessment also discusses the economic and environmental analysis in using the proposed system. The results support the performance and efficiency of the proposed model."
"Tumor in 3d: In vitro complex cellular models to improve nano-drugs cancer therapy Tumor Spheroid; Organoids; Tumor Microenvironment Nanodrugs represent novel solutions to reshuffle repurposed drugs for cancer ther-apy. They might offer different therapeutic options by combining targeted drug delivery and imaging in unique platforms. Such nanomaterials are deemed to overcome the limitations of currently available treatments, ultimately improving patientsâ€™ life quality. However, despite these promises being made for over three decades, the poor clinical translation of nanoparti-cle-based therapies calls for deeper in vitro and in vivo investigations. Translational issues arise very early during the development of nanodrugs, where complex and more reliable cell models are often replaced by easily accessible and convenient 2D monocultures. This is par-ticularly true in the field of cancer therapy. In fact, 2D monocultures provide poor information about the real impact of the nanodrugs in a complex living organism, especially given the poor mimicry of the solid Tumors Microenvironment (TME). The dense and complex ex-tracellular matrix (ECM) of solid tumors dramatically restricts nanoparticles efficacy, impair-ing the successful implementation of nanodrugs in medical applications. Herein, we propose a comprehensive guideline of the 3D cell culture models currently available, including their potential and limitations for the evaluation of nanodrugs activity. Advanced culture techniques, more closely resembling the physiological conditions of the TME, might give a better predic-tion of the reciprocal interactions between cells and nanoparticles and eventually help recon-sider the use of old drugs for new applications."
"Internalizing animals and ecosystems in social citizenship and social policy: From political community to political country Environmental Justice; Injustice; Air Quality The aim of this editorial is to explore, conceptualize, and research the need to internalize both animals and ecosystems in our understanding of social citizenship and social policy. This editorial should be seen as a brief overview of the themes that should be covered in the contributions to the Special Issue, â€œInternalizing Animals and Ecosystems in Social Citizenship and Social Policy: From Political Community to Political Countryâ€. This Special Issue argues the importance of integrating animals and ecosystems as a way to reâ€politicize humansâ€™ social relation with both animals and our ecosystem as in sustainable development and social policy. If environmental policy becomes social policy, we would reâ€construct social citizenship to include consideration for animals and ecosystems as integral part of social policy. This expansion in scope is a progression from seeing humans as part of a political community to becoming more involved in their political country. This aligns with the concept of Countryâ€”an allâ€encompassing term in Australia, involving a peopleâ€™s territory, land, water, biological resources, the complex obligations and relationships involved."
"Development of sustainable mortar using waste rice husk ash from rice mill plant: Physical and thermal properties Cement; Rice Hulls; Mortar The rice processing industry generates a significant amount of rice husk ash (RHA) waste, which is considered as cost-efficient and environmentally friendly pozzolanic material. This study used RHA as a replacement for filler material/fine aggregate in the mortar. The mechanical, thermal, and environmental performance of mortar comprising RHA waste as a replacement of river sand in different contents (0, 10, 20, 30 and 50% by weight of river sand) were investigated through experimental tests and environmental impact assessment. The RHAs were obtained from both controlled burnt (CBRHA) and opened burnt (OBRHA) processes and used to produce the mortar mixtures. Results show that OBRHA can be used as a partial replacement for river sand for up to 30% of weight to improve the thermal performance by reducing thermal conductivity up to 62% while keeping the adequate compressive strength. Further, the replacement of 30% weight of sand with OBRHA in conventional mortar production significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. 13% reduction per kg) and cost (4% reduction per kg)."
"The “Boys’ Club”, sexual harassment, and discriminatory resourcing: An exploration of the barriers faced by women sport officials in Australian basketball Basketball; Referees; Football Sport official's experience of abuse in their role is well documented, but the additional gendered barriers that women officials face are not. This study used Concept Mapping to explore the most important and frequent barriers that women referees and officials in Australian basketball face. Results were analyzed according to the Socio-Ecological Framework with a feminist lens, which demonstrated the complexity and interconnectedness of barriers between different levels. While participants were not specifically asked about gendered experiences, the results indicated that barriers were overwhelmingly gendered at every level, including discriminatory resourcing, lack of senior women, and concerningly, incidents of sexual harassment. This research sheds new light on the experience of women officials and the organizational and societal barriers that limit their careers and make their workplace unsafe. Finally, it discusses where the locus of responsibility lies in addressing these issues for women sport officials, placing emphasis on the role of organizations."
"Daytime thermal performance of different urban surfaces: a case study in educational institution precinct of Melbourne Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Microclimate This paper aims to understand thermal behaviour of common urban surface materials in Melbourneâ€™s city centre. A set of field experiments were conducted in three open spaces of an educational precinct in Melbourne, Australia. These experiments were performed during three seasons from November 2014 to May 2015. This study monitored and compared daily and seasonal variation of Ta near surfaces (Tns) of eight common materials including asphalt (regular (AA) and painted (PA)), timber (T), Astroturf (AT), garden bed (GB), exposed concrete aggregate (EAC) and granite cobblestone paver (GCP). It also explored the impact of different factors on values of Tns including urban meteorological parameters, design features and the level of light conditions. The results proved the role of cool materials in the mitigation of urban heat island effects. The findings are also promising for enhancing the thermal comfort of urban residents visiting outdoor spaces, particularly during the hot spells."
"Autoantibodies against HSF1 and CCDC155 as biomarkers of early-Stage, high-Grade serous ovarian cancer Autoantibodies; Antigens; Biomarkers Background: Tumor-directed circulating autoantibodies (AAb) are a well-established feature of many solid tumor types, and are often observed prior to clinical disease manifestation. As such, they May provide a good indicator of early disease development. We have conducted a pilot study to identify novel AAbs as markers of early-stage high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs). Methods: A rare cohort of patients with early (FIGO stage Ia-c) HGSOCs for IgG, IgA, and IgM-mediated AAb reactivity using high-content protein arrays (containing 9,184 individual proteins). AAb reactivity against selected antigens was validated by ELISA in a second, independent cohort of individual patients. Results: A total of 184 antigens were differentially detected in early-stage HGSOC patients compared with all other patient groups assessed. Among the six most highly detected ""early-stage"" antigens, anti-IgA AAbs against HSF1 and anti-IgG AAbs CCDC155 (KASH5; nesprin 5) were significantly elevated in patients with early-stage malignancy. Receiver operating characteristic analysis suggested that AAbs against HSF1 provided better detection of early-stage malignancy than CA125 alone. Combined measurement of anti- HSF1, anti- CCDC155, and CA125 also improved efficacy at higher sensitivity. Conclusions: The combined measurement of anti- HSF1, anti- CCDC155, and CA125 May be useful for early-stage HGSOC detection. Impact: This is the first study to specifically identify AAbs associated with early-stage HGSOC. The presence and high frequency of specific AAbs in early-stage cancer patients warrants a larger scale examination to define their value for early disease detection at primary diagnosis and/or recurrence.

"Drying shrinkage properties of expanded polystyrene (EPS) lightweight aggregate concrete: A review Concrete Aggregates; Pumice; Compressive Strength Expanded polystyrene (EPS) is currently being utilized in sustainable materials owing to its ultra-low density and superior thermal performance. It can be incorporated in concrete mixtures to replace coarse aggregate to produce lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC). Concerning the high shrinkage development in LWAC, the present study reviews the available published articles regarding the drying shrinkage of lightweight concretes containing expanded polystyrene. According to the previous studies, the drying shrinkage development in expanded polystyrene concrete (EPSC) has been reported to be greater than that in conventional concrete, which must be considered for its application in the construction industry. It is mainly attributed to the low elastic modulus and mechanical properties of the EPS. However, incorporating additives and fibers can improve its shrinkage resistance properties. A comprehensive comparison of drying shrinkage magnitude between various LWAC showed that the drying shrinkage strain of EPSC is not generally higher than other types of LWAC; however, the density of EPSC was measured lower than that in other types of lightweight aggregate concretes."
"A framework and simple decision support tool for groundwater contamination assessment in an urban redevelopment precinct Brownfield Redevelopment; Brownfields; Contaminated Land Overcoming barriers to large-scale urban redevelopment on brownfield land is an essential step in the global drive toward achieving the UNâ€™s sustainable development goals. Arguably the most significant barrier is site contamination. Decision support tools (DSTs) are potentially effective ways to assess contaminated sites and evaluate different remediation/management strategies as appropriate to local conditions. Whilst there has been extensive development of DSTs for single contaminated sites, only a limited number are available for assessing contamination at the â€˜precinctâ€™ (district) scale. This paper presents a framework and simple DST for the assessment of contaminated groundwater, using Australiaâ€™s largest urban redevelopment project, Fishermans Bend in Melbourne, as a case study. The value of the inclusion of precinct-wide data into individual site-scale investigations is demonstrated via the DST. Common contaminant sources identified across Fishermans Bend include fill contaminated with heavy metals, legacy landfill leachate containing heavy metals and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and naturally occurring ammonia and methane in organic-rich sediments. By comparison, point sources of heavy metals and PFAS appear related to industrial sources. By using the DST, environmental practitioners and auditors can more effectively separate background conditions from point sources, characterise the ambient conditions of the aquifer and their relationships to natural and anthropogenic processes, and use contaminant data to inform remedial options assessment. Where these increasingly complex and varied environmental datasets can be collected, stored and managed within one central database, cross- or inter-disciplinary collaborations may drive improvements in solving environmental problems which typically arise during the redevelopment process."
"How digital natives learn and thrive in the digital age: Evidence from an emerging economy Digital Divide; Internet Use; Education As a generation of 'digital natives,' secondary students who were born from 2002 to 2010 have various approaches to acquiring digital knowledge. Digital literacy and resilience are crucial for them to navigate the digital world as much as the real world; however, these remain under-researched subjects, especially in developing countries. In Vietnam, the education system has put considerable effort into teaching students these skills to promote quality education as part of the United Nations-defined Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4). This issue has proven especially salient amid the COVID??19 pandemic lockdowns, which had obliged most schools to switch to online forms of teaching. This study, which utilizes a dataset of 1061 Vietnamese students taken from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)'s ""Digital Kids Asia Pacific (DKAP)"" project, employs Bayesian statistics to explore the relationship between the students' background and their digital abilities. Results show that economic status and parents' level of education are positively correlated with digital literacy. Students from urban schools have only a slightly higher level of digital literacy than their rural counterparts, suggesting that school location may not be a defining explanatory element in the variation of digital literacy and resilience among Vietnamese students. Students' digital literacy and, especially resilience, also have associations with their gender. Moreover, as students are digitally literate, they are more likely to be digitally resilient. Following SDG4, i.e., Quality Education, it is advisable for schools, and especially parents, to seriously invest in creating a safe, educational environment to enhance digital literacy among students."
"Taking scientific inventions to market: Mapping the academic entrepreneurship ecosystem Entrepreneurial University; Academic Entrepreneurship; Innovation The active contribution of academic institutions to the technological, social and economic development of societies is of increasing importance. To better understand this contribution, we present a systematic review, together with bibliometric and network analyses of the academic entrepreneurship literature. This provides a map of the main topics approached by scholars, thereby illustrating the scientific scenario of the field. Our findings identify three highly interconnected research activity domains that characterize the multidimensional features of entrepreneurship in the academic setting, as well as a significant gap in the literature regarding studies evaluating approaches to support the navigation of potential scientific discoveries to the market. We organize our findings into a four stages framework consisting of: idea inception; the recognition of how this idea unlocks value for customers and other stakeholders; development of an innovative business model; and a commercialization strategy that creates real impact. We discuss the relevance of each stage for the establishment of a more innovation-friendly environment and conclude by offering perspectives into future research opportunities and by encouraging studies that consider the academic entrepreneurship process from a systemic perspective, to support a greater contribution of academic institutions to the economic and social development of the nations and societies."
"A review of nanocellulose as a new material towards environmental sustainability Nanocellulose; Nanocrystal; Nanowhiskers Synthetic polymers, commonly referred to as plastics, are anthropogenic contaminants that adversely affect the natural ecosystems. The continuous disposal of long lifespan plastics has resulted in the accumulation of plastic waste, leading to significant pollution of both marine and terrestrial habitats. Scientific pursuit to seek environment-friendly materials from renewable resources has focused on cellulose, the primary reinforcement component of the cell wall of plants, as it is the most abundantly available biopolymer on earth. This paper provides an overview on the current state of science on nanocellulose research; highlighting its extraction procedures from lignocellulosic biomass. Literature shows that the process used to obtain nanocellulose from lignocellulosic biomass greatly influences its morphology, properties and surface chemistry. The efficacy of chemical methods that use alkali, acid, bleaching agents, ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvent for pre-treatment of biomass is discussed. There has been a continuous endeavour to optimize the pre-treatment protocol as it is specific to lignocellulosic biomass and also depends on factors such as nature of the biomass, process and environmental parameters and economic viability. Nanofibers are primarily isolated through mechanical fibrillation while nanocrystals are predominantly extracted using acid hydrolysis. A concise overview on the ways to improve the yield of nanocellulose from cellulosic biomass is also presented in this review. This work also reviews the techniques used to modify the surface properties of nanocellulose by functionalizing surface hydroxyl groups to impart desirable hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance. An assessment on the emerging application of nanocellulose with an emphasis on development of nanocomposite materials for designing environmentally sustainable products is incorporated. Finally, the status of the industrial production of nanocellulose presented, which indicates that there is a continuously increased demand for cellulose nanomaterials. The demand for cellulose is expected to increase further due to its increasing and broadening applications."
"Towards Sustainable Environmental Quality: Priority Research Questions for the Australasian Region of Oceania Ethinylestradiol; Endocrine Disruptors; Wastewater Treatment Environmental challenges persist across the world, including the Australasian region of Oceania, where biodiversity hotspots and unique ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef are common. These systems are routinely affected by multiple stressors from anthropogenic activities, and increasingly influenced by global megatrends (e.g., the foodâ€“energyâ€“water nexus, demographic transitions to cities) and climate change. Here we report priority research questions from the Global Horizon Scanning Project, which aimed to identify, prioritize, and advance environmental quality research needs from an Australasian perspective, within a global context. We employed a transparent and inclusive process of soliciting key questions from Australasian members of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. Following submission of 78 questions, 20 priority research questions were identified during an expert workshop in Nelson, New Zealand. These research questions covered a range of issues of global relevance, including research needed to more closely integrate ecotoxicology and ecology for the protection of ecosystems, increase flexibility for prioritizing chemical substances currently in commerce, understand the impacts of complex mixtures and multiple stressors, and define environmental quality and ecosystem integrity of temporary waters. Some questions have specific relevance to Australasia, particularly the uncertainties associated with using toxicity data from exotic species to protect unique indigenous species. Several related priority questions deal with the theme of how widely international ecotoxicological data and databases can be applied to regional ecosystems. Other timely questions, which focus on improving predictive chemistry and toxicology tools and techniques, will be important to answer several of the priority questions identified here. Another important question raised was how to protect local cultural and social values and maintain indigenous engagement during problem formulation and identification of ecosystem protection goals. Addressing these questions will be challenging, but doing so promises to advance environmental sustainability in Oceania and globally."
"Understanding high school students use of choice factors and word-of-mouth information sources in university selection College Enrollment; International Students; Hispanic Americans University choice is a high-risk decision for prospective students which requires substantial effort to evaluate a range of choice factors. Understanding this complex process is a crucial task for higher education marketers. Of particular importance are the differences across market segments. This study analyses the importance of choice factors, and the usage of information sources, across domestic/international segments and cross-country segments, and explores which choice factors are delivered via word-of-mouth information sources. Different from previous studies which collected data in the countries of destination, this study employs a data sample of prospective students from the country of origin of Vietnam, an emerging market of international education. The findings provide insight into the key choice factors and information sources by market segment. Future job prospects, teaching quality, staff expertise, and course content were important choice factors across all market segments. Parents are the most influential information source for Vietnamese students."
"A two-stage method using biogeography-based optimization for simultaneous network reconfiguration and renewable energy integration Distribution Network; Reconfiguration; Distributed Generation Renewable Energy Resources (RERs) are a promising source of energy with hardly any pollution. Due to the intermittent nature from the output power of the nondispatchable RER and the load variations in the distribution network, it is important to frequently perform Network Reconfiguration (NR) to minimize the power loss and improve the network's voltage profile. Finding the optimal NR while simultaneously considering the dispatchable RER integration is important but challenging because of the complex combinational nature of the problem, and therefore, it is commonly solved by meta-heuristic techniques. However, the conventional meta-heuristic techniques involve random initializations and normally generate many nonfeasible solutions, which obstruct the search process. With the aim of improving the accuracy and consistency of the solution, this study proposes a two-stage method using biogeography-based optimization to attain the NR simultaneously with the RER placement and sizing for the sake of minimizing power loss and voltage deviation. The first stage simplifies the distribution network and then utilizes the simplified form to provide a better set of initial solutions and to maintain the network radiality. Thereafter, the second stage finds the final NR and RER locations and sizes. The simulations are carried out on 33-bus, 69-bus, and 118-bus systems, and the results are compared with previously published methods and some well-known optimization methods. In addition, load variations and RER's uncertainty are also considered. The obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods. The results also indicate the significance of the hourly NR in reducing power loss."
"Closing the loop: Redesigning sustainable reverse logistics network in uncertain supply chains Closed-Loop Supply Chain; Remanufacturing; Reverse Logistics This paper develops a robust stochastic optimization model for reverse logistics in closed-loop supply chains. By determining the optimal flow of products using a Chance Constrained Robust Stochastic Programming (CCRSP), it is highlighted how the number of plant openings is influenced by the changes in carbon credit price. To assess the model performance, a set of numerical experiments in different sizes are developed and conducted. The effectiveness of the results are then compared to a proposed Heuristic Hybrid Taguchi PSO (HTPSO) solution algorithm, which underlines the effectiveness of the model. A sensitivity analysis on the carbon emission rate is carried out which underlines the role of Carbon Tax Policy. Finally, a real-life case study within the automotive manufacturing industry is carried out by applying the developed robust stochastic model. From a practical standpoint, the model can potentially be employed to meet the carbon credits that are used for handling the different carbon prices and trade scenarios. Also, it provides insights on how to better manage uncertainties, as well as to reduce the overall emissions in supply chains."
"The health consequences of hazardous and nonhazardous child labor Child Labor; Family Characteristic; School Attendance The health consequences of child labor are ambiguous. On the one hand, heavy lifting, using dangerous tools and handling fertilizers may impact negatively on health. On the other, child labor could be used to achieve a minimal subsistence standard, without which the child could experience deteriorating health. Previous empirical studies are inconclusive because, until now, existing data sources could not disentangle between different activities performed by child workers. To establish how work is related to health, it is essential to know what activities are being performed. This study fills this gap with a unique child labor survey conducted in Peru in 2015. Child labor is classified into hazardous and nonhazardous activities. The econometric results suggest that children doing nonhazardous work are less likely to have health problems than nonworking children. Conversely, those that work in hazardous activities are potentially more likely to exhibit health concerns. A series of robustness tests confirm these findings. The results give impetus to the notion that child work increases total resources available for households, which can improve child health. Therefore, it is over and above this potential increment in resources that some hazardous activities worsen working children's health."
"Renewable energy in Bangladesh: current situation and future prospect Energy; Energy Poverty; Fuelwood Energy insufficiency is obstructing the socio-economic and industrial improvement of Bangladesh. Renewable energy contributes about 560 Megawatt (MW) of the total electricity production of 20,430 MW, which can be a sustainable solution to the demand-supply crisis. This paper, summarises the current energy situation of Bangladesh and examines the available renewable energy resources and their future prospect. It has been revealed that Bangladesh is heavily (62%) relying on natural gas although government has already taken steps to generate electricity from renewable energy sources. Current policies and legislations related to generation of renewable energy in Bangladesh have been discussed explicitly. Finally, some suggestions have been made to tackle the ongoing energy crisis in the country, in addition to the renewable energy.Abbreviations: GDP: Gross domestic product; RNPP: Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant; Tcf: Trillion cubic feet; IDCOL: Infrastructure development company limited; BPDB: Bangladesh Power Development Board: GS: Grameen Shakti; BWDB: Bangladesh Water Development Board: USD: United States Dollar; IPP: Independent power producer: BCAS: Bangladesh center for advanced studies; NWPGCL: North West Power Generation Company Limited: BCSIR: Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research; EGCB: Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh: WRA: Wind Resource Assessment; REB: Rural Electrification Board: BRAC: Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee; kW: Kilowatt: PJ: Petajoules; MW: Megawatt: IFRAD: Institute for fuel research and Development; GWh: Gigawatt hours: ICS: Improved Cooking Stoves; MWh: Megawatt hours: DoE: Department of Environment; TWh: Trillion-watt hour: DLS: Department of Livestock Services; RPCL: Rural Power Company Limited: mmcfd: million cubic feet per day; APSCL: Ashugang Power Station Company Limited: BSCIC: Bangladesh Small & Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC); GOB: Government of Bangladesh: BADC: Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation; SREDA: Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority: DIDA: Danish International Development Agency; LGED: Local Government Engineering Directorate: BAU: Bangladesh Agricultural University; NGO: Non-Governmental Organization: HBRI: Housing & Building Research Institute; IRENA: International Renewable energy Agency: : BARD: Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development; ETP: Electronic Traffic Pricing: BCCD: Bangladesh Commission for Christian Development; PV: Photovoltaic: BRRI: Bangladesh Rice Research Institute; SHS: Solar Home Systems: NDBMP: National Domestic Biogas and Manure Program; TOE: Tonne of oil equivalent: K/km: Kelvin/kilometer; LEAP: Long range Energy Alternative Planning."
"A Call for Evaluation of Restorative Justice Programs Restorative Justice; Offender-Victim Mediation; Criminal Law Restorative justice as a response to sexual violence continues to be subject to significant criticism. To assess the evidence, we sought to appraise and synthesize evaluations of restorative justice programs for sexual and family violence offences by conducting a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature. However, our rigorous search identified only one eligible study. This dearth of evidence leaves us unable to identify how best to achieve the aims for which programs were established and poses difficulties for policy makers determining whether it is justified to introduce restorative justice programs for sexual and family violence. We recommend that evaluations of restorative justice programs that accept sexual and family violence cases be conducted as a matter of urgency."
"Reconfiguring maritime networks due to the Belt and Road Initiative: impact on bilateral trade flows Container Port; Short Sea Shipping; Harbors (Waterways) This paper aims to analyse the potential effects on bilateral trade movements of the reconfiguration of maritime networks brought about by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The gravity model of international trade is applied to examine the hypothesized impact of maritime network reconfiguration on the bilateral trade between nine exporting countries (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Panama, Colombia, Costa Rica, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia) and their 128 trading partners. The panel data on the five components of the Liner Shipping Bilateral Connectivity Index, the export value, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the nine exporting countries, the GDP of their trading partners and the maritime distance linking them to these 128 trading partners for each of the years from 2008 to 2016 are used in the analysis. The results show that the estimated coefficient for the number of transhipments is negative, revealing an inverse relationship between transhipments and bilateral exports, reconfirming that a redesign of the maritime supply chain network in response to the BRI could significantly improve bilateral export values. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of required transhipments, because of a reconfiguration of maritime networks with BRI trading partners, will improve the maritime network structure between countries located along the three strategic chokepoints: the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, and the Strait of Malacca. In general terms, the BRI-driven reconfiguration of maritime supply networks is linked to an improvement in the productivity of nine exporting countries. An innovative gravity-based econometric model, estimated on a large set of panel data, is introduced below, aiming at the modelling of the effect of BRI on supply chain network reconfiguration."
"Achieving ‘Active’ 30 Minute Cities: How Feasible Is It to Reach Work within 30 Minutes Using Active Transport Modes? Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Confronted with rapid urbanization, population growth, traffic congestion, and climate change, there is growing interest in creating cities that support active transport modes including walking, cycling, or public transport. The â€˜30 minute cityâ€™, where employment is accessible within 30 min by active transport, is being pursued in some cities to reduce congestion and foster local living. This paper examines the spatial relationship between employment, the skills of residents, and transport opportunities, to answer three questions about Australiaâ€™s 21 largest cities: (1) What percentage of workers currently commute to their workplace within 30 min? (2) If workers were to shift to an active transport mode, what percent could reach their current workplace within 30 min? and (3) If it were possible to relocate workers closer to their employment or relocate employment closer to their home, what percentage could reach work within 30 min by each mode? Active transport usage in Australia is low, with public transport, walking, and cycling making up 16.8%, 2.8%, and 1.1% respectively of workersâ€™ commutes. Cycling was found to have the most potential for achieving the 30 min city, with an estimated 29.5% of workers able to reach their current workplace were they to shift to cycling. This increased to 69.1% if workers were also willing and able to find a similar job closer to home, potentially reducing commuting by private motor vehicle from 79.3% to 30.9%."
"Comparison of alternative methods for managing the residual of material recovery facilities using life cycle assessment Solid Waste Management; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal Solid Waste Excessive waste generation caused by exponential growth in resource use for the production of consumer goods, electronics and packaging has placed a growing burden on waste management globally. In Australia, waste is currently generated at a rate of 43 million tonne per annum and has a projected growth rate of 4.5% per annum. Diminishing landfill capacity adds to the pressure faced by governments to consider alternative waste technologies put forward by industry. In Australia, residual waste from material recovery facilities is under consideration by energy and waste companies for alternative management by waste-to-energy. This waste is not feasible to be efficiently separated for further processing. In this study, the environmental performance of the material recovery facilitiesâ€™ residual waste based in Sydney, Australia, is assessed using a life cycle assessment that estimates the potential impacts of acidification, climate change, eutrophication and photochemical oxidation. A sensitivity analysis tests different waste fractions of MRF residual waste composition. The study found that landfill had the lowest greenhouse gas emissions regardless of whether credits offset electricity, and of the carbon accounting methods used to measure biogenic carbon dioxide. The results also found landfill to have the lowest acidifying emissions but found the waste-to-energy technologies performed better in minimizing euthrophying and photochemical oxidation emissions. Aggregated by normalization and weightings, landfilling was found to have the lowest single score. The study reported electricity generation potentials through thermal turbine, synthetic gas engine and landfill gas combustion, and found incineration to have highest electricity generation potential, followed by gasification-pyrolysis."
"Energy poverty and obesity Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Obesity is a major health concern in both developed and developing nations. Yet, evidence on the determinants of obesity is relatively limited. We contribute to the literature on the determinants of obesity by empirically examining the effects of energy poverty on obesity. Using 14 waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, we find energy poverty is positively associated with obesity. Applying linear probability model, our estimates suggest that being energy poor results between 1.4 and 2.5 percentage points increase in the probability of being obese, depending on how energy poverty is measured. Our results are robust to alternative modelling techniques, inclusion of additional control variables and potential influence of unobservable. We also find that amount of sleep, health status and level of psychological distress are important transmission channels through which energy poverty influences the probability of being obese."
"Emerging investigator series: Phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater by adsorption on steelmaking slag preceding forward osmosis: An integrated process Phosphate Removal; Adsorbents; Adsorption Phosphorus is a critical non-renewable mineral essential for sustainable crop production. However, it is a primary cause of eutrophication in natural water bodies. Hence, a pragmatic approach that allows wastewater treatment plants to efficiently recover phosphorus from wastewater is needed. In this study, we investigated phosphorus recovery from municipal wastewater using an industrial waste product (steelmaking slag) as an adsorbent to selectively separate phosphorus from wastewater before its concentration by the forward osmosis (FO) process. Phosphorus adsorbed on slag was extracted, thereby regenerating the adsorbent medium. The resulting phosphorus-rich solution was further enriched by FO prior to chemical precipitation for phosphorus recovery. Batch test results showed that the equilibrium of phosphorus sorption on the slag medium was achieved within 45 min with an adsorption capacity of 3.8 mg g-1. In continuous-flow column tests, the slag exhibited a stable phosphorus removal efficiency of 82% from wastewater, following which approximately 88% of the phosphate could be extracted from the adsorbent medium. When the phosphorus-rich solution extracted from the adsorbent was passed through the FO membrane, FO could retain 98% of the phosphate. However, the water flux through the FO membrane declined gradually to approximately 20% of the initial value at a water recovery of 90%, which could be attributed to the increasingly concentrated feed solution. The enrichment of phosphate in the concentrated feed by the FO process provided a favorable condition for spontaneous precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphate. This study demonstrates that the proposed combined adsorption-FO process can effectively remove, and thus recover, phosphorus from municipal wastewater."
"Unconditional cash transfers, child labour and education: theory and evidence Child Labor; Family Characteristic; School Attendance We examine the impact of unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) on child labour and educational outcomes. We first develop a simple theoretical model where we explore how government transfers financed by labour income taxation affect household decisions on child labour and education. We then empirically examine the impact of Pakistan's Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), which is the largest cash transfer program in South Asia, on child labour and school outcomes. We employ a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to estimate the average effect of the UCTs on child labour and school outcomes, and find that UCTs have a positive and statistically significant impact on school enrolment and grade promotion, but no impact on school dropout rates in the short run. The BISP policy intervention increases grade promotion amongst boys but not amongst girls. In the short run, the BISP substantially reduces dropout for boys but increases substantially for girls. With regards to child labour, we find that the BISP policy intervention has no impact on child labour in the short run; but in the medium to long run, cash transfers help to reduce child labour amongst boys as well as girls. In the short run, however, the BISP increases child labour amongst girls but not boys. These findings are largely consistent with our theoretical predictions and also robust to a series of robustness and sensitivity checks."
"A global review of consumer behavior towards e-waste and implications for the circular economy E-Waste; Electronic Waste; Electronic Equipment To tackle the alarming increase in e-waste or end-of-life (EoL) electronic products, consumer behavior towards the end of their useful life needs to be thoroughly studied. End users or consumers are the starting point where e-waste starts its journey into several paths within the circular economy (CE), such as repair, reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling. E-waste often ends up in landfill due to improper disposal of e-waste with household waste by consumers. Studying consumer behavior allows for the identification of appropriate approaches to achieve CE. Numerous academic journal papers have been published concerning consumers' e-waste-related knowledge and awareness, and behavior on consumption, disposal, storage, recycling, and repair. Substantial knowledge gap exists around how understandings of consumer behavior around e-waste may be integrated into the CE model. This article aims to reduce this gap by reviewing 109 research papers published in international peer-reviewed journals identified in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection database, using content analysis methodology to analyze and review the articles. The study aims to provide invaluable input for developing a more consumer-centric CE framework for both policymakers and researchers seeking to advance knowledge and implementation strategies around e-waste. This is one of the earliest systematic reviews of studies on consumer behavior around e-waste. The study results show that consumers' disposal and recycling behaviors are the two main areas of research interest in the studies reviewed. In contrast, reuse and repair behavior were investigated to a lesser extent. In this study, several research gaps and areas for future research are identified, along with suggestions for a CE framework focusing on the e-waste sector that, encompasses policy initiatives and business model innovations. The identified studies presented here offer a valuable starting point for researchers who are starting to work on consumer behavior-related e-waste research."
"African women’s experience of domestic violence and help-seeking behaviour in Melbourne, Australia Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Help-Seeking This study explored African refugee background womenâ€™s experience of domestic violence and help-seeking behaviour. The women were part of a domestic violence prevention and intervention project run by a local community organisation. Underpinned by help-seeking frameworks such as Theory of Planned Behaviour, data were gathered via two focus group interviews with seventeen women in Melbourne, Australia. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. The results showed that participants experienced different forms of violence. Many did not seek help early, and help-seeking was constrained by cultural considerations and children in the relationship. Implications are discussed in relation to formal and informal support or interventions."
"Biological Control of the Noxious Weed Angled Onion (Allium triquetrum) Thwarted by Endophytic Bacteria in Victoria, Australia Quorum Sensing; Pseudomonas Aeruginosa; N-Octanoylhomoserine Lactone The noxious weed Allium triquetrum (Alliaceae) has invaded widespread areas in southern Australia, forming dense monocultures that threaten indigenous ground flora. Two soilborne biocontrol agents, the fungus Stromatinia cepivora and the bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Pcc) have previously been reported as killing A. triquetrum in gnotobiotic controlled conditions. This study aimed to find why glasshouse pot trials in complex potting media and field trials showed no effect of inoculation with either agent. Bacteria were consistently isolated from inside surface-sterilised bases and bulbs of A. triquetrum. Most bacteria from actively growing plants were closely related to Bacillus but one from dormant bulbs (RPTAtOch1) belonged to Ochrobactrum. Most bacteria reduced soft rot caused by Pcc in vitro by up to 100% when inoculated the day before Pcc. Co-cultivation with Pcc reduced its extracellular pectin lyase and polygalacturonase, which target plant cell walls. RPTAtOch1 was identified as O. quorumnocens by traditional physiological, biochemical and molecular tests, whole genome sequencing and Average Nucleotide Identity comparisons. Its draft genome consisted of 76 contigs, 70% of which were closest to isolate A44 of O. quorumnocens, which antagonises soft rotting of potato by Pcc by destroying its quorum-sensing lactones but, like RPTAtOch1, does not inhibit growth of Pcc. Also, endophytic bacteria inhibited germination of S. cepivora sclerotia and so prevented white rot. Thus, the failure in biocontrol of A. triquetrum by both S. cepivora and Pcc may be due, ironically, to biocontrol of the intended pathogens by endophytic bacteria inside the target weed."
"Effect of Rhizome Fragment Length and Burial Depth on the Emergence of a Tropical Invasive Weed Cyperus aromaticus (Navua Sedge) Cirsium Arvense; Algicide; Perennial Weeds Cyperus aromaticus (Navua sedge) is a problematic perennial weed in pastures and crops including sugarcane, banana, rice, and fruits and vegetables in tropical climates. It reproduces both via rhizomes and seeds. As a regenerative and storage organ, these rhizomes play an important part in the invasion, establishment, and persistence of this weed. To eliminate their regenerative ability, it is important to understand the regrowth potential with respect to rhizome fragment size and burial depth. This study evaluated the emergence of C. aromaticus from rhizomes in a controlled condition. Three different sizes of rhizome fragments were buried at seven depths of up to 20 cm in two soil types. The experimental measurements included (i) the time for tillers to emerge, (ii) the cumulative emergence of tillers, recorded weekly, and (iii) the number of underground emerging tillers. The cumulative shoot emergence and the number of underground tillers produced were found to be positively correlated with the initial length of the rhizome fragments and negatively correlated with the burial depth. The time for the emergence of the tillers was negatively correlated with the burial depth, and soil type had no significant effect on any of the parameters recorded. There was no emergence recorded from rhizomes buried at 15 cm depth and deeper, irrespective of their size. Our results indicate that the combination of the fragmentation of rhizomes into small pieces and a deep burial, below 15 cm, is an important aspect to control the regeneration of C. aromaticus from rhizomes, if tillage is carried out, and can therefore form a part of an integrated weed management strategy for this troublesome weed."
"Australian farmers left behind in the digital economy – Insights from the Australian Digital Inclusion Index Digital Divide; Broadband; Digitalisation Although Australia's population is concentrated in major urban centres along its coastal fringe, its less populous rural communities are important to society and the economyâ€”supporting sectors like agriculture, which occupies over half the continent's land mass and accounts for 2.2% of value added gross domestic product (GDP) (Jackson et al., 2020). The vast distances between urban and rural centres present challenges to the provision of essential infrastructure like roads, transport, energy â€“ and telecommunications. Within this last category, internet connectivity and skills are both increasingly necessary and historically less available to the regional and rural agricultural sector in comparison to other industries and geographic communities. The digital inclusion agenda in Australia aims to address such gaps by promoting and supporting people and communities to use technology to improve social and economic well-being. This article builds on research underpinning the Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII), which defines digital inclusion as the capacity of people to access, afford and use online technologies effectively. The article focuses on the nature and extent of digital inclusion for Australia's farmers (identified as farmers and farm managers) based on analysis of a customised set of primary data extracted from the ADII dataset. This analysis reveals generally low levels of digital inclusion in rural communities, particularly among farmers, with distinctive and complex characteristics across measures of Access, Affordability and Digital Ability. Our findings highlight a perplexing scenario in which farmers score poorly on the Index when compared to Australians who live in similar circumstances but are not employed in the farming sector. We attribute lower levels of access to limited internet technology options, lower data speeds, inadequate reliability and lower data allowances. Less affordability is associated with individual-level socioeconomic factors, along with lack of competition between service providers in sparse population areas, the comparative cost of building telecommunications infrastructure in the bush, and the need for redundancy in rural and remote solutions. Finally, lower digital ability scores reflect social, cultural and material practices on farms that have produced distinctive orientations to technology. We conclude the article by explaining the contributions of the paper to digital inclusion research and by making recommendations for policy development."
"Responsible use of technology to combat cyberbullying among young people Cyberbullying; Crime Victims; Workplace Bullying Cyberbullying has become a major challenge for authorities, parents, guardians and schools in particular, especially in the era of the digital world. This paper reviews available empirical research to examine the issues such as the responsible use of technology amongst young people, parents and schools responsibility to protect against Cyberbullying. The analysis revealed that the responsible use of technology provides better practices to encourage comparisons because of these new digital technologies. Parents and educators are the key to Cyber ethics, therefore teaching the responsible use of technology whilst focusing on Cyber ethics at the start of young people's exposure to technology use may be an excellent strategy to reduce the growth and impact of Cyberbullying. The paper will also review good practices for young people, school communities and parents to prevent and manage Cyberbullying and unethical behaviours online. These claims are examined using current literature to ensure a better understanding of responsible use of technology and understanding of Cyberbullying in order to support young people to combat this immerging societal challenge."
"Effect of COVID-19 response policies on walking behavior in US cities Dietary Habits; Physical Activity Levels; COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic is causing mass disruption to our daily lives. We integrate mobility data from mobile devices and area-level data to study the walking patterns of 1.62 million anonymous users in 10 metropolitan areas in the United States. The data covers the period from mid-February 2020 (pre-lockdown) to late June 2020 (easing of lockdown restrictions). We detect when users were walking, distance walked and time of the walk, and classify each walk as recreational or utilitarian. Our results reveal dramatic declines in walking, particularly utilitarian walking, while recreational walking has recovered and even surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Our findings also demonstrate important social patterns, widening existing inequalities in walking behavior. COVID-19 response measures have a larger impact on walking behavior for those from low-income areas and high use of public transportation. Provision of equal opportunities to support walking is key to opening up our society and economy."
"Conditions for Effective Coproduction in Community-Led Disaster Risk Management Co-Production; Public Services; Governance This paper reports on a case study of collective coproduction in an Australian community-based disaster risk management (CBDRM) project called â€œBe Ready Warrandyteâ€. The first goal of the case study was to understand what interactions and power-sharing between citizens and government â€œlooked and felt likeâ€ in a significant example of community-led CBDRM in an Australian context. Its second, broader goal was to test the extent to which foundational coproduction theory, specifically four conditions proposed by Elinor Ostrom for enabling coproduction that is more effective than either government or citizen production alone, can explain the citizen-government interactions, roles and contributions that enable successful community-led CBDRM. The study confirms that each of the four conditionsâ€”complementarity, authority, incentives and credible commitmentâ€”also apply to community-led as well as government-led initiatives. It reinforces the central importance of complementarity for avoiding offloading of risk, responsibility and cost to citizens from government, while also suggesting that specific sources of internal and external authority, incentives, and credible commitment are especially important when coproduction is community-led. It identifies leadership and its impacts on government-citizen relationships and power-sharing in coproduction as an important area that needs further research."
"Use of bitumen encapsulated cigarette butts in stone mastic asphalt Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens Around the world, 75 percent of smokers do not dispose of their cigarette butts properly, thereby resulting in a large amount of mephitic waste cigarette butts (CBs) being dumped into the environment. Waste CBs take years to decompose with most containing a cellulose-acetate based filter, tar, nicotine, tobacco, and many highly toxic chemicals that leach into the soil and water bodies and cause contamination and toxicity. Mohajerani et al. in 2017 developed the encapsulation method for cigarette butts and investigated the incorporation of bitumen and wax encapsulated cigarette butts in dense asphalt concrete. This research work investigated the possible recycling of bitumen encapsulated CBs in stone mastic asphalt (SMA). Waste CBs were processed and encapsulated with bitumen class PMB A10E. Stone mastic asphalt samples were prepared by replacing coarse aggregates by 1%, 2%, and 3% (by weight) with bitumen encapsulated CBs. Marshall stability, flow, resilient modulus, and volumetric properties of SMA manufactured samples were investigated and the results were compared with those of the control SMA samples prepared without CBs. The experimental procedures and some of the significant outcomes of the study, along with some results from a leachate analysis have been presented and discussed. Average results show that the use of encapsulated CBs in Stone Mastic Asphalt samples manufactured in this study improved the stability and resistance to permanent deformation. Furthermore, the leaching of heavy metals from encapsulated CBs compared with those of unprocessed CBs reduced significantly. Based on the promising results found in this study, further investigations, and development of practical implementation procedures for recycling cigarette butts in asphalt concrete on an industrial scale are recommended."
"Smells like politics: planning and the inconvenient politics of intensive peri-urban agriculture Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems Intensive farming is an increasing part of Australian agriculture, including in the multi-functional landscapes at the edges of Australian cities. The example of intensive â€œbroilerâ€ poultry production reveals the tensions that arise when sites of hyper-productivity conflict with social change in rural areas. Planning processes for intensive farming in the Australian state of Victoria are predicated on stability and consensus: on assumed static and uncontroversial ideas of agriculture, its place, and the primacy of agricultural productivity. Yet concerns about the industrialisation of agriculture are live political issues at the local level, especially in dynamic peri-urban locations. This paper explores the emergence of a politics of place outside the bounds of planning consensus through an analysis of planning appeals and associated media relating to planning permits for intensive poultry developments in Victoria over 2011â€“2016. We highlight tensions that exist in relation to technical planning assessments and categorisations used to assert farming as the orthodox use of rural land, especially when new forms of farming look and feel demonstrably different. Using Mouffe's problematising of the negation of antagonism and RanciÃ¨re's notion of the risks of a false consensus democracy, we argue that planning processes for intensive farming illustrate critical issues in participatory planning. While ostensibly post-political decision-making narrows the politics of place and food systems to decisions about policing the boundaries and buffer distances placed around intensive poultry developments, alternative representations of rural life persist. The certainty offered by code-based planning does not negate the ongoing (if inconvenient) politics of intensive peri-urban agriculture."
"The application of Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus as a bioaugmentation agent for the enhanced treatment of non-sterile fish wastewater Activated Sludge; Batch Reactors; Salinity Wastewaters generated by fish processing are characterised by salt concentrations similar to or greater than that of seawater together with high nutrient concentrations (e.g. organic carbon and total nitrogen) due to the presence of blood, oil, and fish tissues. Fish processing wastewater entering rivers and oceans have become a key factor leading to the pollution of receiving waters; the adequate treatment of this wastewater is, therefore, crucial to a sustainable fish industry. The present study aimed to determine whether augmentation of fish wastewater with either Marinirhabdus sp., Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus or a consortium of the two halobacteria, could successfully enhance the removal of both chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) from fish wastewater. Following 9 days of incubation, the bioaugmentation treatment resulted in a significant reduction in COD, 88%, 91%, and 92% in fish wastewater augmented with either Marinirhabdus sp., Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus respectively, or a consortium of the two halobacteria compared with the control (non-bioaugmented) treatment (77% removal). In tall bioaugmentation treatments (79â€“88%) TN removal was also significantly greater than the control treatment (57%). After 9 days of incubation, the COD and TN in bioaugmentation reached the European Union's (EU) wastewater discharge standard (Level B, COD < 120 mg Lâˆ’1, TN < 70 mg Lâˆ’1). The addition of monoculture was effective in enhancing the removal of COD, while co-culture significantly improved TN removal. Results of 16S rDNA sequence analysis investigating the survival of these introduced bacteria showed that only Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus was detected at the end of the treatment, constituting 36% of the total bacterial population when added alone to the wastewater. This study confirms the effectiveness of bioaugmentation in removing COD and TN in saline fish wastewater. The ability of Marinobacter hydrocarbonclasticus to enhance the treatment and dominate the bacterial community suggests the commercial potential of this organism for bioaugmentation of aquaculture wastewater without the need for further bioaugmentation."
"Gold Coast smart city strategy: Informed by local planning priorities and international smart city best practices Smart Cities; Big Data; Internet of Things This paper takes an applied approach to propose a smart city strategy informed by local planning priorities and international best practices. In doing so, it focuses on Gold Coast - a midsized Coastal City in Australia - which has been part of IBM's smarter cities challenge, and open and agile smart cities network. In this paper, local planning context and priorities in relation to smart cities are investigated, and benchmarked against best practice smart city initiatives from around the world. The result is a strategic smart city framework around organisational and operational capital, economic and financial capital, human and social capital, infrastructure and physical capital. The approach taken, and the lessons learned are applicable to other cities interested in taking a strategic approach towards the fast growing concept of smart cities."
