"Board gender diversity and corporate carbon commitment: Does industry matter? Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence The study examines whether board gender diversity is associated with corporate carbon commitment, and if so, whether the association varies between firms operating in the extractive and non-extractive industries. Based on insights drawn from gender socialization, resource dependence, and critical mass theories, we develop models that link board gender diversity with corporate carbon commitment. Analyzing data obtained from Standard and Poor's 1500 firms, for the period 2015 to 2019, we find that higher representation of women on a firm's board is positively associated with the firm's carbon commitment and that the association is stronger for firms in the extractive industries. Furthermore, a nominal appointment of women to a firm's board reduces the likelihood of the firm's carbon commitment being at a given or higher level, while the appointment of a â€œcritical massâ€ of women to the board increases the firm's inclination toward higher carbon commitment. Our findings suggest that regulatory and policymaking agencies could exploit legislative and policy initiatives that would promote board gender diversity to encourage corporates, especially those operating in the extractive industries, to commit to the climate change cause."
"“It just fits my needs better”: Autistic students and parents’ experiences of learning from home during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic Autism; Children with Developmental Disabilities; Caregivers Background and aims: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to people's lives, especially for families, whose children have been taken out of schools during lockdown restrictions and required to learn from home. Little is known, however, about the perceived impact of the lockdown restrictions on the educational experiences of autistic children and young people â€“ a group whose conventional schooling experiences are already often challenging. In this study, we sought to (1) understand these experiences from the perspectives of autistic young people and their parents, and (2) identify the underlying sources of positive experiences at this challenging time, in order to inform the ways in which autistic children might flourish at school in more normal times. Methods: Ninety-one Australian participants, including 16 autistic young people aged 12â€“18 years, 32 autistic parents and 43 non-autistic parents of autistic young people aged 3â€“18 years, took part in semi-structured interviews about their experiences of life during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The interviews were subjected to reflexive, thematic analysis to identify themes and subthemes for each research question. Results: Overall, our participants initially found the transition to learning from home extremely challenging, with parents reporting that the support received from schools was far from adequate. After that initial period of transition, however, many autistic children reported flourishing at home both educationally and personally. For these children and families, we identified three key ingredients essential to this flourishing, including: (i) the importance of connected, trusting relationships (â€˜peopleâ€™); (ii) the sensory and social safety of home (â€˜placeâ€™); and (iii) the flexibility to pace and structure learning to suit the individual child (â€˜timeâ€™). Conclusions: While the initial COVID-19 lockdown presented many challenges to children learning at home, there were aspects of this otherwise-unsettling situation that enabled children to thrive and from which we can learn for the future. Implications: These findings have important implications for understanding how and when autistic children might thrive in institutional educational settings once the pandemic subsides, focusing on the relationships between teachers and students, the nature of the physical learning environment and the need for greater flexibility in planning the school day."
"Towards space science education: A study of students’ perceptions of the role and value of a space science program Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development The field of Space has become very important in the wake of opportunities and strategic advantages accrued from it. It has become increasingly evident that space science education is beginning to gain grounds in the 21st century and it is perceived to bring about Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) awareness providing a context for teaching and learning of the subject. The competitive nature of Space means developing nations will need to invest in the skills that the industry needs by way of sustained pathways, incentivised research and development, and assured a favourable prevailing business environment by way of creating capacities and capabilities in space sciences. Through an explanatory study, we draw on studentsâ€™ responses (N = 504, interviews = 20) to investigate the educational need of a space science program. Findings revealed implications for the quality and function of a space science program which provide a platform for engagement in space related research and development. Data also demonstrated key facts with the potential of increasing the future of space science instruction which will necessitate a paradigm shift towards the value of space education in the phase of integrating a space science program in the curriculum. The paper concludes with recommendations for practitioners responsible for integration of new curriculum in science education in higher education sectors."
"Reforming defences to murder, an Australian case study Provocation; Homicide; Sentencing This chapter assesses the effectiveness of feminist-led reforms to the law of murder introduced in the Australian state of Victoria. Since the late twentieth century, feminist legal scholars and activists in Australia and other anglophone jurisdictions have criticised the gendered operation of defences to murder in intimate partner homicides cases. Significantly, one was anticipated by the Law Reform Commission when it considered the merits of abolishing that defence. Gendered narratives resurfaced in sentencing pleas in post-reform cases, particularly where the defence counsel argued that the killing was the result of a â€˜loss of controlâ€™ in response to his partner or ex-partnerâ€™s actions or that it occurred in the context of the defendantâ€™s emotional stress. So while the defence counsel explicitly argued that provocation should be a mitigating factor at sentencing, they frequently argued something very similar, notably that the loss of self-control occurred after a cumulative build-up of mental stress due to the victimâ€™s behaviour over a period of time."
"Implementing OPCAT through prison monitoring: the relevance of rehabilitation Convention Against Torture; Equality; Degrading Punishment The purposes of imprisonment are always debated but it is expected that people leaving prison are changed such that they do not reoffend: that they are rehabilitated. Indeed the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights spells out rehabilitation as the â€˜essential aimâ€™ of imprisonment. Rehabilitation in the prison context may involve (for example) provision of education, training, work experience, addressing offending behaviours, and maintaining family contacts. Yet Australian prison statistics show that our prisons are not proving rehabilitative, and specifically are not preventing reoffending. Ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT) requires establishment of comprehensive monitoring frameworks to prevent â€˜torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatmentâ€™ in places of detention. This article examines the scope for the inclusion of rehabilitation in prison monitoring under OPCAT. It makes the argument that the rehabilitative orientation of a prison is linked to the risk of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and that prevention of such treatment requires attention to whether the prison is â€˜rehabilitativeâ€™. It concludes that Australian jurisdictions should ensure the widest scope for OPCAT monitoring to support the rehabilitative goal of Australian prisons."
"Significance of implementing decentralized biogas solutions in india: A viable pathway for biobased economy Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production In recent years, world economy has achieved considerable economic and social development, but this has resulted in the widespread degradation and depletion of our natural environment. Solid-waste generation increases exponentionally due to the rapid urbanization, but inappropriate waste handling causes health hazards and urban environment degradation. The goal of strengthening bio-based economy is potentially related to biogas solutions with respect to solid waste management in several ways. Bio based economy demands new ways of philosophy and co-opera-tion within and across sectors to minimise the environmental footprint and climate change throughout the value chain. The range and significance of biogas technologies has increased rapidly during the last 30 years for the treatment of organic waste. The typical way of perceiving the role of biogas solutions is as a last step in cascading the biomass where renewable energy in the form of biogas is produced along with bio-fertiliser. Among the existing technologies for waste treatment, anaerobic digestion (AD) plays a key role in reducing waste along with the generation of renewable energy as it plays a key role in reducing the adverse effects on environmental and climatic changes of the biosphere such as the reduction of NOx and CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, leading to reduced carbon foot print and reduction in solid waste accumulation. However, AD of organic waste with conventional digesters is not practicable for the processing of large quantities of waste generated in India. The aim of the present work is to present knowledge and technological gaps between slow rate and high rate biogas solutions that emerged in India, used to replace conventional fuels with renewable and green fuel (biogas) through initiatives taken up by the governmental and private organizations."
"Navigating the neighbourhood: gender, place and agency in children’s mobility Report Cards; Mode Choice; Built Environment Children have an intrinsic right to urban space. Yet childrenâ€™s perspectives and agency are largely absent from research and public policy on issues that concern them. Common conceptualisations of children as vulnerable, incompetent, or unruly designate their marginalised status in the city. When gender is added, the deficit approach is reinforced. In this paper, we draw from theoretical and methodological approaches that affirm childrenâ€™s agency and focus analytical attention on how gendered spatialities are performed. Using cognitive mapping and semi-structured interviews with children aged eleven and twelve in Melbourne, Australia, the study explored the ways in which childrenâ€™s relationships with their neighbourhoods reflect, reproduce and resist gendered spatialities. We demonstrate that children are skilled â€˜spatial agentsâ€™, actively producing spatialities with awareness and intention, and clear gendered embodiment. Our analysis indicates the importance of engaging children in urban design and considering intersections of gender, age and power in contemporary cities."
"Perceptions towards entrepreneurship and intention to become entrepreneurs: The case of Sultan Qaboos university female undergraduate students Entrepreneurial Intention; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship This chapter reports the results of a study conducted on Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) female undergraduate studentsâ€™ intentions on becoming entrepreneurs and their perceptions towards entrepreneurship. This study employed predictive modelling to understand and predict the start of own business by female students in a developing country like Oman. The key research question addressed in this chapter is: What factors influence Sultan Qaboos Universityâ€™s female students towards entrepreneurship? Using a questionnaire survey, data were collected from 200 undergraduate female students at the College of Economics and Political Science in 2015. The findings suggest that, while the general perceptions on factors that influence the entrepreneurial aspirations of female SQU undergraduate students are positive, a small portion of these students still hold ambivalent views towards entrepreneurship. This research has important implications for researchers, practitioners, policy makers and entrepreneurship educators."
"Musical genius and/or nasty piece of work? Dealing with violence and sexual assault in accounts of popular music’s past Cultural Heritage; Archival Science; Forms and Records Control For many years, the mistreatment of women in particular has essentially been normalized in many parts of the music industry. In recent years, however, there has been an increase in women coming forward and telling their stories, and asking that men be held accountable for wrongdoing. This interdisciplinary (sociology and philosophy) paper pursues two key feminist questions prompted by recent developments. Firstly: How has the construction of the history of popular music legitimated the continuation of this situation? â€˜Looking backâ€™ historically and sociologically, examples are provided of the legitimation or ignoring of violence against women (VAW) in the history of popular music to date. Secondly: How should we [archivists, historians, heritage curators and popular music educators], from now on, construct the history of popular music in a way that doesnâ€™t legitimate VAW? Turning to â€˜look forwardâ€™, applied ethics frameworks are used to explore different aspects of this second question."
"The impact of ethnic diversity on microenterprise start-ups Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion Until recently, factors determining the decisions made by microfinance institutions (MFIs) to extend loans to business start-ups had not been explored. Recent evidence shows that MFI performance with regard to funds issued for small business start-ups depends on MFI-level characteristics such as profit orientation. We argue that these decisions do not only depend on MFI-specific practices or characteristics, but also on the role ethnic diversity plays. Using data on microfinance lending activities for business start-ups, we examine the impact of ethnic diversity on microenterprise start-ups. Results show that ethnic diversity negatively affects the provision of financial capital for business start-up. Furthermore, results also suggest a negative association between ethnic diversity and the share of female borrowers recorded by MFIs. We examine social networks and outreach as potential channels through which ethnic diversity affects business start-ups."
"Accounting as Technical, Social and Moral Practice: The Monetary Valuation of Public Cultural, Heritage and Scientific Collections in Financial Reports Accrual Accounting; International Public Sector Accounting Standards; Local Government The International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board of the International Federation of Accountants issued exposure draft ED78 Property Plant and Equipment in April 2021. It proposes valuing â€˜heritage itemsâ€™ for recognition as â€˜heritage assetsâ€™ in statements of financial position. This proposed requirement for global application casts the spotlight on a highly controversial topic in regulated financial reporting. The monetary valuation of cultural, heritage and scientific collections of public not-for-profit museums, art galleries and similar repositories has been subject to considerable discussion and debate for the past three decades. Our purpose is to critically examine this perennial financial reporting controversary, in the context of the three conceptions of accounting: accounting as technical practice, social practice and moral practice as articulated in the definition of accounting proposed by Carnegie et al. (2021a, 2021b) for discussion, debate and potential adoption in the accounting profession, including by accounting standard setters in all sectors. This article is intended to challenge accounting to enhanced self-awareness in reaching its full potential."
"Blockchain and information integration: Applications in New Zealand’s prefabrication supply chain Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things New Zealandâ€™s rising demand for new and affordable homes is driving innovative and effective methods for project delivery. Prefabrication or off-site construction is considered an innovative approach to project delivery that eliminates the limitations of traditional construction methods. However, the prefabrication industry struggles with several challenges, including poor coordination and low supply chain integration amongst its partner organisations. There has been previous literature on improving the prefabrication supply chain integration, but few studies about the role of technology in this sector. Therefore, this article provides intuitions into the applicability and benefits of advanced technologies, namely blockchain, for improving supply chain integration in the context of prefabrication in New Zealand. A questionnaire survey was used to identify the channels used for information exchange between clients and contractors. Moreover, the questionnaire ascertained the positive effects of blockchain on enhancing supply chain integration between the two partners. Blockchain has proven to be a secure information integration instrument that can improve the integration of the prefabrication supply chain by fostering collaboration between organisations."
"Laser and ozone applications for circularity journey in denim manufacturing - A developing country perspective Polymers; Denim Fabric; CR 39 Denim is recognized across the globe for its vintage worn out effect, rough, and tough look along with comfort. Its market share is growing tremendously due to its popularity in all segments of consumers. Despite several advantages, denim manufacturing negatively impacts the environment as it is associated with the use of large amount of water, energy, chemicals, and emission of greenhouse gases. This paper highlights the potential of digital laser technology and waterless ozone technology to promote sustainable chemistry by reducing environmental pollution in denim manufacturing. Using the extant literature and collecting data from two different companies, this paper highlights the sustainable technologies in denim chemical processing and their significance in circular fashion (CF). It was found that the use of digital laser technology in denim patterning, color fading, and surface engraving reduced energy and water consumption; saved a significant amount of chemicals; and prevented effluents from getting discharged to the water bodies. Similarly, the application of ozone in denim washing and color fading helped to resolve the above-mentioned issues in denim manufacturing. The findings from two Vietnamese fashion companies showed that using laser and ozone technologies not only help to achieve sustainability but also lead toward fashion circularity."
"Analysis of pathogenic bacterial and yeast biofilms using the combination of synchrotron ATR-FTIR microspectroscopy and chemometric approaches Staphylococcus Epidermidis; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Polysaccharide Intercellular Adhesin Biofilms are assemblages of microbial cells, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and other components extracted from the environment in which they develop. Within biofilms, the spatial distribution of these components can vary. Here we present a fundamental characterization study to show differences between biofilms formed by Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the yeast-type Candida albicans using synchrotron macro attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) micro-spectroscopy. We were able to characterise the pathogenic biofilmsâ€™ heterogeneous distribution, which is challenging to do using traditional techniques. Multivariate analyses revealed that the polysaccharides area (1200â€“950 cmâˆ’1) accounted for the most significant variance between biofilm sam-ples, and other spectral regions corresponding to amides, lipids, and polysaccharides all contrib-uted to sample variation. In general, this study will advance our understanding of microbial bio-films and serve as a model for future research on how to use synchrotron source ATR-FTIR micro-spectroscopy to analyse their variations and spatial arrangements."
"Image-Based Sexual Abuse: An Australian Reflection Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica Digital technologies are increasingly being used to abuse, harass, and victimize women. Image-based sexual abuse (IBSA)â€”the nonconsensual taking or sharing (including threats to share) nude or sexual imagesâ€”is one such form of abuse. Various jurisdictions have enacted laws criminalizing IBSA, but Australia is arguably leading the way, with eight of its nine jurisdictions introducing innovative IBSA laws. This article explores the Australian laws, focusing on their capacity to address the gendered nature of IBSA. While highlighting the importance of these laws, we argue that a multifaceted approach is required to combat IBSA that includes law reform, education, and training."
"Molecular identification and characterization of probiotic bacillus species with the ability to control vibrio spp. In wild fish intestines and sponges from the vietnam sea Microorganisms; Probiotic Agent; Fingerlings Vibriosis in farmed animals is a serious threat to aquaculture worldwide. Using probiotics and anti-Vibrio antimicrobial substances in aquaculture systems can be a means of preventing Vibrio infections. Therefore, we aimed to characterize and compare 16 potential anti-Vibrio probiotics (Vi+) isolated from marine sponges and fish intestines collected from the Vietnam Sea, as well as an anti-Vibrio bacteriocin to fully explore their application potentials. 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed all Vi+ to be Bacillus species with different strain variants across two sample types. An obvious antimicrobial spectrum toward Gram-negative bacteria was observed from intestinal Vi+ compared to sponge-associated Vi+. The reason was the higher gene frequency of two antimicrobial compounds, non-ribosomal peptides (NRPS) and polyketide type-I (PKS-I) from intestinal Vi+ (66.7%) than sponge-associated Vi+ (14.3% and 0%, respectively). Additionally, a three-step procedure was performed to purify an anti-Vibrio bacteriocin produced by B. methylotrophicus NTBD1, including (i) solvent extraction of bacteriocin from cells, (ii) hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and (iii) reverse-phase HPLC. The bacteriocin had a molecular weight of ~2â€“5 kDa, was sensitive to proteolysis and thermally stable, and showed a broad antimicrobial spectrum, all of which are essential properties for promising feed additives. This study provides necessary information of the potential of probiotic Bacillus species with anti-Vibrio antimicrobial properties to study their further use in sustainable aquaculture."
"Exploring tripartite praxis for the REDD + forest climate change initiative through community based ecotourism Destination; Ecotourism; Destination Management Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is a United Nations programme initiated in 2008 with the aim of mitigating climate change through the preservation of the worldâ€™s existing forest stocks. One of the challenges in its successful implementation has been community involvement in its design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The purpose of this study is to assess what REDD + can learn from the experience of Community-Based Ecotourism (CBET), which operates under many of the same conditions. A critical review of the related literature using the Scopus database was undertaken using three search strings including â€œREDD+â€ (2,913 listings), â€œcommunity-based ecotourismâ€ (113 listings) and â€œREDD + and tourismâ€ (6 listings) to identify the variables and themes related to each. Despite the significant increase in the number of publications on REDD + since 2008, only one was specifically related to ecotourism. We argue that CBET understood as a form of social capital can function as an enabling platform for REDD+, in particular its implementation of international conservation policy by working with local communities/indigenous peoples and business stakeholders, referred to here as the â€œtripartite praxisâ€. We demonstrate how CBET can act as a basis from which to guide internationally driven incentive-based conservation policy and community entrepreneurship within a social capital framework."
"Review on research on concrete beam reinforced with HB-FRP Strengthening; Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics; Debonding To summarize the research results of hybrid bonding fibre reinforced plastic (HB-FRP) reinforcement method and promote its broader application in the field of concrete beam repair and reinforcement, the research status of HB-FRP reinforcement method was investigated. The debonding problem of external bonding FRP under external loads and environmental erosion was revealed. The working mechanism of HB-FRP reinforcement in inhibiting debonding after FRP reinforcement was explained. The structural characteristics of HB-FRP reinforcement system and its influence on the interface bonding performance were analyzed. Existing bonding-slip and debonding load models were summarized. The flexural and shear performance of reinforced beam was studied. The shortcomings of existing studies were analyzed, and future research directions and ideas were prospected. Analysis result shows that both external loads and environmental erosion may induce the debonding of FRP. HB-FRP reinforcement combines the chemical bonding, friction and dowel effect to inhibit the FRP debonding effectively. The main difference among several current HB-FRP bond-slip relationships is whether a stable FRP slip occurs when the interfacial bonding strength is reached. The limit debonding load of the bonding interface depends on its bond-slip relationship. HB-FRP reinforcement can be used for the flexural resistance of normal section and the shear resistance of oblique section, and the bearing capacity and reinforcement efficiency of reinforced beam improve significantly. Increasing the FRP amount and the number of steel fasteners can effectively improve the flexural resistance of reinforced beam. The influence of steel fastener spacing on the bearing capacity of reinforced beam and the reinforcement design criteria are still unclear. The crack and external load have significant effects on the debonding load, material utilization rate, and failure mode of reinforced beam. The increase in the shear strength of reinforced beam mainly generated by the shear forces provided by the FRP and concrete, whereas the influence of stirrup is minimal. The increase in the FRP reinforcement amount and the decrease in the strip spacing can significantly improve the shear capacity of reinforced beam. Follow-up studies on the HB-FRP reinforcement design theory should be continued to propose calculation models for bonding characteristics considering the material and structural characteristics and develop a design method for HB-FRP steel fastener spacing based on the interfacial shear force. Furthermore, the optimized flexure and shear resistance design methods and design formulas for HB-FRP reinforced concrete beams should be developed. 2 tabs, 9 figs, 68 refs."
"The thermal resistivity of concrete façade elements containing novel recycled plastic void formers: An experimental and numerical investigation Rubber Waste; Mechanical Properties; Tires Disposal of post-consumer or post-industrial plastic waste poses a significant challenge due to its non-biodegradable properties, large volume of production, and low recycling rate. Governments worldwide are investing heavily to responsibly process plastic waste. The construction industry is a major sector with the potential to utilise a significant amount of recycled plastic. A combined experimental and modelling study is presented to determine the thermal response of concrete faÃ§ades manufactured using a novel recycled plastic void former (ROBOVOID, patent pending). Multiple faÃ§ade designs that incorporate the ROBOVOID void former are assessed to quantify the apparent thermal resistivity (R-value) of the faÃ§ade element. Apparent thermal resistivity values between 0.3 and 3 K m2/W were experimentally measured. The experimental data were used to validate a numerical model that can predict the thermal response of the faÃ§ade elements. The analysis reveals that faÃ§ades using the ROBOVOID void former can be readily manufactured to attain apparent thermal resistivity values between 1 and 5.5 K m2/W which are suitable to meet or exceed most potential faÃ§ade design requirements as per ISO 6946."
"Freshwater chronic ammonia toxicity: A tropical-to-temperate comparison Ceriodaphnia Dubia; Conductivity; Appalachian Region The chronic toxicity of ammonia to tropical freshwater species is understudied, and thus data on temperate species have been used to derive water quality guideline values for tropical regions. Such practices may lead to underprotective guideline values due to differences in toxicities observed between tropical and temperate species. In addition, the presence of ammonia in low-ionic-strength waters may also result in higher toxicity, and studies on this factor are limited. The present study assessed the toxicity of ammonia to 6 tropical freshwater species in low-ionic-strength waters. Because ammonia toxicity varies depending on the pH and temperature, test water pH concentrations were maintained at approximately pH 6.0 Â± 0.3 at temperatures between 27.5 and 30 Â°C. Low-effect chronic inhibition concentrations were derived for the following species: Chlorella sp. 66 mg L âˆ’1 ; Lemna aequinoctialis 22 mg L âˆ’1 ; Hydra viridissima 1.8 mg L âˆ’1 ; Moinodaphnia macleayi 27 mg L âˆ’1 ; Amerianna cumingi 17 mg L âˆ’1 ; and Mogurnda mogurnda 5.4 mg L âˆ’1 total ammonia nitrogen. Two of the species tested (a cnidarian and a fish species) were among the most sensitive reported anywhere within their taxonomic group. Chronic ammonia datasets representing toxicity estimates for temperate and tropical species were plotted and compared using species sensitivity distributions. The results indicate that the differences in chronic toxicity observed between tropical and temperate species were likely due to the low ionic strength of the waters to which tropical species were exposed, rather than any inherent physiological differences between species from tropical and temperate regions. This finding suggests that tropical waters of low ionic strength may be at a higher risk from ammonia compared with other freshwater ecosystems. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:177â€“189.

"Graduate work-readiness challenges in the Asia-Pacific region and the role of HRM Employability; Competency; Soft Skills Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on graduate work-readiness challenges in three Asia Pacific economies (Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia), and the roles of three main stakeholders (government, employers and industry) in the process. The intention of the paper is to design a stakeholderoriented HRM model to address the identified graduate work-readiness challenges. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative triangulation method comprising interviews and focus groups was used with participant samples for each country - Australia (19), Indonesia (19) and Malaysia (15). Stakeholder-oriented HRM theory underpins the conceptual framework for the paper. Findings - All three countries are currently experiencing difficulties attracting graduates with the required portfolio of qualifications, skills and personal capabilities. The reported effects include: constraints on national economic growth, future production structures, and long-term socio-economic development. Based on a review of the work-readiness and stakeholder-oriented HRM theory literature, it is posited that graduate work-readiness challenges can be effectively addressed by HR professionals in partnership with other key stakeholders. Research limitations/implications - The study sought the input of only three stakeholder groups for ascertaining graduate work readiness challenges, there is a strong case to include other groups including students/parents and secondary schools. Social implications - Bridging the graduate skills gap between government, employers and educational institutions is an important area in which HR professionals can contribute by reducing the mismatch between demand and supply through influencing and balancing the interests and goals of key stakeholders. Originality/value - This study makes a contribution to the extant literature as it explores the role of HR professionals in relation to a multiple stakeholder strategy to address these challenges in the less-explored Asia Pacific region."
"Work like a girl: Redressing gender inequity in academia through systemic solutions Research Personnel; Research Productivity; Women in Science Historically, the professional structure of higher education has provided restricted employment, career, and leadership opportunities for women. This is exacerbated where there is an intersection between gender and race, culture, religion, or age. Women continue to be underrepresented in senior leadership positions across a range of disciplines, and this lack of representation of women within the professional structure of higher education itself acts as a barrier for more women reaching senior levels within institutions. More women are needed in higher positions to increase representation and visibility, and to encourage and mentor others to then aspire to follow a similar path. This critical review examines gender equity across the major career benchmarks of the academy in light of the impact of the personal contexts of women, systemic processes, and cultural barriers that hinder career progression. Research-based systemic solutions that work towards improved gender equity for women are discussed. The findings from this critical review highlight the need for global systemic change in higher education to create ethical equities in the employment, career, and leadership opportunities for women."
"Ultrasonic Processing of Food Waste to Generate Value-Added Products Activated Sludge; Anaerobic Digestion; Pretreatment Ultrasonic processing has a great potential to transform waste from the food and agriculture industry into value-added products. In this review article, we discuss the use of ultrasound for the valorisation of food and agricultural waste. Ultrasonic processing is considered a green technology as compared to the conventional chemical extraction/processing methods. The influence of ultrasound pre-treatment on the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), particle size, and cell wall content of food waste is first discussed. The use of ultrasonic processing to produce/extract bioactives such as oil, polyphenolic, polysaccharides, fatty acids, organic acids, protein, lipids, and enzymes is highlighted. Moreover, ultrasonic processing in bioenergy production from food waste such as green methane, hydrogen, biodiesel, and ethanol through anaerobic digestion is also reviewed. The conversion of waste oils into biofuels with the use of ultrasound is presented. The latest developments and future prospective on the use of ultrasound in developing energy-efficient methods to convert food and agricultural waste into value-added products are summarised."
"Ageing and Declining Rates of Home Ownership: Twin Threats to Housing Assistance Home Ownership; Housing Wealth; Real Estate Market This paper combines forecasts of Australiaâ€™s population with microsimulation and tenure choice models to generate estimates of housing assistance demand from older Australians in 2031. Our projections suggest that singles retreat from home ownership, while rental tenures become increasingly feminised by 2031 as they turn into the tenures of (constrained) choice for a growing proportion of singles and sole parents. Even if home ownership declines by a modest 5 percentage points, real government expenditure on Commonwealth Rent Assistance for Australians aged 55 years and over in 2031 is projected to be more than three times its level in 2011."
"Are measures derived from land use and transport policies associated with walking for transport? Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Background: There is growing urgency for higher quality evidence to inform policy. This study developed geographic information system spatial measures based on land use and transport policies currently used in selected Australian states to assess which, if any, of these measures were associated with walking for transport. Methods: Overall, 6901 participants from 570 neighborhoods in Brisbane Australia, were included. Participants reported their minutes of walking for transport in the previous week. After a review of state-level land use and transport policies relevant to walking for transport across Australia, 7 geographic information system measures were developed and tested based on 9 relevant policies. Data were analyzed using multilevel multinomial logistic regression. Results: Greater levels of walking for transport were associated with more highly connected street networks, the presence of public transport stops, and having at least 2 public transport services per hour. Conversely, neighborhoods with shorter cul-de-sac lengths had lower levels of walking for transport. There was no evidence of associations between walking for transport and street block lengths less than 240 m or traffic volumes. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for urban design and transport policies developed by governments to be assessed for their impact on transport-related physical activity."
"Potential of Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis salina for nutrient and organic matter removal from municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Municipal wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) poses health and environmental risks on its disposal as it contains nutrients and harmful organic compounds at elevated concentrations. This study compared a freshwater microalga Chlorella vulgaris and a marine microalga Nannochloropsis salina in suspended and alginate-immobilised cultures for batch and semi-continuous treatment of the ROC. The immobilised algae gave comparable nutrient removal rates to the suspended cells, demonstrating immobilisation had no apparent negative impact on the photosynthetic activity of microalgae. Semi-continuous algal treatment illustrated that the microalgae could remove significant amounts of nutrients (> 50% and > 80% for TN and TP, respectively), predominantly through algal uptake (> 90%), within a short period (48 h) and generate 335â€“360 mg DCW L-1 d-1 of algal biomass. The treatment also removed a significant amount of organic matter (12.7â€“13.3 mg DOC L-1 d-1), primarily (> 65%) through the biotic pathway."
"Sewage sludge biochar alters root colonization of mycorrhizal fungi in a soil cultivated with corn Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Sewage sludge biochar (SSB) has demonstrated a large potential to improve soil quality, availability of nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P), and increase crop productivity. There is a lack of information on the effect of P from SSB on the soil microbiota, especially on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Six treatments were arranged in randomized blocks, with four replicates: 1) Control - without any amendments; 2) Mineral fertilization with NPK; 3) Biochar prepared at 300 Â°C (BC300); 4) Biochar prepared at 500 Â°C (BC500); 5) BC300 + NPK; 6) BC500 + NPK. Amendments were applied in two consecutive harvests. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), percentage of mycorrhizal colonization (MC) and easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein (EEG) of soil mycorrhizal fungi were evaluated in all treatments. Amendment with BC300 resulted in an increase in MBC, while all treatments resulted in an increase in the colonization of corn roots by AMF. Consequently, SSB stimulated the synthesis and excretion of EEG from the soil. Biochar, NPK mineral fertilizer and their combinations increased MC in corn compared to the control. However, no additive effects of SSB and NPK addition were observed."
"A method for separation of heavy metal sources in urban groundwater using multiple lines of evidence Brownfield Redevelopment; Brownfields; Contaminated Land Determining sources of heavy metals in soils, sediments and groundwater is important for understanding their fate and transport and mitigating human and environmental exposures. Artificially imported fill, natural sediments and groundwater from 240 ha of reclaimed land at Fishermans Bend in Australia, were analysed for heavy metals and other parameters to determine the relative contributions from different possible sources. Fishermans Bend is Australia's largest urban re-development project, however, complicated land-use history, geology, and multiple contamination sources pose challenges to successful re-development. We developed a method for heavy metal source separation in groundwater using statistical categorisation of the data, analysis of soil leaching values and fill/sediment XRF profiling. The method identified two major sources of heavy metals in groundwater: 1. Point sources from local or up-gradient groundwater contaminated by industrial activities and/or legacy landfills; and 2. contaminated fill, where leaching of Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn was observed. Across the precinct, metals were most commonly sourced from a combination of these sources; however, eight locations indicated at least one metal sourced solely from fill leaching, and 23 locations indicated at least one metal sourced solely from impacted groundwater. Concentrations of heavy metals in groundwater ranged from 0.0001 to 0.003 mg/L (Cd), 0.001â€“0.1 mg/L (Cr), 0.001â€“0.2 mg/L (Cu), 0.001â€“0.5 mg/L (Ni), 0.001â€“0.01 mg/L (Pb), and 0.005â€“1.2 mg/L (Zn). Our method can determine the likely contribution of different metal sources to groundwater, helping inform more detailed contamination assessments and precinct-wide management and remediation strategies. A method for heavy metal source separation in groundwater has been developed for use in large-scale urban re-development settings, to inform contamination assessments, and remediation strategies."
"Content analysis of responses to The Line, an Australian primary prevention of violence against women campaign on Facebook Sexual Assault; Bystander; Crime Victims Issue addressed: Primary prevention of violence against women (PVAW) strategies and campaigns aim to address and challenge violence-supportive behaviour and normative social structures to intervene before violence happens. Towards this aim, from 2014 to 2019, The Line was a public Australian Commonwealth-supported PVAW campaign on social media that targeted young people. This study explores how young people discussed PVAW-related themes on the campaign's Facebook page. Methods: Social media scraping tools were used to collect 346 941 comments on The Line's Facebook page from 2014 to 2017. In this study, 3663 comments included three high frequency, PVAW-related key terms, â€˜violenceâ€™ (1430 comments), â€˜genderâ€™ (1602 comments) and â€˜consentâ€™ (631 comments). These were identified and were thematically coded. Results: Young people's comments indicated high support for violence prevention but varied in how they understood gendered violence and factors that contribute to it, and instead, some argued that the campaign should not ignore men. Some young people who engaged with The Line on a long-term basis and spoke to its aims, proposed interpretations from their experiences, and challenged the campaign to progress. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that young people influence each other by adopting and disrupting PVAW knowledge in a publicly funded social media campaign. So what?: Public PVAW social media campaigns can encourage young people to discuss gendered violence online. However, successful campaigns need ongoing support to develop conversations with target populations that allow diverse audiences to build their knowledge."
"Systematic planning can rapidly close the protection gap in Australian mammal havens Dingoes; Mammals; Vulpes Vulpes In the last 30 years, islands and fenced exclosures free of introduced predators (collectively, havens) have become an increasingly used option for protecting Australian mammals imperiled by predation by introduced cats (Felis catus) and foxes (Vulpes vulpes). However, Australia's network of havens is not expanding in a manner that maximizes representation of all predator-susceptible taxa, because of continued emphasis on already-represented taxa. Future additions to the haven network will improve representation of mammals most efficiently if they fill gaps in under-represented predator-susceptible taxa, particularly rodents. A systematic approach to expansion could protect at least one population of every Australian predator-susceptible threatened mammal taxon by the addition of 12 new havens to the current network. Were the current haven network to be doubled in number in a systematic manner, it could protect three populations of every Australian predator-susceptible threatened mammal taxon."
"In-Silico Analysis and Antidiabetic Effect of α-Amylase and α-Glucosidase Inhibitory Peptides from Lupin Protein Hydrolysate: Enzyme-Peptide Interaction Study Using Molecular Docking Approach Bioactivity; Protein Hydrolysates; Antihypertensive Effect The use of natural ingredients for managing diabetes is becoming more popular in recent times due to the several adverse effects associated with synthetic antidiabetic medications. In this study, we investigated the in vitro antidiabetic potential (through inhibition of Î±-glucosidase (AG) and Î±-amylase (AA)) of hydrolysates from lupin proteins pretreated with ultrasound and hydrolyzed using alcalase (ACT) and flavourzyme (FCT). We further fractionated ACT and FCT into three molecular weight fractions. Unfractionated ACT and FCT showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher AG (IC50 value = 1.65 mg/mL and 1.91 mg/mL) and AA (IC50 value = 1.66 mg/mL and 1.98 mg/mL) inhibitory activities than their ultrafiltrated fractions, where lower IC50 values indicate higher inhibitory activities. Then, ACT and FCT were subjected to peptide sequencing using LC-MS-QTOF to identify the potential AG and AA inhibitors. Molecular docking was performed on peptides with the highest number of hotspots and PeptideRanker score to study their interactions with AG and AA enzymes. Among the peptides identified, SPRRF, FE, and RR were predicted to be the most active peptides against AG, while AA inhibitors were predicted to be RPR, PPGIP, and LRP. Overall, hydrolysates prepared from lupin proteins using alcalase and flavourzyme may be useful in formulating functional food for managing diabetics."

"Assessing ecosystem resilience to a tropical cyclone based on ecosystem service supply proficiency using geospatial techniques and social responses in coastal Bangladesh Cultural Ecosystem Services; China; Natural Capital Ecosystem services are essential for the livelihoods of marginalized communities; however, their supply can be severely disturbed when natural hazards impact on low-lying coastal regions. To understand potential disaster impacts on sustainable livelihoods, ecosystem resilience needs to be assessed before and after a disaster. We examined ecosystem resilience to a tropical cyclone in a southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh in terms of its impacts on the ecosystem's service supply proficiency (ESSP). We adopted a two-tiered methodology commencing with landcover mapping using object-based image analysis (OBIA) to identify five distinct landcovers (cropland, mangrove forest, riparian forest, tidal flat, and sandy beach). Then, Likert scores were used to reflect human perceptions of the supply proficiency of three types of ecosystem services (provisioning, regulating, and cultural services) associated with each landcover. The resilience of each landcover type was assessed by integrating maps of damage and recovery with the Likert scores to calculate ESSP scores. A substantial post-cyclone reduction in ESSP scores was revealed. Significant recovery (both short- and long-term) was observed in most of the affected ecosystems, albeit at somewhat different rates for different ecosystems. This study provides a multi-faceted evaluation of cyclone impacts on existing ecosystems and insight into ecosystem behaviour at different temporal phases of a disaster event. Accordingly, the study offers a novel way to study ecosystem resilience to support effective coastal planning within a vulnerable coastal community."
"The toxicity and valorization options of cigarette butts Tobacco; Smoking; Leachates Cigarette butts, one of the most abundant forms of waste in the world, contain more than 4000 toxic chemicals and pose serious risks to the health of wildlife, humans, and marine and freshwater organisms. Although trivial in size, trillions of cigarettes are produced every year worldwide, resulting in the accumulation of tonnes of toxic waste litter. In 2016, a world production of over 5.7 trillion cigarettes was reported with the majority comprising cellulose acetate filters â€“ a polymer with poor biodegradability. Depending on the environmental conditions, cellulose acetate filters can take up to 10 years to decompose during which time they leach heavy metals and toxic chemicals into the environment. Although possible disposal methods for collected cigarette butt waste include incineration and landfilling, both techniques may result in the release of hazardous fumes and can be costly. However, recycling CBs in different materials could be a possible solution for this concurrent environmental pollution. A number of novel studies have been publicized on recycling cigarette butts with encouraging results, and several methods have been studied, including recycling of cigarette butts in asphalt concrete and fired clay bricks, as a carbon source, sound absorbing material, corrosion inhibitor, biofilm carrier, and many more. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive review and discussion of various studies that have been carried out on the toxicity and valorization of cigarette butt waste and investigates the feasibility and sustainability of recycling methods adopted. Further research and developments are essential for the widespread application of recycling cigarette butts."

"Temporal trends in co-morbidities and cardiometabolic risk factors at the time of type 2 diabetes diagnosis in the UK Blood Glucose; Insulin Resistance; Acanthosis Nigricans Aim: To evaluate temporal patterns in co-morbidities, cardiometabolic risk factors and a high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk population at type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnosis by age groups and sex. Materials and Methods: From the UK primary care database, 248,619 people with a new diagnosis of T2D during 2005â€“2016 were identified. Among people without ASCVD, high ASCVD risk was defined as two or more of current smoker, grade 2+ obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia or microvascular disease. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) was defined as two or more of cardiovascular disease, microvascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, grade 2+ obesity or cancer. Temporal patterns in the distribution of cardiometabolic risk factors were evaluated. Results: While the prevalence of ASCVD was stable over time (approximately 18%), 50% were identified to have a high ASCVD risk (26% and 38% in the 18â€“39 and 40â€“49 years age groups, respectively), with an increasing trend across all age groups. Overall, 51% had CMM at diagnosis, increasing during 2005â€“2016 for the 18â€“39 years age group by 14%â€“17%, for the 40â€“49 years age group by 27%â€“33%, for the 50â€“59 years age group by 41%â€“50%, for the 60â€“69 years age group by 56%â€“65%, and for the 70â€“79 years age group by 65%â€“80%. People with young-onset T2D had significantly higher HbA1c, body mass index and lipids at diagnosis (all p <.01). The proportions with an HbA1c of 7.5% or higher in the 18â€“39 and 40â€“49 years age groups were 58% and 54%, respectively, significantly and consistently higher over the last decade compared with those aged 50 years or older, with males having higher proportions of 15â€“26 and 10â€“18 percentage points, respectively, compared with females. Conclusions: CMM and high ASCVD risk have been increasing consistently across all age groups and in both sex, in particular CMM in those aged younger than 50 years. Our findings indicate that the European Society of Cardiologyâ€“European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommendations need to change to consider people with young-onset T2D as a high-risk group, as recommended in the Primary Care Diabetes Europe position statement."

"Sustainable management of groundwater extraction: An Australian perspective on current challenges Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Study region: Australia Study focus: Our incomplete knowledge of groundwater systems and processes imposes barriers in attempting to manage groundwater sustainably. Challenges also arise through complex institutional arrangements and decision-making processes, and the difficulty in involving stakeholders. In some areas, these difficulties have led to water table decline and impacts on groundwater users and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. However, there is potential to improve the sustainable use of groundwater resources through improvements in management practices. We discuss some of the challenges, and present survey results of research, government, and industry professionals across the groundwater sector in Australia. New hydrological insights for the region: The highest-ranked challenge identified in the survey was the difficulty in determining regional-scale volumetric water extraction limits. This is surprising given the criticism in the international literature of volumetric based approaches for groundwater management, and the decreased reliance on this approach in Australia and elsewhere in recent years. Other major challenges are the difficulty in determining and implementing maximum drawdown criteria for groundwater levels, determining water needs of ecosystems, and managing groundwater impacts on surface water. Notwithstanding these gaps in technical understanding and tools and a lack of resources for groundwater studies, improvements in stakeholder communication should enable more effective decision-making and improve compliance with regulations designed to protect groundwater and dependent ecosystems."
"Two hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms for a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain network design problem in the tire industry under uncertainty Closed-Loop Supply Chain; Remanufacturing; Reverse Logistics There is so much interest in online purchasing within supply chain networks nowadays. After expanding the internet access and services, customersâ€™ behavior has changed. Today, a customer's shopping manner usually begins with the internet search. With this approach, we face some new trends in this field, such as online-to-offline (O2O) commerce that aims to balance online and offline sales. Regarding the supply chain management, the O2O commerce can help the managers to conduct both online and offline businesses. The tire industry is one of the applications of the O2O approach, which also directly affects the supply chain network design (SCND). Therefore, this work for the first time proposes a dual-channel, multi-product, multi-period, multi-echelon closed-loop SCND under uncertainty for the tire industry. To tackle the uncertain parameters of the problem (e.g., prices and demand), a fuzzy approach, so-called the Jimenez's method, is applied. Another main innovation of this work is two new hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms with new procedures. Two recent nature-inspired algorithms (i.e., red deer algorithm (RDA) and whale optimization algorithm (WOA)) are hybridized with the genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) to strengthen the diversification and intensification phases, respectively. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the hybrid version of WOA and SA returns high-quality solutions and requires an acceptable amount of computational time. The conducted sensitivity analyses underline the importance of tire remanufacturing. Furthermore, setting the appropriate prices in different channels for the available tire types is critical for sustainable tire supply chain management."
"Attitudinal support for violence against women: What a population-level survey of the Australian community can and cannot tell us Intimate Partner Violence; Violence Against Women; Domestic Violence Violence against women (VAW) is a serious and prevalent problem globally. Societal-level norms, practices and structures are among the factors contributing to it, sometimes referred to collectively as representing â€œcultures of supportâ€ for VAW. Understanding factors contributing to these cultures is important for prevention, but remains the subject of debate. Population-level surveys of attitudes toward VAW are one means to strengthen this understanding. Although there are a number of such surveys internationally, scholarly research based on secondary analysis of data, at least from surveys in high-income countries, is scant. This article reports on new analyses of the Australian National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women survey to explore its potential to further empirical and conceptual understanding of cultures of support for VAW. To facilitate this, a scale to measure attitudes toward VAW was developed post hoc from the survey (the Violence Supportive Attitudes, or VSA-18, Scale). Subsequent analyses investigate the relationship between this scale and relevant demographic factors and a measure of attitudinal support for gender equality (GE). The GE measure, place of birth, employment and occupation, generation, education and sex contribute to variance in the VSA-18 Scale. Findings are discussed in the context of theoretical debates and directions for future research."
"Factors affecting the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices: Findings from panel data for Vietnam Agriculture; Indo-Gangetic Plain; Tillage Conventional farming and climate change are placing considerable stress on agricultural systems around the world, leading to increased hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, particularly in developing countries. Sustainable Agricultural Practices (SAPs) can help raise productivity and agricultural incomes while minimising negative environmental impacts. While recognising that sustainability is a contested term, we identify agricultural practices that are generally viewed as sustainable as they minimise impacts on the environment. Despite the benefits of SAPs, adoption rates are still low in developing countries. While previous studies have examined the factors affecting SAP adoption, most have not accounted for issues of heterogeneity and endogeneity inherent in such analysis. In this paper, we address this by employing a random-effects probit model with the Mundlak approach and fixed-effects linear probability models to control for farmer- and plot-level heterogeneities and to avoid the incidental parameters problem. We analyse panel data from Vietnam for approximately 14,000 plots over the period 2008â€“2016 to identify the factors behind SAP adoption. Overall, we find that improved knowledge transferred by extension agents and learning from peers significantly influence adoption. Farmers' knowledge of their land and soil quality are also important factors. We recommend enhancing cooperation between extension agents, farmer groups and peers in order to encourage SAP adoption."
"Leaf my neighbourhood alone! predicting the influence of densification on residential tree canopy cover in Perth Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Trees provide myriad ecosystem services of benefit to urban populations; however, urban development is pressuring existing urban tree coverage. Thus, a pertinent challenge for planners is identifying development scenarios that find synergies between urban growth and the preservation or enhancement of tree canopy coverage. This paper presents the training and validation of a model that predicts changes in neighbourhood-level urban tree canopy cover associated with different socio-economic and physical urban form variables. Neighbourhoods across Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, were used as a case study. A Random Forests model was trained using a suite of socio-economic and urban form variables and neighbourhood percentage tree canopy cover derived from very high resolution multispectral remote sensing images and digital surface models. This model was validated using independent test data with a mean absolute error of 1.78% and a root mean square error of 2.42%. An application of this model was demonstrated using the City of Nedlands, Perth, where a new planning scheme allowing denser urban development has been approved by the State Government. The magnitude and spatial variation in the change of neighbourhood tree canopy cover in the City of Nedlands in 2050 associated with three urban development scenarios was predicted using the model."
"Rate of fatty acid transport in glassy biopolymers: A free volume based predictive approach Vitrification; Water; Maltodextrins Metastable properties of biopolymer networks affect significantly the diffusion kinetics of bioactive compounds. That was shown to be the case in high solid samples of protein and polysaccharide supporting a homogeneous distribution of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thermomechanical behaviour of these matrices was characterised in relation to their glass transition temperature (Tg). A free volume theory of diffusion was considered to treat transport phenomena of fatty acids within glassy polymers. It was found that at T > Tg the effective diffusion coefficient of microconstituent transport would increase in accordance with the free volume of the polymer matrix. Fitting experimental diffusivity data in glassy polymers to a free volume based theory generates a two-parameter equation that calculates the extent of molecular interaction between macromolecule and microconstituent. Gradual substitution of polymer with small-molecule co-solute, glucose syrup in this case, induces a plasticising effect that profoundly affects the level of interaction, hence the diffusion of fatty acids in the condensed biomaterial."
"A combination model based on transfer learning for waste classification Object Detection; Deep Learning; IOU The increasing amount of solid waste is becoming a significant problem that needs to be addressed urgently. The reliable and accurate classification method is a crucial step in waste disposal because different types of wastes have different disposal ways. The existing waste classification models driven by deep learning are not easy to achieve accurate results and still need to be improved due to the various architecture networks adopted. Their performance on different datasets is varied, and there is also a lack of specific large-scale datasets for training. We propose a new combination classification model based on three pretrained CNN models (VGG19, DenseNet169, and NASNetLarge) for processing the ImageNet database and achieve high classification accuracy. In our proposed model, the transfer learning model based on each pretrained model is constructed as a candidate classifier, and the optimal output of three candidate classifiers is selected as the final classification result. The experiments based on two waste image datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves 96.5% and 94% classification accuracy and outperforms several counterpart methods."
"The Adoption Appraisal of Autonomous Vehicles Robot; Random Trees; Artificial Potential Field This paper presents an application of the multi-attribute decision making (MADM) methodology, intended to determine the levels of the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AV). We have used results of the survey conducted in Saudi Arabia as inputs for MADM. Our approach is based on fuzzy logic, and it incorporates criteria identified by survey responses that influence degree of the new technology acceptance. These criteria are related to the positive outcomes, like reduction of air pollution, environmental sustainability, efficiency and effectiveness of new transport systems and negative issues like high cost and associated risks of the automation. The survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia, where a new futuristic, smart, megacity is being launched. It will be powered by renewable energy with zero emission. We aim to establish if the community, businesses and government are ready to adopt new autonomous driving technology. The model can be used in various applications reliant on multi-attribute constraints, envisioned to obtain a resolution that satisfies all restraints. Results attained by using this methodology and survey were updated considering COVID-19 outbreaks, trends and known impacts on this adoption which is expected to have."
"Waste-derived low-cost mycelium composite construction materials with improved fire safety Mechanical Properties; Plywood; Fagus Sylvatica Subsp. Orientalis Mycelial growth attracts academic and commercial interest because of its ability to upcycle agricultural and industrial wastes into economical and environmentally sustainable composite materials using a natural, low-energy manufacturing process able to sequester carbon. This study aims to characterise the effect of varying ratios of high silica agricultural and industrial wastes on the flammability of mycelium composites, relative to typical synthetic construction materials. The results reveal that mycelium composites are safer than the traditional construction materials considered, producing much lower average and peak heat release rates and longer time to flashover. They also release significantly less smoke and CO2, although CO production fluctuated. Rice hulls yielded significant char and silica ash which improved fire performance, but composites containing glass fines exhibited the best fire performance because of their significantly higher silica concentrations and low combustible material content. Higher concentrations of glass fines increased volume-specific cost but reduced mass-specific and density-specific costs. The findings of this study show that mycelium composites are a very economical alternative to highly flammable petroleum-derived and natural gas-derived synthetic polymers and engineered woods for applications including insulation, furniture, and panelling."
"Instance space analysis for the car sequencing problem Mixed-Model Assembly Line; Paint Shop; Automobile We investigate an important research question for solving the car sequencing problem, that is, which characteristics make an instance hard to solve? To do so, we carry out an instance space analysis for the car sequencing problem, by extracting a vector of problem features to characterize an instance. In order to visualize the instance space, the feature vectors are projected onto a 2-D space using dimensionality reduction techniques. The resulting 2-D visualizations provide new insights into the characteristics of the instances used for testing and how these characteristics influence the behaviours of an optimization algorithm. This analysis guides us in constructing a new set of benchmark instances with a range of instance properties. We demonstrate that these new instances are more diverse than the previous benchmarks, including some instances that are significantly more difficult to solve. We introduce two new algorithms for solving the car sequencing problem and compare them with four existing methods from the literature. Our new algorithms are shown to perform competitively for this problem but no single algorithm can outperform all others over all instances. This observation motivates us to build an algorithm selection model based on machine learning, to identify the niche in the instance space that an algorithm is expected to perform well on. Our analysis helps to understand problem hardness and select an appropriate algorithm for solving a given car sequencing problem instance."
Old and Appreciated: Exploring the Influence of Material Ageing on the Aesthetic Appreciation of Everyday Products Materials Selection; Multicriteria Decision-making; Decision Making There is a growing interest in design research to explore sustainable consumption via products that are cherished as they age. This paper presents an empirical study exploring the influence of patina (signs of surface aging) on consumers' willingness to discard products and aesthetic appreciation. Results show participants are predisposed to discard everyday products regardless aesthetic qualities (patina). This implies designers should look beyond the presence of pure aesthetic qualities of aging and emphasise symbolic qualities of aging to stimulate appreciation as products age.
"A feasibility study and assessment: Distributed solar system in high-density areas Solar Collectors; Solar; Tilt Solar photovoltaic (PV) energy has emerged as an innovation for greenhouse gas reduction in the building and construction industry due to the calculable advantages it possesses. Although there is evidence supporting the inclusion of small-scale roof-mounted PV systems in detached houses, limited studies have been conducted on the implementation of PV in the commercial sector especially within high-density urban areas. This study conducted a detailed value assessment to optimize the cost of applying PV systems in a high-density city area of Melbourne. The Net Present Value results evidence the feasibility to apply roof-mounted polycrystalline PV products in the case study buildings. This research supports investorsâ€™ decisions by understanding the financial values of prefabricated PV systems in high-density regions and provides suggestions to building professionals on value-for-money design."
"Effects of Tai Chi on the quality of life, mental wellbeing, and physical function of adults with chronic diseases: Protocol for a single-blind, two-armed, randomised controlled trial Mcgill Pain Questionnaire; Reproducibility; Chronic Pain Introduction Quality of life (QoL), mental wellbeing, and physical function are often diminished among people with chronic disease. Tai Chi is a moderate form of exercise that may be effective in improving chronic disease management. This protocol paper outlines a trial to determine the therapeutic effects of a Tai Chi program on chronic disease management. Methods and analysis This study will be a pilot, interventional, single-blind, two-armed, randomised, parallel, and controlled trial involving a 12-week Tai Chi program for Australian adults. Forty people aged 18 years and older, diagnosed with one or more chronic disease from general community will be recruited. All participants will be randomised to either a 12-week Tai Chi program or a waiting list control group. The Tai Chi program will involve 12 weeks of group Tai Chi sessions, with 45 minutes per session, twice a week. The primary outcome will be QoL as measured by mean scores on the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12v2) and the EuroQoL (EQ-5D). The secondary outcomes will include anxiety as measured by mean score on the generalised anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) survey; depression as measured by mean score on the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9); work productivity and activity assessment (WPAI:SHP); pain (if any) as measured by mean scores on the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ). These primary and secondary outcomes will be self-administered via two online assessments prior to (T0) and post-intervention (T1). Objective measures as additional secondary outcomes, will also be carried out by the research team including flexibility as measured by the finger to floor distance (FFD); obesity as measured by mean scores on body mass index (BMI); vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperate, and oxygen saturation) as measured by a blood pressure monitor, tympanic, and pulse oximetry device, and these outcomes will be measured at T0 and T1 in the ECU Holistic Health Research Clinic. People diagnosed with pre-diabetes or diabetes, their glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C) and fasting (before breakfast) blood glucose level (BGL) will also be measured via test kits at T0 and T1 in the clinic. Linear mixed modelling will be conducted to assess changes in outcomes. Statistical significance will be set at an alpha level of 0.05 with a medium effect size. All analyses will be conducted using R version 4.1. Qualitative data will be analysed using template thematic analysis. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Edith Cowan University (ECU) Human Research Ethics Committee (2021-03042-WANG). Research findings will be disseminated to the public, health professionals, researchers, and healthcare providers through conference presentations, lay summaries, and peer-reviewed publications. This study will provide an updated evidence on a safe, sustainable, and inexpensive non-pharmacological approach in the management of chronic disease, the number one burden of disease in Australia."
"Improving energy efficiency of carbon fiber manufacturing through waste heat recovery: A circular economy approach with machine learning Polyacrylonitriles; Wet Spinning; Stabilization There remain major concerns over the increasing use and waste of materials and energy resources in multiple manufacturing sectors. To address these concerns, some manufacturers have begun to align their R&D efforts with the circular economy principles: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Replace (RRRR). Focusing on advanced composites manufacturing sector, this paper presents an innovative approach for process design and analysis of a new waste heat recovery system for carbon fiber manufacturing. Namely, the stabilization process is known to be one of the most critical steps in the production of carbon fibers, as it consumes the most energy, has the largest factory footprint, is a complex system composed of many components, and is the largest capital investment within the factory line. The heat recovery system in this step of the manufacturing can notably reduce energy consumption, emission, cost, and conversion time, while aiming to maintain the mechanical properties of the final product. Here, via an actual industry-scale fibre production setting, the energy consumption factors were obtained and used to model the total energy and its balance in the thermal stabilization step. Two machine learning approaches with limited data, Artificial Neural Network and Non-Linear Regression were then constructed to predict the energy consumption. Results suggested that using the recovery system by means of a heat exchanger, can yield over 62.7 kW recovery, corresponding to 64% of total exhausted energy from the entire process. The electric energy consumption was reduced from 73.3 kW to 10.2 kW, which corresponded to an 86% improvement in the total energy efficiency. The model also confirmed that, by preheating the make-up air with the recovered energy, the energy performance index of the thermal stabilization can be increased from 0.08 to 0.44, along with a reduction in the process carbon footprint by 28.5 t/y. This is especially crucial as we are turning on smart digitalisation in manufacturing inspired by industry 4.0 concept with limited data."
"Toward a Grand Narrative of Bronze Age Vegetation Change and Social Dynamics in the Southern Levant Southern Levant; Early Bronze Age; Jordan We introduce a grand narrative on the development of Levantine Bronze Age civilization by applying digital technology to integrate long-term paleovegetation modeling with regional settlement patterns over the course of two millennia in the mid-Holocene. We consider the implications of shifts in potential vegetation linked with ancient climate change as a means of refreshing archaeological narratives on the causes and consequences of regional social dynamics, especially those related to the rise and collapse of agrarian town-based complex society. This study applies GIS, remote sensing, and statistical modeling tools (MAXENT) to nearly 1700 historical and modern plant species observation points across the southern Levant to create maps of modern and past potential vegetation based on annual precipitation and temperature values generated by a macrophysical climate model. We model the past potential vegetation of the Levant in 100-year intervals between ca. 5500 and 3000 years BP. Modeled ancient environmental dynamics are linked to settlement pattern shifts as they reflect the coalescence and dissolution of aggregated Bronze Age communities and town-based social systems. Junctures of environmental, archaeological, and historical change serve as interpretive touchstones around which grand narratives of the Levantine Bronze Age can be built."
"Government efforts and roadmaps for building information modeling implementation: lessons from Singapore, the UK and the US Information Modeling; Facilities Management; Construction Industry Purpose: The government plays a critical role in driving building information modeling (BIM) implementation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the government efforts for driving BIM implementation in three benchmark countries, namely, Singapore, the UK and the US, so as to develop appropriate roadmaps for increasing BIM implementations in other countries. Design/methodology/approach: This study performs a review on the government efforts and roles in BIM implementation in three benchmark countries, namely, Singapore, the UK and the US. Findings: Through cross comparison with existing literature, it is found that Singapore and the UK adopt a government-driven approach and a phase-by-phase development pattern is observed. The first phase focuses on the building sector to rapidly increase the use of BIM and the government generally plays the role of an initiator. In the second phase, BIM is expanded to other implementation areas, e.g. smart city. The importance of the initiator role decreases and more attention is paid to supporting roles such as researcher, educator and regulator. In contrast, an industry-driven approach is adopted in the US. The main role of the government is that of a regulator, with research institutions actively supporting the BIM implementation. Research limitations/implications: General roadmaps of the two mandating approaches are presented. The results can provide a useful reference for countries and regions that intend to develop roadmaps to increase their BIM maturity level and enhance readiness to accept and implement BIM. Originality/value: This study is one of the first studies that investigate the step-by-step roadmaps for implementing BIM from the perspective of changing government roles."
"Insects in the city: Does remnant native habitat influence insect order distributions? Bombus; Bees; Neonicotinoids There is increasing interest in developing urban design principles that incorporate good ecological management. Research on understanding the distribution and role of beneficial pollinating insects, in particular, is changing our view of the ecological value of cities. With the rapid expansion of the built environment comes a need to understand how insects may be affected in extensive urban areas. We therefore investigated insect pollinator capture rates in a rapidly growing and densely urbanized city (Melbourne, Australia). We identified a remnant native habitat contained within the expansive urban boundary, and established study sites at two nearby populated urban areas. We employed standard pan trap sampling techniques to passively sample insect orders in the different environments. Our results show that, even though the types of taxonomic groups of insects captured are comparable between locations, important pollinators like bees and hoverflies were more frequently captured in the remnant native habitat. By contrast, beetles (Coleoptera) and butterflies/moths (Lepidoptera) were more frequently observed in the urban residential regions. Our results suggest that the maintenance of native habitat zones within cities is likely to be valuable for the conservation of bees and the ecosystem services they provide."
"Recycling Waste Cigarette Butts in Dense Graded Asphalt Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens Trillions of cigarette butts (CBs) are dumped into landfills globally. CBs leach toxic components into the soil, including heavy metals, tar, and many other chemical compounds. Approximately 7.2 billion CBs are discarded every year in Australia, and 16.8 billion CBs accumulate in the waste management system annually. In previous work, the encapsulation method for CB with bitumen and paraffin wax was developed and encapsulated CB in dense graded asphalt (DGA) was evaluated using bitumen classes C320, C170, and C600. In recent studies, the encapsulation method was improved, and the possible use of bitumen-encapsulated CB (BECB) in stone mastic asphalt (SMA) was demonstrated. To build on this foundational research, the current work aimed to investigate the use of improved BECB in heavy-duty DGA prepared with polymer-modified bitumen (PMB) class A10E. Samples were prepared following VicRoads and Austroads guidelines. In this research, the Marshall stability and flow, resilient modulus, dynamic creep, tensile strength ratio, and indirect tension fatigue test were performed to evaluate the performance of BECB-modified DGA. The results were compared with the control DGA prepared with industry-standard conventional materials. Test results suggested that using 0.5% and 1% BECB in DGA met the industry requirements and endorsed the recycling method of CB in asphalt concrete."
"Multicultural skills in open innovation: relational leadership enabling knowledge sourcing and sharing Alliance Portfolios; Firm; Open Innovation Purpose: In this paper, the authors argue that multicultural skills and relational leadership act as enablers for open innovation, and thereby examine the process through which teams can utilize multicultural skills to support the development of relational leadership and knowledge sourcing and sharing (KSS) through individual interaction and relationship building. The authors address the following research question: How does relational leadership enable open innovation (OI) among employees with multicultural skills? Design/methodology/approach: This paper applies a multi-level approach (team and individual level) and builds on interviews with 20 employees, middle and senior managers with multicultural experiences, working in open innovation environments. Findings: The authorsâ€™ findings shed light on the process through which social exchange relationships among team members (e.g. R&D teams) and knowledge exchange partners are enhanced by the use of multicultural skills and support the development of relational leadership to facilitate KSS and ultimately OI. The decision for participants to collaborate and source and share knowledge is motivated by individual reward (such as establishing network or long-lasting contacts), skill acquisition (such as learning or personal growth in decision-making) and a sense of reciprocity and drive for group gain. The authors encourage greater human resource (HR) manager support for relational leadership and the development and use of multicultural skills to promote KSS. Research limitations/implications: Despite the value of our findings, this paper is not without limitations. The authors explained that the focus of this study design was on the work activities of the participants and their skill development and not specific projects or organizations. It was outside the scope of this study to examine variations across organizations and individuals as the authors wanted to focus on multicultural skills and relational leadership as enablers for OI. The authors recommend that future studies extend our research by unpacking how various boundary conditions including relational leadership and multicultural skills impact KSS and OI over the life cycle of innovation teams within large multinational organizations, across countries and ethnicities. Practical implications: The studyâ€™s findings provide managers with improved understandings of how to enable an individual's willingness and readiness to source and share knowledge through multicultural skills and relational leadership. Managers need to ensure that human resource management (HRM) practices celebrate multicultural skills and support relational leadership in innovation teams. The authors suggest managers engaged in OI consider the components of social exchange as described by Meeker (1971) and utilize reciprocity, group gain, rationality and status consistency to support the emergence relational leadership and KSS in innovation teams. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors contribute to the dearth of literature on the boundary conditions for OI by examining the role of relational leadership and characteristics/skills of the workforce, namely multicultural skills and contribute to the scarce research on the role of employees with multicultural skills and their impact on OI and present multicultural skills/experiences and relational leadership as enablers for OI."
"Mitigating spatial conflict of land use for sustainable wetlands landscape in Li-Xia-river region of central Jiangsu, China Ecosystem Health; China; Ecological Civilisation Li-Xia-river Wetlands make up the biggest freshwater marsh in East China. Over the last decades, social and economic developments have dramatically altered the natural wetlands landscape. Mitigating land use conflict is beneficial to protect wetlands, maintain ecosystem services, and coordinate local socioeconomic development. This study employed multi-source data and GIS-based approaches to construct a composite index model with the purpose of quantitatively evaluating the intensity of land use conflict in Li-Xia-river Wetlands from 1978 to 2018. The results showed that the percentage of the wetlandsâ€™ area declined from 20.3% to 15.6%, with an overall reduction rate of 23.2%. The mean index of land use conflict increased from 0.15 to 0.35, which suggests that the conflict intensity changed from â€œno conflictâ€ to â€œmild conflict.â€ The number of severe conflict units increased by about 25 times. A conspicuous spatial variation of land use conflict was observed across different periods, although taking land for agricultural activities was the overriding reason for wetlands reduction. However, in recent years, urban sprawl has posed the greatest threat to Li-Xia-river Wetlands. Coordinating land use conflict and formulating a practical strategy are the initial imperative steps to mitigate the threat to wetlands."
"Independent response of soil DOM to MAT and MAP: Evidence from a large-scale survey of moss crusts in mainland China Biogeochemistry; Cyclotron Resonance; Aliphatic Compounds It is known soil dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in global biogeochemical cycle and is an important factor in soil-forming processes. However, the linkage between the diversity of chemical composition and properties of DOM molecules and the climatic conditions (temperature, precipitation) at regional scales is still not well studied. Therefore, in our study, we selected 33 soil DOM samples which were, divided into temperature-variation and precipitation-variation groups, and used Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to analyze the influence of climate on the chemical characterizations of DOM. Our results showed that although the factors affecting the chemical properties of DOM are complex, mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT) can explain part of the chemical changes of DOM, and the two data sets in this study can well separate the effects of MAP and MAT on DOM, respectively. The results showed that the content of lignin and tannin were positively related to MAP, while carbohydrate, lipid, unsaturated hydrocarbon and protein decreased with the increase in MAP. The content of nitrogen-containing molecules gradually decreased with the increase in MAT. Meanwhile, the content of sulfur-containing molecules was almost unaffected by the MAP and MAT. In terms of DOM composition, the content of protein decreased with the increase in MAT. The results suggested that the chemical characteristics of DOM is an ecosystem attribute that is closely related to the environment and may be used to predict large-scale soil biochemical processes in the soil carbon cycle."
"A review on electrochemically modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) membrane for desalination and purification of water Multi Walled Nanotube; Adsorption; Graphene Oxide Recently extraordinary breakthroughs have been made towards applying nano-structured materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and porous graphene membranes in water purification and desalination applications. In this regard, the potential of the electrochemically active carbon nanotube (CNTs) membrane has been highly strengthened for the last few decades. One of the main advantages for such approach is the capability of CNT channel to permit the water flow easily. The perusal of the literature showed that, the performance of CNT based membrane can be three times higher than that of the conventional membrane devices. The unique and excellent characteristics of CNT membrane can outperform the conventional polymer membranes. CNT membrane has been widely used to adsorb chemical and biological contaminants as well as ion separation from sea water due to their high stability, great flexibility, and large specific surface area. Electrochemically active CNT filters deliver further Electro-oxidation of the adsorbed contaminants. Usually polymeric membranes have flexible chains for which it fails to have well-defined pores necessary for filtration. On the contrary CNTs based filters can provide pores with appropriate sizes and configurations by tailoring the growth parameters. The narrow pores of CNTs are capable of filtering water while eliminating ions (Na+/Cl-). Even this type of membranes is capable of removing bacteria from water and heavy hydrocarbon from petroleum. However, the success of desalination entirely depends on the basic design of the CNT-based filter with detailed optimization of the process parameters. Polymer filters cannot be recurrently used through several cycles since elimination of fouling ingredients is difficult. Even though electrochemically active CNT-based membranes have lot of advantages due to their hydrophobic nature, high porosity and specific area; there are numerous traits, which are yet to be considered and optimized. Thus the intrinsic properties of CNT as well as the fabrication of the membrane could be a critical factor for their applicability in various water treatment processes. This chapter provides an explicit and systematic overview of the recent progress of electrochemically active CNT membranes addressing the current prevalent problems associated with water treatment and desalination. The physio-chemical aspect including the working principles of this type of membrane have been discussed. The prevailing challenges and future perceptions are also discussed."
"Unsustainability at the crossroads of climate change and air pollution sciences: implications for sustainable development and the scholarship of sustainability Indonesia; Swamp Forest; Biomass Burning Release of carbonaceous aerosols â€“ comprising black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) â€“ from biomass burning into the atmosphere is dependent on the burning conditions as to the resultant relative abundances of the emitted BC and OC. This provides a way of managing biomass burning in terms of manipulating the types of emitted aerosol. The carbonaceous aerosols are concerned in different ways in different scientific fields. The BC and OC exert complex implications for (a) radiative forcing in climate change science but (b) public health concern in air pollution science. Referring to these complex implications, a case of sustainability is constructed, which is being unsustainably dealt with at the crossroads of the sciences. This reveals an inadequacy of the reductionist mode of enquiry, necessitating a new mode with unique epistemological orientation for the scholarship of sustainability. The necessity of integration of perspectives that are currently segregated for this sustainability issue and the implications for sustainable development are elucidated.

"Employers’ perspectives on vietnamese returnee students China; Internationalization Process; Student Mobility Central to the current debate on international education is the graduate outcomes of the students engaged in various modes of provision. The question raised is whether these studentsâ€™ graduate attributes are welcome in their targeted regional, national and local labour market. This chapter is based on the conceptual framework, demonstrating job-relevant graduates as a key mechanism for host country human resource development and/ or capacity development for domestic higher education in addressing insufficient supply of quality skilled workforce. It reflects employersâ€™ perspectives on the employability of Vietnamese returnees in seeking their employment at locally-based multinational companies compared with those graduated from transnational and domestic education sectors. It describes perceptions of twelve experienced senior HR managers working in various key industries in Vietnam regarding the graduatesâ€™ knowledge, skills, mindset, language and corporate culture adaptation. The findings highlight returnees and transnational education (TNE) graduates attributes as more satisfactory to local skill demands. The study shows employersâ€™ preferences on TNE graduatesâ€™ mindset and credential language competency but in some cases, their lack of interest in returneesâ€™ foreign language and intercultural skills."
"Understanding opportunities for social impact investment in the development of affordable housing Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Key findings This is the first study examining the opportunities for, barriers to, and risks for SII in the development of affordable housing in Australia. It considers both social housing and affordable housing supply. Social impact investment (SII) SIIs are those that intentionally target specific social objectives along with a financial return and measure the achievement of both (SIIT 2014a: 2). SII funds can be placed directly by investors or through intermediaries who specialise (sometimes exclusively) in placing SII funds. Intermediaries often, but not always, pool funds. Intermediaries take responsibility for measuring and reporting of impact. The return expectations and assets classes can differ: investors willing to accept concessionary returns (i.e. a below market return) are considered 'impact-first' investors while those requiring non-concessionary returns equal or near equal to market are considered to be 'finance-first' investors (Brest and Born 2013). Deals can be complex, involving other SI investors, concessionary and non-concessionary investment, non-SI investors and philanthropic and other grants. Such deals are termed 'layered' investments. Investment can involve debt, equity or both. The SI investors Westpac Banking Corporation, Community Sector Banking and Bank Australia are the largest SI investors in social and affordable housing in Australia, by virtue of lending to CHPs. Westpac has $1.05 billion invested in the CHP sector (Westpac 2016). Total bank SII in the CHP sector is possibly as much as $1.5 billion at present. This investment is all debt investment. Returns are non-concessionary. Historically, access to capital has been difficult for CHPs and investment has required reconsideration of risk and a shift in credit assessment. This change may or may not have been led by SI investors (further research would be required to answer this question). The participation of bank SI investors however adds competition ensuring all CHPs gain more competitively priced capital and more suitable conditions on finance. Given the concentration of the Australian banking sector (Bryant 2012) this competition is important. This bank SII therefore could be said to be providing 'additionality'. A far smaller $20 million is invested in housing models outside of the registered CHP sector, by non-bank SI investors. These include the Lord Mayors Charitable Foundation (LMCF) who provided $3 million to the Affordable Housing Loan Fund (AHLF), small superannuation funds, high net worth individuals (HNWI), other individuals, philanthropy, self-managed superannuation funds (SMSF), and not-for-profit (NFP) organisations. This $20 million is equal parts debt and equity investment. The equity investors in these models were the only investors to accept concessionary returns. They were supporting innovative models that have the potential for systemic change rather than simply providing housing. Intermediaries Three intermediaries, Foresters Community Finance (FCF), Social Enterprise Finance Australia (SEFA) and Social Ventures Australia (SVA) are currently responsible for the placement of the majority of non-bank SII in social/affordable housing in Australia. These intermediaries have attracted funds from HNWI, NAB, Triodos Bank, Community Sector Banking, Christian Super, HESTA, and the NSW Aboriginal Land Council. These intermediaries are highly respected. All three funds were established following an Australian Government initiative, the Social Enterprise Development and Investment Funds (SEDIFs) that provided $20 million in matched funding. Christian Super recently established its own intermediary, Bright Light. Demand side for investment CHPs are the largest source of demand for funds and represent the only established system of social and affordable housing provision that comprises an at-scale opportunity for expanded SII, which meets the requirements for verifiable impact over time. The opportunity for SII is limited however by CHP sector constraints (issues well documented, see Milligan, Hulse, et al. 2013; Milligan, Pawson et al. 2017) including limited free cash flow (to support borrowings), uncertain tenant housing assistance and income support, and reduced discretion over tenant allocation. Government policy change is viewed as a key source of risk affecting investment (current and future). Two other models were able to access mainstream finance but were not part of the CHP sector. There were a number of organisations currently outside the CHP sector unable to access mainstream lending. These projects span income cohorts-from households eligible for public housing to middle income households-and provide both rental and home ownership opportunities. These non-CHP models expressed dissatisfaction with the existing CHP model and with market provision. A new SII typology SII in Australia does not fit the simple impact-first versus finance-first investment typology found in the literature. Investor reconceptualisation of risk and modification of lending practices occurred in addition to consideration of return requirements. This was not a case of accepting greater risk but rather of reviewing the generally accepted credit assessment practice. Figure 1 describes this new Australian SII typology, which adds whether the investor adopted an orthodox or 'reformed' approach to credit assessment in addition to their approach to returns. Using this new typology, we find that most SII in Australia can be described as partial finance-first, reflecting a combination of non-concessionary returns and modified investment parameters. A far smaller proportion of SII is full impact-first, in that concessionary returns were acceptable and investment parameters were modified. We found no fully finance-first or partial impact-first investment. Barriers and opportunities The CHP sector is the target of most SII, and most existing and potential SI investors wish to see the sector greatly expanded. Government capital grants are regarded as necessary to grow the sector and enable SII at a greater scale. Investment is currently constrained by the lack of CHP free cash flow, rather than lack of collateral required for security. Adverse changes to welfare and housing assistance, and government policy restricting housing allocations to the highest priority applicants on public housing waiting lists were identified as affecting CHP cash flow and as such presenting a risk to investment. Policy development options SII in social and affordable housing reflects government investment. As private investment, there is an expectation of returns on investment. Investment therefore only occurs when the housing organisation is able to generate a positive cash flow to support debt repayment or disbursements to equity holders. This requires the gap between tenant's capacity to pay and the cost of housing provision to be funded by government. The funding of this gap provides an implicit government guarantee. In the Australian context, this requires: â€¢ An annual funding stream for CHPs to close the gap between rental revenues and cost of provision. â€¢ State and territory governments to permit CHPs discretion in who they house so that investor confidence can be maintained (in the absence of a funding stream to meet the gap between rental revenues and cost of provision). â€¢ An annual capital grants program for CHPs to grow the sector. â€¢ Growth of the sector to create the conditions for bond financing-bonds lower the cost of capital and provide for long tenure debt. â€¢ Welfare entitlements and housing assistance to provide sufficient income to all household types to ensure the most vulnerable households will be attractive to house. Social security entitlements need to be stable in order to provide confidence to investors regarding their existing investments as well as future investments. Housing supply bonds were viewed as a key opportunity for reducing the cost of capital and enabling long tenure debt. Land is a critical issue affecting affordability of housing and access to employment and services by vulnerable households. â€¢ Government are frequently owners of well-located land that is surplus to their requirements. Governments could grant such surplus government land to CHPs (as is envisaged by part 21(k) of the National Affordable Housing Agreement (NAHA)). â€¢ Inclusionary zoning could be implemented to provide a new source of social and affordable housing on existing redevelopment sites. Inclusionary zoning would provide the opportunity for layered investment models, common in the US. â€¢ Governments could consider capturing the uplift in value when re-zoning land, through making part of rezoned sites available to CHPs or other NFP housing providers. SII in new home ownership models is able to generate affordable housing supply for both low-income and intermediate income cohorts. The growth of some of these models could be assisted through: â€¢ Government guarantees to permit debt financing and negate the need for substantial equity contributions. â€¢ Revolving funds to provide equity to development projects. The equity would be returned once mortgage loans are issued. The market price of housing for purchase is affected by many factors. However, there has been little scrutiny of the development process and particularly of multi-unit residential development. Profit margins in this sector are high, suggesting competition is less effective than it could be. There is a need for policy-makers to gain a detailed understanding of residential property development and possible industry reforms to improve efficiency. SII would be assisted by: â€¢ As fiduciary duties of superannuation fund managers appear to be open to interpretation, government could review this aspect of superannuation fund management to provide legal clarity for concessionary SII. The study This report presents findings from a research project conducted as part of a broader AHURI Inquiry into social impact investment for housing and homelessness outcomes (Muir, Findlay et al. forthcoming). The purpose of this research is to investigate what contribution SII can make to increasing the supply of affordable housing through providing a detailed analysis of: i) SII in affordable housing internationally and in Australia, ii) opportunities and risks for SII in Australia, iii) barriers to investment, iv) potential for innovation and v) measures government and other parties can take to encourage investment. To date there has been no review of SII in the development of social and affordable housing in Australia. While SII is increasingly of interest in relation to homelessness and housing vulnerability, its application to housing supply has not attracted the same kind of policy attention, despite international and Australian examples. Little therefore is known of investments, the quantum of investment, who the investors are, their motivations or the impact arising from their investment. The registered CHP sector is often presumed to constitute the demand for SII funds. Intermediaries have been established, and many are keen to funnel SII into housing. Much of the advocacy for SII has centred on superannuation funds and on housing supply bonds as a means to attract superannuation funds with CHPs. It is a discussion that reflects a deep concern about the lack of affordable housing stock and mounting frustration at the lack of opportunities for investment. In order to appreciate the implications of private investment including SII, in the supply of social and affordable housing it is necessary to understand residential development financing, and specifically project finance. As we will outline however, private investment in social and affordable housing is not a straightforward matter. This research involved: â€¢ a review of national and international literature on SII in affordable housing â€¢ analysis of in-depth interviews with experts in government, and with SI investors and intermediaries, and CHPs about the definition of SII, its purpose in relation to social/affordable housing, how it has been applied and its benefits in regard to the supply of social and affordable housing in Australia."
An integrated nanoplasmonic biosensor for monitoring cytokine secretion from single cells Light Transmission; Plasmonics; Metals An innovative nanoplasmonic biosensor was presented for real-time label-free monitoring of cytokine secretion at single-cell resolution. This biosensor is integrated with a uniquely designed microfluidic device that provides a microchamber for cell incubation and fluid regulation for stable live cell monitoring. Different spatiotemporal profiles of interleukin-2 secretion were observed from single lymphoma cells. This novel configuration of label-free biosensor is promising for single-cell related studies.
"The role of Australian local government in economic development: Building international engagement capacity International New Ventures; Born Global; Small And Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) Sister city relationships (SCRs) are a platform through which local governments (LGs) engage internationally. Increasingly, there is an expectation that such international engagement delivers economic opportunities and returns. Many LGs are therefore pursuing local economic development (LED) through their SCRs. Drawing on a national survey of Australian LGs (stage 1) and interviews with key council staff and stakeholders in five LG areas maintaining Australiaâ€“China SCRs (stage 2), this paper contributes to growing literature on LED by examining how LGs have developed their own capacities and supported local small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to engage internationally. Our findings reveal insights into how Australian LGs have achieved international engagement through two strategies that leverage their SCRs, namely building government's capabilities and developing SMEsâ€™ capabilities. This paper contributes new insights into the evolving role of LGs in LED, including both current experimentation, challenges, and future opportunities. Points for practitioners: A growing number of Australian local governments pursue LED through their Chinese sister city relationships. Supporting the internationalisation of SMEs is an emerging component of local government pursuit of LED. International engagement of local governments has necessitated enhanced capacities in human, external, and financial resources. Findings highlight the unique and often overlooked role of local-to-local diplomatic and economic relations."
"‘You’re actually the problem’: manifestations of populist masculinist anxieties in Australian higher education Student Evaluation of Teaching; Course Evaluation; University Teacher In 2016 the world witnessed a consolidation of a western brand of political â€˜populist authoritarianismâ€™ that is anti-globalisationalist and creates â€˜shared objects of loathingâ€™ in the popular imagination. This article engages with the implications of this affective and masculinist â€˜post-truthâ€™ era for higher education and analyses the narratives of teacher educators who teach compulsory classes based on inclusion and diversity. The article uses the work of feminist, Indigenous and queer theorists to explore gendered responses to pedagogical encounters recounted in the data. We offer a reading of these experiences that links white male objections, particularly around the teaching of gender and race, to the growth of neoconservatism that precipitated the contemporary rise of populist authoritarianism. The pedagogical encounters we explore reflect the notion that the Australian white male is a figure who is brought undone by allowing the subaltern to speak."
"Rapid adsorption of PFAS: Application of Moringa oleifera seed powder encapsulated in alginate beads Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Adsorption processes are increasingly used for removing perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from aqueous systems. However, issues including slow adsorption kinetics, competition with other organics such as humic substances, and the fact that many commercial adsorbents are sourced from non-renewable materials can hinder their application. Calcium alginate beads with integrated Moringa oleifera (MO) seed powder were investigated as an alternative adsorbent for addressing these issues. The beads fabricated under different formulation conditions were evaluated as a proof of concept for their adsorption performance of two PFAS compounds (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS)) that are frequently found in PFAS-contaminated water. The beads exhibited fast kinetics with equilibrium reached in 30 min and a high adsorption capacity (up to 941.7 Î¼g gâˆ’1) for PFOS. The presence of humic acid (HA) did not greatly affect PFOS adsorption, demonstrating the potential of the beads as a promising adsorbent for long-chain PFAS removal from aqueous streams. The results of adsorption experiments and adsorbent characterization indicated that PFAS adsorption was dominated by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The adsorption efficiency appeared to be related to Câ€“F chain length as the removal efficiency of the short-chain PFAS compound (PFBS) was found to be lower than 10%."
"World city futures: The role of urban and regional policies in the Asia Pacific region Hukou; China; Land Development This chapter addresses six major policy issues that confront planners concerned with placing their cities in the top rank of the world hierarchy: spatial organization, regional governance, social and environmental sustainability, migrant workers, the rise of civil society, and intercity networks. It reviews the geography of global capitalism, because the â€˜regional levelâ€™ to which A. J. Scott refers is precisely the level of world city formation. The chief sources of demographic growth for the mega-city regions come from rural migration and international migration, though Asian world cities are beginning to experience international migration as well. Rural households in world city regions are tightly integrated with an urban economy that is grounded in manufacturing and business services. The hyper-urbanizing cities of Asia are thus drawing on the so-called surplus population of rural and small town areas within their own country, although migrant workers are beginning to arrive in larger numbers also from abroad."
"Effectiveness and Safety of Oral Cordyceps sinensis on Stable COPD of GOLD Stages 2-3: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Cordyceps; Fungi; Hepialus Cordyceps sinensis (CS) is a complementary medicine used for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) of Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages 2-3. Many randomized controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of CS alone or in combination with other herbs on stable COPD. To provide a synthesis of the evidence, we searched nine major electronic databases for randomized controlled trials on CS published before 21st December 2016. Fifteen interventional studies, including 1,238 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that both CS preparations and CS formulae showed the potential benefits in lung function, exercise endurance, life quality, and improvement of symptoms. No serious adverse events were reported. So CS may be a promising treatment for patients with stable COPD of GOLD stages 2-3. No studies were placebo-controlled or of high methodological quality, which limits the conclusions."
"Measuring progress from 1990 to 2017 and projecting attainment to 2030 of the health-related Sustainable Development Goals for 195 countries and territories: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 Global Burden of Disease; Disability-Adjusted Life Year; Disability Weights Background: Efforts to establish the 2015 baseline and monitor early implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) highlight both great potential for and threats to improving health by 2030. To fully deliver on the SDG aim of â€œleaving no one behindâ€, it is increasingly important to examine the health-related SDGs beyond national-level estimates. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017), we measured progress on 41 of 52 health-related SDG indicators and estimated the health-related SDG index for 195 countries and territories for the period 1990â€“2017, projected indicators to 2030, and analysed global attainment. Methods: We measured progress on 41 health-related SDG indicators from 1990 to 2017, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2016 (new indicators were health worker density, sexual violence by non-intimate partners, population census status, and prevalence of physical and sexual violence [reported separately]). We also improved the measurement of several previously reported indicators. We constructed national-level estimates and, for a subset of health-related SDGs, examined indicator-level differences by sex and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintile. We also did subnational assessments of performance for selected countries. To construct the health-related SDG index, we transformed the value for each indicator on a scale of 0â€“100, with 0 as the 2Â·5th percentile and 100 as the 97Â·5th percentile of 1000 draws calculated from 1990 to 2030, and took the geometric mean of the scaled indicators by target. To generate projections through 2030, we used a forecasting framework that drew estimates from the broader GBD study and used weighted averages of indicator-specific and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2017 to inform future estimates. We assessed attainment of indicators with defined targets in two ways: first, using mean values projected for 2030, and then using the probability of attainment in 2030 calculated from 1000 draws. We also did a global attainment analysis of the feasibility of attaining SDG targets on the basis of past trends. Using 2015 global averages of indicators with defined SDG targets, we calculated the global annualised rates of change required from 2015 to 2030 to meet these targets, and then identified in what percentiles the required global annualised rates of change fell in the distribution of country-level rates of change from 1990 to 2015. We took the mean of these global percentile values across indicators and applied the past rate of change at this mean global percentile to all health-related SDG indicators, irrespective of target definition, to estimate the equivalent 2030 global average value and percentage change from 2015 to 2030 for each indicator. Findings: The global median health-related SDG index in 2017 was 59Â·4 (IQR 35Â·4â€“67Â·3), ranging from a low of 11Â·6 (95% uncertainty interval 9Â·6â€“14Â·0) to a high of 84Â·9 (83Â·1â€“86Â·7). SDG index values in countries assessed at the subnational level varied substantially, particularly in China and India, although scores in Japan and the UK were more homogeneous. Indicators also varied by SDI quintile and sex, with males having worse outcomes than females for non-communicable disease (NCD) mortality, alcohol use, and smoking, among others. Most countries were projected to have a higher health-related SDG index in 2030 than in 2017, while country-level probabilities of attainment by 2030 varied widely by indicator. Under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria indicators had the most countries with at least 95% probability of target attainment. Other indicators, including NCD mortality and suicide mortality, had no countries projected to meet corresponding SDG targets on the basis of projected mean values for 2030 but showed some probability of attainment by 2030. For some indicators, including child malnutrition, several infectious diseases, and most violence measures, the annualised rates of change required to meet SDG targets far exceeded the pace of progress achieved by any country in the recent past. We found that applying the mean global annualised rate of change to indicators without defined targets would equate to about 19% and 22% reductions in global smoking and alcohol consumption, respectively; a 47% decline in adolescent birth rates; and a more than 85% increase in health worker density per 1000 population by 2030. Interpretation: The GBD study offers a unique, robust platform for monitoring the health-related SDGs across demographic and geographic dimensions. Our findings underscore the importance of increased collection and analysis of disaggregated data and highlight where more deliberate design or targeting of interventions could accelerate progress in attaining the SDGs. Current projections show that many health-related SDG indicators, NCDs, NCD-related risks, and violence-related indicators will require a concerted shift away from what might have driven past gainsâ€”curative interventions in the case of NCDsâ€”towards multisectoral, prevention-oriented policy action and investments to achieve SDG aims. Notably, several targets, if they are to be met by 2030, demand a pace of progress that no country has achieved in the recent past. The future is fundamentally uncertain, and no model can fully predict what breakthroughs or events might alter the course of the SDGs. What is clear is that our actionsâ€”or inactionâ€”today will ultimately dictate how close the world, collectively, can get to leaving no one behind by 2030. Funding: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation."
"Valuation of collateralized debt obligations: An equilibrium model Credit Default Swaps; Costs And Cost Analysis; Credit Risk In this paper, we present a new equilibrium model for pricing collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The model is grounded on option pricing theory and features a random jump size to account for default correlation across reference entities. This feature is important for pricing CDOs during times of market turmoil. Simulation results show that jump size volatility, capturing uncertainty about the size of simultaneous corporate defaults, is a key parameter in pricing CDOs. The effect of jump size volatility on CDO spreads is substantial and depends on the relative position of the mean jump size to loss-coverage limits."
"Introduction: Early childhood education policy reforms in Australia and China Comparative Education; China; UNESCO This chapter introduces early childhood education, policies and reforms and a collaborative partnership to explore comparative perspectives in early childhood across Australia and China. In this book we draw on the research literature to develop a picture of early childhood education in the two countries and to provide background and context. Early childhood education has been identified by governments and policy makers as a strategy to counter inequality and support economic growth. Continuous reform, in terms of access, quality of the services provided and the training required by the workforce are a focus of policy development and also the subject of the research projects described in this book. The value of comparative studies is discussed and the usefulness of exploring early childhood education and care initiatives across borders contemplated. Debates in Australia and China have been introduced in order to reflect on the influence of internationalisation and globalisation in shaping educational policy, practice and relationships. This introduction describes the organisation of the book, comments on the nuanced nature of comparative studies when knowledge is shared across borders and touches on some of the questions that arise from the research projects reported upon."
"Climate Shocks and Social Networks: Understanding Adaptation among Rural Indian Households Crops; CERES (Experiment); Climate Change Impact This paper seeks to uncover the impact of negative rainfall shocks on household social network relationships. I leverage the uncertainty generated from fluctuating long-term rainfall patterns across India, to estimate the impact of heightened climate risks on investments in social network relationships. In so doing, I attempt to disentangle the â€œdirectâ€ and â€œadaptiveâ€ impacts of climate shocks on social network relationships. I found that households that experience higher than average negative rainfall shocks (lower than average rainfall levels over the long term) tend to invest more in familyâ€“caste and vertical or linked network relationships. These network relationships were also found to be associated with greater access to financial credit, credit sourced specifically from family members, higher reported collaboration, more diversified businesses, and the use of private irrigation technologies, all of which are key to mitigating the negative impacts of climate shocks. Unlike past research, these results suggest that householdsâ€™ decisions to invest in social networks may be an adaptive response to higher climate risk. In terms of policy implications, these results highlight the importance of strengthening and supporting family-based and linked networks (such as links to local governmental agencies and extension services) in the face of higher climate risks."
"Surprising Pseudogobius: Molecular systematics of benthic gobies reveals new insights into estuarine biodiversity (Teleostei: Gobiiformes) Animals; Maccullochella Macquariensis; Percichthyidae Snubnose gobies (genus Pseudogobius: Gobionellinae) are ubiquitous to, and important components of, estuarine ecosystems of the Indo-west Pacific. These small benthic fishes occur in freshwater, brackish and marine habitats such as mangroves, sheltered tide pools and lowland streams, and represent a model group for understanding the biodiversity and biogeography of estuarine fauna. To develop the species-level framework required for a concurrent morphological taxonomic appraisal, we undertook thorough sampling around the extensive Australian coastline, referenced to international locations, as part of a molecular systematic review using both nuclear and mitochondrial markers. The results indicate that while there are currently eight recognised species, the true diversity is close to double this, with a hotspot of endemism located in Australia. Complicated patterns were observed in southern Australia owing to two differing zones of introgression/admixture. Key drivers of diversity in the group appear to include plate tectonics, latitude, and historic barriers under glacial maxima, where an interplay between ready dispersal and habitat specialisation has led to regional panmixia but frequent geographic compartmentalisation within past and present landscapes. The findings have significant implications for biodiversity conservation, coastal and estuarine development, the basic foundations of field ecology, and for applied use such as in biomonitoring."
"A Survey on Modern Deep Neural Network for Traffic Prediction: Trends, Methods and Challenges Artificial Intelligence; Travel Time; Advanced Traveler Information Systems In this modern era, traffic congestion has become a major source of severe negative economic and environmental impact for urban areas worldwide. One of the most efficient ways to mitigate traffic congestion is through future traffic prediction. The research field of traffic prediction has evolved greatly ever since its inception in the late 70s. Earlier studies mainly use classical statistical models such as ARIMA and its variants. Recently, researchers have started to focus on machine learning models because of their power and flexibility. As theoretical and technological advances emerge, we enter the era of deep neural network, which gained popularity due to its sheer prediction power which can be attributed to the complex and deep structure. Despite the popularity of deep neural network models in the field of traffic prediction, literature surveys of such methods are rare. In this work, we present an up-to-date survey of deep neural network for traffic prediction. We will provide a detailed explanation of popular deep neural network architectures commonly used in the traffic flow prediction literatures, categorize and describe the literatures themselves, present an overview of the commonalities and differences among different works, and finally provide a discussion regarding the challenges and future directions for this field."
"The Environmental Kuznets Curve in the OECD: 1870–2014 Environmental Kuznets Curve; China; Trade Openness Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions play an important role in global warming. Consequently, studying the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic development is important, especially when viewed from a historical perspective. We test the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for a panel of 20 OECD nations, dating back to the first globalization boom in the nineteenth century. Utilising recently developed panel data estimators that account for cross-sectional dependence and parameter heterogeneity, for the period 1870 to 2014, we find support for the EKC hypothesis for the panel as a whole with three of our preferred four estimators, with turning points in income per capita that lie between $18,955 and $89,540 (in 1990 US$). Country-specific results, however, only provide mixed support for the EKC hypothesis. Specifically, we find evidence of an EKC for nine of the 20 countries, with five exhibiting a traditional inverted U-shaped relationship, three exhibiting an N-shaped relationship and one, an inverted N-shaped relationship."
"Determining the value of cooling in photovoltaics for enhanced energy yield Hot Temperature; Phase Change Materials; Photovoltaic System Methods for cooling photovoltaic (PV) modules to increase their output have been proposed several times in the literature. Most of these reports describe the increase in power output achieved, but they rarely comment on the economic cost-benefit proposition. Where the economics have been considered, this has been based on measurements for the authorsâ€™ specific PV system at a specific site. This means the economics are not easily interpreted for other systems at other sites. We derive a theoretical formulation for quantifying the economic value of artificial cooling of PV modules. The formulation is not specific to any particular method of cooling. It takes as input the rate of heat removal that a cooling method can provide (in Wmâ€“2 or Wmâ€“2Kâˆ’1) and determines the economic value of this cooling rate, based on variables including local solar conditions, capital cost of the system, system ventilation, plus the temperature coefficient and efficiency of the modules. We find that the economic value of cooling PV depends strongly on the system design and local conditions, with favourable circumstances leading to a viable cost of potentially over $40/m2, however unfavourable circumstances are many times less attractive at less than $1/m2. The equations presented can be used to optimise the design of a cooling feature that is applied to a PV module or system, provided the above parameters of the cooling feature and PV system are established."
"Organizational Learning from Prescribed Fire Escapes: a Review of Developments Over the Last 10 Years in the USA and Australia Fuel Treatment; Climate Change; Fire Severity Purpose of Review: Prescribed fire escapes continue to challenge most fire and land management agencies and many communities. This article considers the issue from knowledge management (KM) and organizational learning (OL) perspectives. We review organizational initiatives and the literature that have developed over the last 10 years to support learning from escaped prescribed fires, then use this to evaluate current learning practices and identify potential next frontiers for improving performance. Due to the difficulty obtaining statistics for non-federal entities, this review focuses primarily on developments in the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, but also captures reviews from the US Department of Interior, and the State of Victoria, Australia. Recent Findings: The recurring issue of prescribed fire escapes may in part be explained by the increasing challenges and expectations fire and land management agencies and prescribed fire managers face. Agencies are being asked to burn more area and suitably contain prescribed fires with fewer resources. In many jurisdictions, this challenge is heightened by increasingly tough climate conditions, shifting demographics internal and external to their agencies, changing patterns of land use, and requirements to meet increasing fuel reduction targets. A range of interventions has been developed and implemented by state and federal land and fire management agencies to support improved performance through KM and OL. However, prescribed fires continue to escape, often for the same reasons they always have, leading us to ask: is there a next frontier or level for improving performance though learning? Summary: This paper reviews recent developments in KM and OL to develop a model of organizational learning for prescribed fire. We then use this lens to review learning from prescribed burn escapes in Australia and the USA, highlighting the opportunities and challenges that agencies continue to face. Four areas of concentration to further strengthen OL are proposed, namely (i) strengthening the organizational learning culture, (ii) greater use of communities of practice to enhance lesson sharing, (iii) addressing the slow build time for prescribed burning expertise to replace pending retirements, and (iv) improving non-technical skills and human factors training."
"The association between major dietary patterns and severe mental disorders symptoms among a large sample of adults living in central Iran: Baseline data of YaHS-TAMYZ cohort study Eating Habits; Vegetable Consumption; Cross-Sectional Studies Background: The dietâ€™s role in developing psychological disorders has been considered by researchers in recent years. Objective: To examine the association between major dietary patterns and severe mental disorders symptoms in a large sample of adults living in Yazd city, central Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study used the baseline data of a population-based cohort study (Yazd Health study: YaHS). Dietary intakes were assessed by a multiple-choice semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ, Yazd nutrition survey called TAMYZ). Psychological assessments were also done by using the depression, anxiety, and stress scale-21 (DASS-21) questionnaire. Major dietary patterns were identified using principal component analysis (PCA). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between dietary patterns and mental disorders symptoms. Results: A total of 7574 adults were included in the current analysis. Four major dietary patterns were identified: ""Sugar and Fatsâ€, â€œProcessed Meats and Fishâ€, ""Fruits"" and â€œVegetables and Red Meatâ€. After adjustment for all confounding variables, participants in the fifth quintile of â€œFruitsâ€ dietary pattern which was highly correlated with dried fruits, canned fruits, fruit juice, olive, hydrogenated fats and fruits intake, had a lower odds of severe depression (OR=0.61, 95% CI: 0.45â€“0.81, p for trend=0.057), anxiety (OR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.50â€“0.80, p for trend=0.007), and stress, (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.30â€“0.68, p for trend=0.081). Conclusions: The intake of a dietary pattern high in dried fruits, canned fruits, fruit juice, olive, hydrogenated fats, and fruits might be inversely associated with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Future prospective studies are needed to warrant this finding."
"Research priorities and best practices for managing climate risk and climate change adaptation in Australian agriculture Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience The challenges of climate change adaptation in agriculture are examined through the lens of priorities for research, and the use of best management practices (BMPs) to better manage climate risks. The methods and results have two parts. Firstly, a case study from the northern grains region examines the use of BMPs for managing climate risks associated with both climate variability and climate change. A series of industry workshops developed and tested a suite of 24 BMP standards for growing dryland grain crops, including four BMPs on risk management based on the Australian Standards for Risk Management. Secondly, priorities for research on climate change adaptation in the primary industries sector are described and evaluated to assess needs for updating, in response to industry and environmental changes. The analysis reveals strong reasons for increasing the priority given to education and extension on risk management and for developing BMPs for both incremental and transformative adaptation, and especially for deriving methods to achieve widespread adoption of BMPs for managing extreme climatic events. Collaborative development of BMPs involving farmersâ€™/industry/scientists is the process most likely to derive robust BMPs to withstand the complexities of climate risk and build greater resilience of communities and ecosystems."
"Recycling biosolids as cement composites in raw, pyrolyzed and ashed forms: A waste utilisation approach to support circular economy Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Ongoing management of biosolids has emerged as a major economic challenge for wastewater treatment facilities around the world. To tackle this challenge, it becomes imperative for the researcher community to identify various applications for this waste material, simultaneously supporting the government's closed-loop circular economy initiative. This research investigates the use of biosolids in raw, pyrolyzed (biochar), and ashed (bioash) forms as cement replacement materials. Detailed material characterization was carried out on the raw cementitious material followed by that on the hydrated cement composites using X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur (CHNS) analysis, Xray micro-computed tomography and compressive strength test to identify their mechanical and physicochemical properties. The results show that the addition of 10% biosolids in the blended cement composite increased its total porosity by more than 21 times and decreased its compressive strength by 80% at 28 days of curing, indicating its potential use as an air-entraining admixture for the low-density concrete. However, the addition of 10% biochar brought about a strength improvement of ~278% and a reduction in its total porosity by ~87% compared to that of the biosolids blended cement composites. Partial replacement of cement with 10% bioash (ash form) showed ~66% reduction in its total porosity and 11% reduction in the 28-day compressive-strength compared to that of the biochar blended cement composites. Overall, this study demonstrates that the different forms of biosolids (raw, biochar, and bioash) can potentially be used as cement replacement materials with varied benefits in the cement and concrete industry. The recommendation for the future work is to carry out long-term durability studies on these blended cement composites for the ready uptake of this waste material by the construction industry."
"Warm stratification and optimised temperatures improve conservation of the endangered orchid, Caladenia robinsonii (Orchidaceae) Germination; Tulasnella; Cephalanthera Context: Maximising seed germination and seedling development is critical for conservation of endangered plants around the world. Orchidaceae is one of the most threatened plant families and can be one of the most difficult to propagate ex situ. Three critical, but potentially limiting, factors are important for orchid germination, namely, conducive conditions, 'ready-to-germinate' seed and effective mycorrhizal fungi. Aims: Our aim was to improve poor germination in vitro of a recalcitrant Australian endangered orchid, Caladenia robinsonii, and to predict the potential impacts of climate change on this species. Methods: Three experiments were conducted to optimise germination in C. robinsonii, with a focus on temperature. In Experiment 1, on the basis of meteorological data, three constant temperatures (15Â°C, 20Â°C and 27Â°C) were tested. In Experiment 2, the optimal constant temperature was compared with diurnally varying temperatures of 22Â°C/18Â°C (12/12 h), with and without warm stratification at 30Â°C/27Â°C (12/12 h) for 1 week. In Experiment 3, the same diurnally varying temperature and warm stratification were tested using multiple orchid mycorrhizal fungal isolates cultured from wild and re-introduced populations of C. robinsonii. Key results: Without warm stratification, germination was greatest at 20Â°C (21%), but only 4% of seedlings developed to the green-leaf stage, whereas fungal growth was greatest at 27Â°C. Stratification increased germination (79%) and development to the green-leaf stage (47%), but more so with subsequent incubation under constant 20Â°C than diurnal 22Â°C/18Â°C. Fungal isolate affected total germination (53-69%) and development to the green-leaf stage (26-41%); isolates from the wild population were less effective than were those from re-introductions. Conclusions: Warm stratification and specific seasonal temperatures significantly improved germination, both factors being typical of seeds with physiological dormancy. Implications: Mimicking in situ conditions can provide a strong basis for ex situ germination strategies and predicting future outcomes. Winter-spring flowering orchid seedlings are commonly observed in autumn, and warm stratification should be considered for improving germination of similar orchid species. However, future climate warming may reduce in situ seedling recruitment."
"Does tenure matter for occupant experiences of low-energy housing? Insulation; Energy; Energy Saving in Building International policy settings are looking toward low-energy and near zero-energy homes as a solution to address environmental impacts, particularly anthropogenic climate change. There is increasing research evaluating sustainable housing developments from a technical and occupant perspective. One of the key determinants of household energy use is tenure. However, there is limited research which has looked at if tenure impacts on how occupants experience low-energy homes. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring three low-energy housing developments and exploring the role of tenure in relation to how the households experience the dwellings. The case studies demonstrate that social housing tenants have frustrations with a lack of control over what they could, or could not, do to their low-energy dwellings, in comparison to owner-occupier housing."
"The business case for social housing as infrastructure Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Business cases and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) are conventional features of infrastructure decision-making processes in Australia, and are used to evaluate the societal benefit of proposed projects. However, business cases and CBA have been contentious in terms of design and deployment. Funding commitments are regularly made prior to the completion of business cases and CBA, diminishing their value as a decisive part of infrastructure development decisions. For social housing, business case and CBA processes could provide useful evidence of the wider societal benefits of social housing provision, but the nature of contemporary policy decision-making means that political will remains an important factor in investment decisions. The development of public infrastructure appraisal methods such as CBA can be understood as a consequence of long-term infrastructure investment creating a demand for improvements in assessment and increased analytical capacity in the public and private sector, in the context of competition for funding. This indicates a degree of circularity: ongoing funding to support sector expansion is important in promoting economic analysis in the social housing sector, which is also seen as a step towards increasing industry funding. There is a presumed association between infrastructure provision and economic productivity within appraisal processes and infrastructure agency remits. This relationship is recognised by public servants and representatives from the social housing sector, indicating that infrastructure conceptualisations may not be appropriate for arguing for housing as a welfare intervention, but more apt for proposals that generate employment outcomes, such as key-worker housing. Therefore, the pertinent question is not whether social housing is infrastructure, but whether such a conceptualisation is the best standpoint from which to found advocacy for increased social housing investment. The answer to this question depends on the purpose of the intervention. The resources required to develop appraisal methodologies and analytical capacities underscore the importance of choosing an appropriate basis for further development of social housing business case methodologies. Alternatives to conventional infrastructure CBA methodologies include: avoided costs financial appraisal; a public welfare conceptualisation; and the proposition that the whole of society values providing for those in need. These examples provide a stronger conceptual link to the welfare focus of the social housing. It is also possible that adopting social housing as infrastructure as a central argument for business cases may risk diverting funding to new areas of intervention, rather than increasing funding for providing housing for those most in need."
"Selection and survival in the field of cultural production: a longitudinal study of the Australian census Cultural Economy; Freelancer; Art Research on work in the Creative and Cultural Industries (CCI) often combines macro-level accounts of political economy with small-scale studies, often qualitative, of work in specific organisations and/or sectors. While rich in both the theory and qualitative detail of creative labour, and especially useful for the study of precarious and informal work, such studies cannot capture population movements within cultural employment over time, nor the factors associated with continuing employment. The Australian Census Longitudinal Dataset (ACLD) provides a unique opportunity to track a national sample of workers in a broad range of cultural occupations across two waves of the Australian census, 2006 and 2016. This provides an opportunity to consider the factors associated with both selection into, and continuity within, cultural production employment. The study of factors associated with primary employment in cultural occupations is significant, as such positions are a relatively privileged resource within a broader field characterised by temporary and informal work arrangements, including casual, contract and unpaid work, that are not captured in the Census. The question of who holds these positions is a question of social distribution. We examine the key factors such as gender, age, qualifications, geography and household dynamics, to compare their relative importance in determining the employment and continuity of work in the field of cultural production."
"Longitudinal analysis of subtype C envelope tropism for memory CD4+T cell subsets over the first 3 years of untreated HIV-1 infection Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Tropisms; HIV-1 Background: HIV-1 infects a wide range of CD4+ T cells with different phenotypic properties and differing expression levels of entry coreceptors. We sought to determine the viral tropism of subtype C (C-HIV) Envelope (Env) clones for different CD4+ T cell subsets and whether tropism changes during acute to chronic disease progression. HIV-1 envs were amplified from the plasma of five C-HIV infected women from three untreated time points; less than 2 months, 1-year and 3-years post-infection. Pseudoviruses were generated from Env clones, phenotyped for coreceptor usage and CD4+ T cell subset tropism was measured by flow cytometry. Results: A total of 50 C-HIV envs were cloned and screened for functionality in pseudovirus infection assays. Phylogenetic and variable region characteristic analysis demonstrated evolution in envs between time points. We found 45 pseudoviruses were functional and all used CCR5 to mediate entry into NP2/CD4/CCR5 cells. In vitro infection assays showed transitional memory (TM) and effector memory (EM) CD4+ T cells were more frequently infected (median: 46% and 25% of total infected CD4+ T cells respectively) than naÃ¯ve, stem cell memory, central memory and terminally differentiated cells. This was not due to these subsets contributing a higher proportion of the CD4+ T cell pool, rather these subsets were more susceptible to infection (median: 5.38% EM and 2.15% TM cells infected), consistent with heightened CCR5 expression on EM and TM cells. No inter- or intra-participant changes in CD4+ T cell subset tropism were observed across the three-time points. Conclusions: CD4+ T cell subsets that express more CCR5 were more susceptible to infection with C-HIV Envs, suggesting that these may be the major cellular targets during the first 3 years of infection. Moreover, we found that viral tropism for different CD4+ T cell subsets in vitro did not change between Envs cloned from acute to chronic disease stages. Finally, central memory, naÃ¯ve and stem cell memory CD4+ T cell subsets were susceptible to infection, albeit inefficiently by Envs from all time-points, suggesting that direct infection of these cells may help establish the latent reservoir early in infection."
"Recognising the value of urban runoff and reclaimed water for cultural flows in melbourne: implementation through the planning scheme Indigenous Population; Aboriginal; Canada In Australia, contestation over the use of water resources remains fierce and these contests extends into regional cities and urban capitals. The 2008 Echuca Declaration by the Murray Lower Darling Indigenous Nations called for a share of these water entitlements to be legally and beneficially owned by First Nations with an associated right to use such resources for economic liberation â€“ termed as â€˜Cultural Flowsâ€™. This was necessary because of the inadequacies First Nations of the Murrayâ€“Darling Basin encountered when seeking legal recognition of their cultural rights to water; but as the literature has shown these difficulties are not unique to just First Nations of the Murrayâ€“Darling Basin. Similar problems confront First Nations throughout Australia, especially so in urban Australia. There is limited research into how Cultural Flows can be procured in cities, or how recycled water and treated urban stormwater runoff might have a part to play in the achievement of cultural water management objectives set by Indigenous communities. Centred on the Victorian planning scheme, this research aims to bridge this gap through a policy analysis of recycled water and urban stormwater runoff governance. From here, how this approach might be implemented is discussed.â€™."
"Co-opting and resisting market based instruments for private land conservation Payments For Ecosystem Services; Payment; China The increasing popularity of private land conservation (PLC) globally has quickly translated into an array of polices and programs aimed at achieving ecological benefits. The growth of PLC is entwined with the rise of neoliberal governance, with private land proving congruous with the promotion of market-based instruments (MBIs) and the reliance on private protected areas for conservation in lieu of government investment in public lands. Despite a growing literature on the implications of neoliberal environmental governance, there remains a need for specific insights into the way that individual landholders and ecologies can co-opt or resist the rationalities of MBIs in the practice of private land conservation. Through semi-structured interviews and property walks with 18 landholders, this research examines the implementation of a reverse-auction tender scheme called â€˜EcoTenderâ€™ in Victoria, Australia. We uncovered four main tensions between the market logic of the program and conservation practice: 1) some landholders used the payment scheme to increase regulatory protections on their property through covenants/easements; 2) many landholders struggled to conceive of their stewardship practice as contractual labour; 3) landholders were producing novel ecosystems that challenged land management focused at the property parcel scale when EcoTender encouraged a return to historical benchmark ecologies, and; 4) many landholders wanted social collaboration when the program required competition for cost efficiency. Our insights show that PLC must create room for a diverse trajectory of conservation practice in dynamic socio-ecological contexts. This means careful reflection on the validity of assumptions underpinning MBIs, the trade-offs that come with applying market logic to conservation and the long-term implications of these instruments for policy and practice."
"Five lessons to guide more effective biodiversity conservation message framing Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Climate Change; Skepticism Communication and advocacy approaches that influence attitudes and behaviors are key to addressing conservation problems, and the way an issue is framed can affect how people view, judge, and respond to an issue. Responses to conservation interventions can also be influenced by subtle wording changes in statements that may appeal to different values, activate social norms, influence a person's affect or mood, or trigger certain biases, each of which can differently influence the resulting engagement, attitudes, and behavior. We contend that by strategically considering how conservation communications are framed, they can be made more effective with little or no additional cost. Key framing considerations include, emphasizing things that matter to the audience, evoking helpful social norms, reducing psychological distance, leveraging useful biases, and, where practicable, testing messages. These lessons will help communicators think strategically about how to frame messages for greater effect."
"Nano-plastics and their analytical characterisation and fate in the marine environment: From source to sea Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter Polymer contamination is a major pollutant in all waterways and a significant concern of the 21st Century, gaining extensive research, media, and public attention. The polymer pollution problem is so vast; plastics are now observed in some of the Earth's most remote regions such as the Mariana trench. These polymers enter the waterways, migrate, breakdown; albeit slowly, and then interact with the environment and the surrounding biodiversity. It is these biodiversity and ecosystem interactions that are causing the most nervousness, where health researchers have demonstrated that plastics have entered the human food chain, also showing that plastics are damaging organisms, animals, and plants. Many researchers have focused on reviewing the macro and micro-forms of these polymer contaminants, demonstrating a lack of scientific data and also a lack of investigation regarding nano-sized polymers. It is these nano-polymers that have the greatest potential to cause the most harm to our oceans, waterways, and wildlife. This review has been especially ruthless in discussing nano-sized polymers, their ability to interact with organisms, and the potential for these nano-polymers to cause environmental damage in the marine environment. This review details the breakdown of macro-, micro-, and nano-polymer contamination, examining the sources, the interactions, and the fates of all of these polymer sizes in the environment. The main focus of this review is to perform a comprehensive examination of the literature of the interaction of nanoplastics with organisms, soils, and waters; followed by the discussion of toxicological issues. A significant focus of the review is also on current analytical characterisation techniques for nanoplastics, which will enable researchers to develop protocols for nanopolymer analysis and enhance understanding of nanoplastics in the marine environment."
"Retrofit of Building Façade Using Precast Sandwich Panel: An Integrated Thermal and Environmental Assessment on BIM-Based LCA Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building The study conducts a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of precast sandwich panels by integrating operational and embodied phases detailing thermal efficiency and environmental impacts. The analytical regression model is developed for climatic diversity and design variables using the energy rating tool FirstRate5 to compare with a conventional brick veneer construction. LCA is performed on the building information modeling (BIM) platform to connect operational energy and express the relative embodied impacts of insulation constituents, compressive strength, reinforcement, and mix design. Monte Carlo simulation shows significant advantages of concrete sandwich panels in reducing operational H/C loads over building service life. LCA reveals a 100 mm thick external precast concrete wall with 50% fly ash reduces CO2 emission and energy demand by 54.7% and 75.9% consecutively against the benchmark. Moreover, it comprises 84.31% of the total building mass, accountable for only 53.27% of total CO2 emission and 27.25% of energy demand, which is comparatively lower than other materials. In the case of selecting lining insulation, a broader benefit is identified for extruded polystyrene (XPS) and expanded polystyrene (EPS) boards due to their relative weight, thickness, and environmental impacts. Representative equations of energy efficiency and impact assessment will assist in adopting sandwich panels for new construction and refurbishment with relative dimensions."
"Experimental BER Performance of Quasi-Circular Array Antenna for OAM Communications Optical Vortex; Vortex; Gaussian Beams Orbital angular momentum (OAM), providing an additional degree of freedom, has attracted much attention for spectral efficiency and its potential in communications. The need for more compact OAM-based communication systems has inspired research into quasi-circular arrays (QCAs) producing quasi-OAM beams. In this letter, a QCA-based communication system prototype is designed to transmit and receive quasi-OAM beams of dominant mode order $l=-1$, over a free-space link at 8.5 GHz. The performance of quasi-OAM beams generated by QCAs is analyzed through bit-error-rate (BER) measurements in a lab setting. The BER results are then analyzed against BER of a conventional OAM circular array and augmented quasi-OAM by a QCA to investigate their performance. Furthermore, the intermode interference is analyzed by adding mode $l=0$. The results indicate the feasibility of a quasi-OAM communication system, and proved to be similar, or better than conventional OAM-based systems, where there is no mode cross-talk. Augmenting OAM modes is also proven to make a quasi-OAM communication link similar to conventional OAM, in the presence of cross-talk."
"Open university of Nepal initiative lessons learned from designing an institution of higher learning Undergraduate Medical Education; Medical Students; COVID-19 A group of Nepali diaspora members, represented by the Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA), started a campaign in 2009 to establish the Open University of Nepal (OUN) in partnership with the government of Nepal. Their motivation was to develop a quality university for the masses by mobilizing local, diaspora, and international collaborators for producing and disseminating knowledge in the public domain. The university was subsequently established in 2017 but it drifted away from many of the original objectives. Most critically, it embraced distance education as its central function while setting aside the aspiration of producing and sharing knowledge under the public domain. As the original proponents of this mission, the authors share their experiences and lessons learned so that other campaigners of similar institution building missions could benefit."
"Effect of alloy composition and laser powder bed fusion parameters on the defect formation and mechanical properties of Inconel 625 Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) The objective of this study is to determine the effects of laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) processing parameters and alloy composition on defect formation and mechanical properties of Inconel 625 (IN625). The effects of laser power and scan speed on defect formation were evaluated for two batches of IN625 powder with slightly different compositions. Cracks were observed in all processing conditions for the powder with higher levels of Si and Nb, but not in any condition for the powder with lower Si and Nb. The elimination of cracks through composition changes led to an improvement in all tensile properties, most notably an increase in elongation from 32% to 39â€“48%. The effect of composition on cracking was confirmed using solidification simulations for each alloy and a numerical cracking index. Porosity was found to have a non-linear relationship with the laser scan speed for both powder batches, with large pores forming for excessively high and low speeds, due to lack of fusion and unstable melt pools, respectively. Nevertheless, samples with relative densities exceeding 99.8% were produced through the selection of suitable values for laser power and scan speed. It is concluded that porosity in IN625 is sensitive to the selection of processing parameters, while composition changes within the nominal ranges for IN625 can significantly alter the crack susceptibility of the material."
"Energy poverty and public health: Global evidence Energy; Energy Poverty; Fuelwood The impacts of energy poverty on a range of development goals have been widely examined in the literature; however, how energy poverty affects public health has yet to be studied. Using annual data for a broad panel of 175 countries over the period 2000 to 2018, this paper investigates the effect of energy poverty on public health. To identify the causal effect of energy poverty on public health and tackle the issue of endogeneity, we rely on Oster's (2019) bound analysis and the system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation. Our results show that energy poverty has a detrimental effect on public health. We also find that living standards can serve as a channel through which energy poverty influences health, and that countries with higher standards of living weaken the negative effect of energy poverty on public health. Our results are robust across various specifications and measures of health indicators. Our findings have important implications for policies in public health and transitions to renewable energy."
"Beyond body weight: Design and validation of psycho-behavioural living and eating for health segments (lehs) profiles for social marketing Contemplation; Transtheoretical Model; Processes of Change Obesity, sedentary behaviour, and poor dietary habits amongst young adults are growing concerns, with this age group being in a worse state of health and nutrition than adolescents and adults. This paper presents the procedures for establishing a new instrument for defining behaviours in relation to healthy lifestyle and food choices amongst young adults (Living and Eating for Health Segments: LEHS). The aim of this paper is to outline the instrument design protocol for external validation and to permit replication in other studies. The instrument design process used a multi-step social marketing instrument design method. This approach has previously been used in designing valid and reliable measures in marketing and consumer research, including social marketing. The protocol established six psycho-behavioural LEHS profiles for young adults. These profiles are: Lifestyle Mavens (15.4%), Aspirational Healthy Eaters (27.5%), Balanced-all Rounders (21.4%), Health Conscious (21.1%), Contemplating Another Day (11.2%), and Blissfully Unconcerned (3.4%). Each of these profiles provided insights into psycho-behavioural characteristics that can be used in designing apposite social media social marketing campaigns."
"Energy poverty and obesity Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Obesity is a major health concern in both developed and developing nations. Yet, evidence on the determinants of obesity is relatively limited. We contribute to the literature on the determinants of obesity by empirically examining the effects of energy poverty on obesity. Using 14 waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, we find energy poverty is positively associated with obesity. Applying linear probability model, our estimates suggest that being energy poor results between 1.4 and 2.5 percentage points increase in the probability of being obese, depending on how energy poverty is measured. Our results are robust to alternative modelling techniques, inclusion of additional control variables and potential influence of unobservable. We also find that amount of sleep, health status and level of psychological distress are important transmission channels through which energy poverty influences the probability of being obese."
"How are gender inequality and violence against women related? Findings from a population-level community attitudes survey Child Care; Time Use; Domestic Division of Labour Low support for gender equality (GE) predicts attitudes supporting violence against women (VAW). However, little is known about the influence of attitudes toward different manifestations of GE. This study extends knowledge by assessing the relative strength of attitudes to GE across seven theoretically derived dimensions, and their association with attitudes toward VAW. 17,542 Australians participated in the 2017 National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women Survey. Population means were calculated for the following scales formed from survey questions: the Community Attitudes Supportive of Violence Against Women Scale (CASVAWS), the Gender Equality Attitudes Scale (GEAS) and measures within the GEAS representing the theoretical dimensions. There was variation in support for GE between the measures. The lower the support for GE, the higher the support for VAW. Although all GEAS measures included in regression modelling contributed to variance in the CASVAWS, two accounted for more than half. The study suggests benefits in using a multidimensional model of GE to mitigate cultural support for VAW, with emphasis on the private sphere and countering hostility toward women and rigid gender roles and identities."
"Attitudinal support for violence against women: What a population-level survey of the Australian community can and cannot tell us Intimate Partner Violence; Violence Against Women; Domestic Violence Violence against women (VAW) is a serious and prevalent problem globally. Societal-level norms, practices and structures are among the factors contributing to it, sometimes referred to collectively as representing â€œcultures of supportâ€ for VAW. Understanding factors contributing to these cultures is important for prevention, but remains the subject of debate. Population-level surveys of attitudes toward VAW are one means to strengthen this understanding. Although there are a number of such surveys internationally, scholarly research based on secondary analysis of data, at least from surveys in high-income countries, is scant. This article reports on new analyses of the Australian National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women survey to explore its potential to further empirical and conceptual understanding of cultures of support for VAW. To facilitate this, a scale to measure attitudes toward VAW was developed post hoc from the survey (the Violence Supportive Attitudes, or VSA-18, Scale). Subsequent analyses investigate the relationship between this scale and relevant demographic factors and a measure of attitudinal support for gender equality (GE). The GE measure, place of birth, employment and occupation, generation, education and sex contribute to variance in the VSA-18 Scale. Findings are discussed in the context of theoretical debates and directions for future research."
"Symbiopolitics, Sustainability, and Science Studies: How to Engage With Alien Oceans Sustainability; Louis Althusser; Anthropocentrism This essay explores the implications for inquiries in sustainability education of Helmreichâ€™s discussions of how human biocultural practices scramble nature and culture, life forms and forms of life, and his ethos of acceptance of ambiguous boundaries and transformative linkages with others. The silences in Helmreichâ€™s arguments around gender and sustainability through looking at Probyn and Merchant, and the possibilities for a more-than-human scientific inquiry curriculum, are discussed, as is how science studies offer an image of a more-than-human anthropology that leads us to reconceive evolution, nature, gender, and sustainability, to which educational researchers need to pay attention."
"Molecular docking and network connections of active compounds from the classical herbal formula Ding Chuan Tang Drug Repositioning; Polypharmacology; Bioinformatics Background: Ding Chuan Tang (DCT), a traditional Chinese herbal formula, has been consistently prescribed for the therapeutic management of wheezing and asthma-related indications since the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD). This study aimed to identify molecular network pharmacology connections to understand the biological asthma-linked mechanisms of action of DCT and potentially identify novel avenues for asthma drug development. Methods: Employing molecular docking (AutoDock Vina) and computational analysis (Cytoscape 3.6.0) strategies for DCT compounds permitted examination of docking connections for proteins that were targets of DCT compounds and asthma genes. These identified protein targets were further analyzed to establish and interpret network connections associated with asthma disease pathways. Results: A total of 396 DCT compounds and 234 asthma genes were identified through database search. Computational molecular docking of DCT compounds identified five proteins (ESR1, KDR, LTA4H, PDE4D and PPARG) mutually targeted by asthma genes and DCT compounds and 155 docking connections associated with cellular pathways involved in the biological mechanisms of asthma. Conclusions: DCT compounds directly target biological pathways connected with the pathogenesis of asthma including inflammatory and metabolic signaling pathways."
"Extraction of strategically important elements from brines: Constraints and opportunities Spodumene; Adsorption; Brines Strategically important elements are those that are vital to advanced manufacturing, low carbon technologies and other growing industries. Ongoing depletion and supply risks to these elements are a critical concern, and thus, recovery of these elements from low-grade ores and brines has generated significant interest worldwide. Among the strategically important elements, this paper focuses on rare earth elements (REEs), the platinum-group metals and lithium due to their wide application in the advanced industrial economics. We critically review the current methods such as precipitation, ion exchange and solvent extraction for extracting these elements from low-grade ores and brines and provide insight into the technical challenges to the practical realisation of metal extraction from these low-grade sources. The challenges include the low concentration of the target elements in brines and inadequate selectivity of the existing methods. This review also critically analyzes the potential applicability of an integrated clean water production and metal extraction process based on conventional pressure-driven membrane and emerging membrane technologies (e.g., membrane distillation). Such a process can first enrich the strategically important elements in solution for their subsequent recovery along with clean water production."
"Is transport poverty socially or environmentally driven? Comparing the travel behaviours of two low-income populations living in central and peripheral locations in the same city Public Transport; Accessibility; Transit The paper presents a study to explore the relationship between travel poverty and social disadvantage at the local geographical level. The main aim of the research was to identify the extent to which the revealed travel behavioural outcomes of the study participants are due to personal social constraints or environmental conditions in their residential locations. Specifically, we sought to identify if the greater access to local amenities and public transport services of inner city residents led to an increase in their daily travel activities when compared with their urban peripheral counterparts. The research analysed data from a personal travel survey and one-day travel diary with 502 adults aged between 16 and 65 years in two different deprived areas in Merseyside, North West England. Our analysis is somewhat hampered by the small sample size, but the modelled results suggest that more trips, and longer journey distances do not necessarily imply greater social inclusion. The geographically weighted regression models (GWR) highlighted that the physical location of where people live within the city is more influential on their trip-making patterns than social determinants such as household income, age, gender, and/or employment status. Street connectivity, the level of bus services and neighbourhood safety were all particularly significant for determining spatial variations in the daily trips that were undertaken, with more trips being undertaken where there was a greater density of street nodes, bus stops and where people felt safer at night. This highlights the need for local transport and urban policymakers to carefully consider and target these micro-scale factors when attempting to introduce transport interventions to reduce social exclusion amongst low-income urban populations."
"Regulatory Constraints on Public Sector Innovation: A Case Study on Queensland's Independent Public School Program Education; Land Information System; Informatician Innovation is essential to the improvement of public sector services, yet restrictive regulations may constrain this process. This paper draws on the school autonomy literature to advance our understanding of the effect of regulatory constraints on public sector innovation, using Queensland's Independent Public Schools (IPS) program as a case study and example of regulatory change. The IPS program commenced operation in 2013. Schools are accepted into the program through an expression of interest application. Application forms require individual schools to outline the â€˜innovative educational programs or practicesâ€™ the school will be able to implement if it is accepted as an IPS (Innovation Question). A textual content analysis was undertaken of the Innovation Question for a total of 127 successful applications in the 2013, 2014 and 2015 rounds. Coding was developed based on the Schumpeterian forms of innovation. Overall the results show that the Queensland IPS initiative will foster innovation according to principal's perceptions about the innovative practices that they will be able to implement as an IPS. The paper finds that the current centralised service delivery model is constraining innovation with respect to staffing flexibility, school partnerships, leasing and licensing of facilities and in managing school buildings, facilities and infrastructure."
"DIRECT, a tool for change: Co-designing resource efficiency in the food supply chain Food Loss; Waste Prevention; Community Participation The problem of food waste has captured global attention in recent times. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) estimates that around one-third of the edible parts of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally; equivalent to 1.3 billion ton each year. This paper investigates a newly developed tool to help support better resource management for food manufacturers in dealing with the food waste issues. Our primary contribution lies in our dissection of the participatory nature of the tool development i.e. how do we engage the industries involved for the best social, environmental and economic outcomes? We use a case study method, drawing on data deriving from the various food manufacturing organisations and research partners involved in the development and use of the Dynamic Industry Resource Efficiency Calculation Tool (DIRECT). Through this approach a deep understanding of people and processes involved with the tool development is established, by a â€˜triangulationâ€™ of multiple data from a number of project contexts to develop our insights. We conclude by revealing the establishment of new food manufacturing projects for DIRECT, in terms of what the recent commissioners of said projects identify as the value the tool and process provide, and what that might mean for better food waste outcomes in the future. This validates utilising a co-design approach demonstrated in our paper, and justifies further research into broadening the adoption of such methods in addressing food waste."
"SLM lattice thermal fields acquired by wide-field thermal camera Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Selective laser melting (SLM) enables the fabrication of complex geometries, however the existing literature provides little experimental data on the effect of geometric complexity, such as lattice structures, on the in-situ temperature field. This research applies a wide-field thermal camera to acquire in-situ temperature data for complex Ti64 SLM lattice structures. This novel data enables fundamental insight into how topology affects thermal flow within SLM lattice structures. Specific findings are presented for temperature field and associated lateral cooling rates as a function of lattice topology and local geometry. This data provides fundamental insight into SLM thermal fields and can be used to validate numerical simulations."
"A historical review of the rise of tax effect accounting as a financial reporting norm Deferred Taxes; LIFO; Disclosure This paper deals with one of the most long standing and contentious aspects of company financial reporting: tax effect accounting (TEA). The TEA â€œlife cycle,â€ its transition from a noveltyâ€”emerging as what â€œoughtâ€ to happen due to the â€œissueâ€ of a newly introduced and problematic corporate taxâ€”to a taken for granted norm in contemporary accounting practice, is explored through a constructivist lens. This investigation reveals that a bundle of factors contributed to the normâ€™s legitimization, not simply the normative theory that TEAâ€™s â€œnormalising effectâ€ improves the usefulness of financial reports by â€œcorrectingâ€ misleading and â€œunrealâ€ fluctuations in income tax. Once established, the profession can become â€œcaptiveâ€ by such history. This paper further illuminates TEAâ€™s more recent re-orientation to the balance sheet approach as being consistent with a new emergent norm. This signals incongruence with being purported as a â€œmore completeâ€ reflection, given such a shift can be characterized as a secondary norm with a differentiated purpose."
"Recovery of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium following reoxygenation of sediments from a periodically hypoxic temperate lagoon Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidation; Nitrate Reduction; Sediment Eutrophication and stratification events have increased the incidences of hypoxia and anoxia in coastal environments. The depletion of oxygen in these environments can lead to a shift in biogeochemical processes such as denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). The balance between denitrification and DNRA is critical because denitrification leads to a loss of bioavailable nitrogen and DNRA maintains it within the system. This study examined the effects of reoxygenation on denitrification and DNRA in sediments collected from a periodically hypoxic system (Gippsland Lakes, Australia) and subjected to experimental hypoxia using a modified 15N-isotope pairing technique. For freshly collected sediments, the ratio of denitrification : DNRA was generally < 1 indicating a dominance of DNRA. After 3â€“4 weeks of oxygenation, denitrification increased relative to DNRA resulting in a denitrification : DNRA ratio > 1. Profiles of 15N-N2 and (Formula presented.) accumulation in these experiments showed denitrification and DNRA generally only took place in the surface ~ 2 cm of sediment. Prolonged experiments with reoxygenated sediments showed a decrease in the denitrification : DNRA to < 1 after 56 d coincident with deep accumulation of (Formula presented.) within the sediment (2â€“5 cm) suggesting faunal irrigation enhanced DNRA deep in the sediment. An experiment with bromide tracer confirmed the occurrence of DNRA deep within the sediment at 2â€“6 cm was coincident with tracer penetration, and there was a significant positive relationship between bioirrigation and DNRA. We suggest DNRA deep within the sediment was enhanced by increased availability of organic carbon, reduced solutes, and possibly exposure of reworked sediment to (Formula presented.)."
"Equal Tax for Equal Alcohol? Beverage Types and Antisocial and Unlawful Behaviours* Alcohol Policy; Unit Pricing; Alcohol Drinking Alcohol taxation is an important policy instrument for correcting for market failures associated with excessive alcohol consumption. This paper examines the beverage-specific negative externalities by providing empirical evidence linking ten alcoholic beverage types to drink-driving and hazardous, disturbing or abusive behaviours when intoxicated, using data from six waves of an Australian recreational drug survey. We find that regular-strength beer and pre-mixed spirits in a can rank the highest in their links to negative behaviours, followed by mid-strength beer, cask wine, and bottled spirits. Conversely, drinking low-strength beer or fortified wine reduces the probability of these risky and unlawful behaviours. Bottled wine is shown to be associated with an elevated chance of drink-driving but a reduced chance of other negative behaviours. In contrast to the existing volumetric tax rates for per litre of alcohol, of all harmful beverage types, cask wine appears to be significantly undertaxed relative to its external costs to society. We also note that regular- and mid-strength beer are comparable to pre-mixed drinks in terms of external costs, and yet there is a significant disparity across their tax rates."
"Understanding opportunities for social impact investment in the development of affordable housing Social Housing; Tenants; Homelessness Key findings This is the first study examining the opportunities for, barriers to, and risks for SII in the development of affordable housing in Australia. It considers both social housing and affordable housing supply. Social impact investment (SII) SIIs are those that intentionally target specific social objectives along with a financial return and measure the achievement of both (SIIT 2014a: 2). SII funds can be placed directly by investors or through intermediaries who specialise (sometimes exclusively) in placing SII funds. Intermediaries often, but not always, pool funds. Intermediaries take responsibility for measuring and reporting of impact. The return expectations and assets classes can differ: investors willing to accept concessionary returns (i.e. a below market return) are considered 'impact-first' investors while those requiring non-concessionary returns equal or near equal to market are considered to be 'finance-first' investors (Brest and Born 2013). Deals can be complex, involving other SI investors, concessionary and non-concessionary investment, non-SI investors and philanthropic and other grants. Such deals are termed 'layered' investments. Investment can involve debt, equity or both. The SI investors Westpac Banking Corporation, Community Sector Banking and Bank Australia are the largest SI investors in social and affordable housing in Australia, by virtue of lending to CHPs. Westpac has $1.05 billion invested in the CHP sector (Westpac 2016). Total bank SII in the CHP sector is possibly as much as $1.5 billion at present. This investment is all debt investment. Returns are non-concessionary. Historically, access to capital has been difficult for CHPs and investment has required reconsideration of risk and a shift in credit assessment. This change may or may not have been led by SI investors (further research would be required to answer this question). The participation of bank SI investors however adds competition ensuring all CHPs gain more competitively priced capital and more suitable conditions on finance. Given the concentration of the Australian banking sector (Bryant 2012) this competition is important. This bank SII therefore could be said to be providing 'additionality'. A far smaller $20 million is invested in housing models outside of the registered CHP sector, by non-bank SI investors. These include the Lord Mayors Charitable Foundation (LMCF) who provided $3 million to the Affordable Housing Loan Fund (AHLF), small superannuation funds, high net worth individuals (HNWI), other individuals, philanthropy, self-managed superannuation funds (SMSF), and not-for-profit (NFP) organisations. This $20 million is equal parts debt and equity investment. The equity investors in these models were the only investors to accept concessionary returns. They were supporting innovative models that have the potential for systemic change rather than simply providing housing. Intermediaries Three intermediaries, Foresters Community Finance (FCF), Social Enterprise Finance Australia (SEFA) and Social Ventures Australia (SVA) are currently responsible for the placement of the majority of non-bank SII in social/affordable housing in Australia. These intermediaries have attracted funds from HNWI, NAB, Triodos Bank, Community Sector Banking, Christian Super, HESTA, and the NSW Aboriginal Land Council. These intermediaries are highly respected. All three funds were established following an Australian Government initiative, the Social Enterprise Development and Investment Funds (SEDIFs) that provided $20 million in matched funding. Christian Super recently established its own intermediary, Bright Light. Demand side for investment CHPs are the largest source of demand for funds and represent the only established system of social and affordable housing provision that comprises an at-scale opportunity for expanded SII, which meets the requirements for verifiable impact over time. The opportunity for SII is limited however by CHP sector constraints (issues well documented, see Milligan, Hulse, et al. 2013; Milligan, Pawson et al. 2017) including limited free cash flow (to support borrowings), uncertain tenant housing assistance and income support, and reduced discretion over tenant allocation. Government policy change is viewed as a key source of risk affecting investment (current and future). Two other models were able to access mainstream finance but were not part of the CHP sector. There were a number of organisations currently outside the CHP sector unable to access mainstream lending. These projects span income cohorts-from households eligible for public housing to middle income households-and provide both rental and home ownership opportunities. These non-CHP models expressed dissatisfaction with the existing CHP model and with market provision. A new SII typology SII in Australia does not fit the simple impact-first versus finance-first investment typology found in the literature. Investor reconceptualisation of risk and modification of lending practices occurred in addition to consideration of return requirements. This was not a case of accepting greater risk but rather of reviewing the generally accepted credit assessment practice. Figure 1 describes this new Australian SII typology, which adds whether the investor adopted an orthodox or 'reformed' approach to credit assessment in addition to their approach to returns. Using this new typology, we find that most SII in Australia can be described as partial finance-first, reflecting a combination of non-concessionary returns and modified investment parameters. A far smaller proportion of SII is full impact-first, in that concessionary returns were acceptable and investment parameters were modified. We found no fully finance-first or partial impact-first investment. Barriers and opportunities The CHP sector is the target of most SII, and most existing and potential SI investors wish to see the sector greatly expanded. Government capital grants are regarded as necessary to grow the sector and enable SII at a greater scale. Investment is currently constrained by the lack of CHP free cash flow, rather than lack of collateral required for security. Adverse changes to welfare and housing assistance, and government policy restricting housing allocations to the highest priority applicants on public housing waiting lists were identified as affecting CHP cash flow and as such presenting a risk to investment. Policy development options SII in social and affordable housing reflects government investment. As private investment, there is an expectation of returns on investment. Investment therefore only occurs when the housing organisation is able to generate a positive cash flow to support debt repayment or disbursements to equity holders. This requires the gap between tenant's capacity to pay and the cost of housing provision to be funded by government. The funding of this gap provides an implicit government guarantee. In the Australian context, this requires: â€¢ An annual funding stream for CHPs to close the gap between rental revenues and cost of provision. â€¢ State and territory governments to permit CHPs discretion in who they house so that investor confidence can be maintained (in the absence of a funding stream to meet the gap between rental revenues and cost of provision). â€¢ An annual capital grants program for CHPs to grow the sector. â€¢ Growth of the sector to create the conditions for bond financing-bonds lower the cost of capital and provide for long tenure debt. â€¢ Welfare entitlements and housing assistance to provide sufficient income to all household types to ensure the most vulnerable households will be attractive to house. Social security entitlements need to be stable in order to provide confidence to investors regarding their existing investments as well as future investments. Housing supply bonds were viewed as a key opportunity for reducing the cost of capital and enabling long tenure debt. Land is a critical issue affecting affordability of housing and access to employment and services by vulnerable households. â€¢ Government are frequently owners of well-located land that is surplus to their requirements. Governments could grant such surplus government land to CHPs (as is envisaged by part 21(k) of the National Affordable Housing Agreement (NAHA)). â€¢ Inclusionary zoning could be implemented to provide a new source of social and affordable housing on existing redevelopment sites. Inclusionary zoning would provide the opportunity for layered investment models, common in the US. â€¢ Governments could consider capturing the uplift in value when re-zoning land, through making part of rezoned sites available to CHPs or other NFP housing providers. SII in new home ownership models is able to generate affordable housing supply for both low-income and intermediate income cohorts. The growth of some of these models could be assisted through: â€¢ Government guarantees to permit debt financing and negate the need for substantial equity contributions. â€¢ Revolving funds to provide equity to development projects. The equity would be returned once mortgage loans are issued. The market price of housing for purchase is affected by many factors. However, there has been little scrutiny of the development process and particularly of multi-unit residential development. Profit margins in this sector are high, suggesting competition is less effective than it could be. There is a need for policy-makers to gain a detailed understanding of residential property development and possible industry reforms to improve efficiency. SII would be assisted by: â€¢ As fiduciary duties of superannuation fund managers appear to be open to interpretation, government could review this aspect of superannuation fund management to provide legal clarity for concessionary SII. The study This report presents findings from a research project conducted as part of a broader AHURI Inquiry into social impact investment for housing and homelessness outcomes (Muir, Findlay et al. forthcoming). The purpose of this research is to investigate what contribution SII can make to increasing the supply of affordable housing through providing a detailed analysis of: i) SII in affordable housing internationally and in Australia, ii) opportunities and risks for SII in Australia, iii) barriers to investment, iv) potential for innovation and v) measures government and other parties can take to encourage investment. To date there has been no review of SII in the development of social and affordable housing in Australia. While SII is increasingly of interest in relation to homelessness and housing vulnerability, its application to housing supply has not attracted the same kind of policy attention, despite international and Australian examples. Little therefore is known of investments, the quantum of investment, who the investors are, their motivations or the impact arising from their investment. The registered CHP sector is often presumed to constitute the demand for SII funds. Intermediaries have been established, and many are keen to funnel SII into housing. Much of the advocacy for SII has centred on superannuation funds and on housing supply bonds as a means to attract superannuation funds with CHPs. It is a discussion that reflects a deep concern about the lack of affordable housing stock and mounting frustration at the lack of opportunities for investment. In order to appreciate the implications of private investment including SII, in the supply of social and affordable housing it is necessary to understand residential development financing, and specifically project finance. As we will outline however, private investment in social and affordable housing is not a straightforward matter. This research involved: â€¢ a review of national and international literature on SII in affordable housing â€¢ analysis of in-depth interviews with experts in government, and with SI investors and intermediaries, and CHPs about the definition of SII, its purpose in relation to social/affordable housing, how it has been applied and its benefits in regard to the supply of social and affordable housing in Australia."
"The implementation of the goods and services tax in Malaysia: Potential issues perceived by business taxpayers Compliance Costs; Goods and Services; Taxes The implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) in Malaysia on 1 April 2015 was part of the Malaysian governmentâ€™s taxation reforms aimed at improving the collection of revenue and reducing the countryâ€™s budget deficit. This study presents some of the major issues and concerns that Malaysian business taxpayers perceived as key challenges in preparing for GST implementation. A survey was conducted April to June 2013, in which 426 business taxpayers responded from various small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The results confirmed that, overall, business taxpayers were poorly prepared for GST implementation, with only 9 per cent claiming to be substantially ready. Around 22 per cent of the respondents stated that they were well equipped with computer systems for GST purposes. Over 25 per cent of eligible potential GST registrants stated that they would not register. Over 74 per cent of respondents felt that GST would place an additional compliance burden on them. Only 24 per cent of respondents were confident that they would get the required help and assistance from the Royal Malaysian Customs Department, the GST tax authority. Additionally, whilst larger businesses confirmed that they were well prepared for GST, smaller businesses experienced greater stress in their preparation. This article concludes with a discussion of policy implications for the Malaysian GST system, particularly those that would alleviate businessesâ€™ compliance burdens."
"Australia as a destination for Latin American doctoral candidates: Four personal reflections Education; Acculturative Stress; Studies Abroad Universities are important drivers for transnational migration to Australia, especially for students who are economically mobile, or who might be seeking to convert a transitory study experience into a more permanent migratory one. The economic growth experienced in a number of Latin American countries in the twenty-first century introduced new cohorts of Latin American students into Australian tertiary education institutions, including some from countries that may have had minimal prior presence in Australia. This includes students working towards research degrees. This article presents the autoethnographic accounts of four doctoral candidates from Latin America studying in Australia. It considers their motivations for undertaking graduate research, and the factors that brought them to choose Australia as a study destination, and the benefits and challenges they have experienced in coming here. While the candidates are all from different research fields, their experiences reveal commonalities around three key themes: opportunity, safe exploration and the role of family in enabling decisions about transnational doctoral education."
"Iron Oxide Nanomaterials for the Removal of Heavy Metals and Dyes From Wastewater Iron Nanoparticle; Dechlorination; Wastewater Treatment The leap-forward discovery of nanomaterials and their wide application in varying industries have attracted researchers to perform a further modification to these nanomaterials to improve their application. Iron-based nanomaterials stand out to be one of the highly efficient nanomaterials because of their vast availability and lower production cost compared to other nanomaterials. The production of these carbon-based nanomaterials is focused on utilizing widely available agricultural and nonagricultural biomass waste because of their lower cost and the production of efficient carbon-based nanomaterials. Iron-based nanomaterials found to have favorable properties such as high surface area, improved membrane properties, smaller particle size, and higher tensile strength. These iron-based nanomaterials are utilized for water and wastewater treatment because of their higher efficiency. The demand for clean water in this era of globalization has been increasing because of growth in the industry sector and in the worldwide population as well. Water treatment methods have been facing challenges to providing clean water because of the increase in operational cost, whereas iron-based nanomaterials provide an efficient alternative method for water treatment. This chapter reviews the application of different types of iron-based nanomaterials for water treatment."
"Public Sector Accountability to Implement Sustainable Development Goals in Sri Lanka: Influence of Traditional and Non-Traditional Donors Decision Making; Social Impact Assessment; Environmental Impact Statements Implementation of Sustainable development Goals (SDGs) for better environmental sustainability in developing countries in Asia has taken centre stage in response to the major environmental and social degradation created through rapid economic development in the region. Further, lack of clarity in environmental accountability of traditional economic developmental activities and internationally funded infrastructure development projects has resulted in reduced water and air quality and imperilled biodiversity. SDG related research in developing country context is limited and the impact of the funding bodies on public sector governance and accountability is scarce. This paper aims to fill this gap by addressing environmental accountability of public sector entities in internationally funded development projects in Sri Lanka, as a fast-developing country in Asia. The results indicate that environmental degradation is a continuing issue in Sri Lanka despite the efforts of traditional donor agencies monitoring and implementing environmental sustainability guidelines and SDG principles in infrastructure projects. The drastic change in the donor landscape experienced in the country with the rise of non-traditional donors and the deficiencies in public sector governance and accountability structures pose a significant threat to attainment of SDGs, including environmental sustainability in Sri Lanka."
"Pyrolysis for plastic waste management: An engineering perspective Plastic Waste; Pyrolysis; Catalyst The pervasion of plastic and the inadequacies of the current plastic waste management processes are the premise of various studies that aimed to find sustainable solutions to the plastic waste issues. Amongst these solutions, plastic pyrolysis is particularly promising due to its commercial maturity and complementarity to mechanical recycling. In this paper, recent studies of plastic pyrolysis are reviewed and scrutinised, with particular attention given to feedstock composition, operating conditions, and catalytic choices. Our systematic review found that the success of plastic pyrolysis is dependent on many inter-related operational factors, such as temperature, residence time, and feedstock characteristics. Thus, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance our understanding of the various interconnected parameters involved in plastic pyrolysis. However, AI capacity must be further improved to incorporate more variables such as contaminants, fluctuating feedstocks, and mixed polymers. Many Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) studies have provided abundant evidence showing that plastic pyrolysis is more environmentally beneficial incineration and landfill. Hence, future LCA studies should shift from a comparative perspective to a more holistic approach where plastic pyrolysis is considered as an integrated part of a sustainable waste management system. The review has also identified that more research efforts should be directed towards catalytic pyrolysis and monomer recovery."
"Smart home technologies in everyday life: do they address key energy challenges in households? Household Energy; Energy; Smart Meters Smart home technologies (SHTs) enable new ways of using and managing energy in the domestic sphere. This paper interrogates their contribution to the ambitious carbon emissions reduction efforts required under the 1.5Â°C mitigation pathway set by the Paris Agreement and their suitability for energy poverty alleviation goals. In contrast to aspirational claims for a â€˜smart utopiaâ€™ of greener, less energy intensive, and more comfortable homes currently present in market and policy discourses, we argue that SHTs may reinforce unsustainable energy consumption patterns in the residential sector, are not easily accessible by vulnerable consumers, and do little to help the â€˜energy poorâ€™ secure adequate and affordable access to energy at home."
"P2P Lending platforms in Malaysia: the awareness among young adults Crowdfunding; Lending; Fintech Background - Since 2016, the Securities Commission (SC) in Malaysia has given licenses to only eleven P2P lending platforms. Such lending platforms are expected to disrupt the lending services of traditional lenders in the coming years. However, being still in their infant stages, it is essential to know the extent to which such platforms are made known to potential investors out there. This study examines the extent to which young adults are aware of Malaysia's eleven P2P lending platforms. Methods - A sample of 65 undergraduate students majoring in finance and accounting was used for this pilot study. An online questionnaire was designed with three main parts: demographic, financial literacy, and P2P lending awareness. Results - Findings show that more than half of respondents in the sample are not aware of P2P lending platforms in Malaysia. Most of the respondents are financially literate to certain degrees. Those aware of their presence underestimated the potentially high level of their default rates and misunderstood that investor would be fully protected by such platforms when a loan default. Conclusions -The study's findings have shed light on the current awareness of P2P lending platforms among Malaysian young adults, potential investors of such platforms in the coming years."
"CS in Schools: Developing a sustainable Coding Programme in Australian Schools Computer Science; Education Computing; Computational Thinking Digital technology is compulsory in schools in most states at most year levels in Australia. However, a recent survey of over 400 Australian schools in 2019 found that 96% have had difficulty hiring qualified technology teachers and 39% of schools have reduced the amount of technology education they offer. We have observed that there is a shortage of teachers who feel qualified to teach coding. To address this problem, we launched CS in Schools (see https://csinschools.com), a successful in-class professional development programme for teachers that helps schools build a robust digital technology capability in their students. Our programme matches pedagogy with content expertise, by matching a volunteer computing professional with a secondary school teacher, and helping that teacher develop their coding skills in the classroom over a six month period. This experience paper describes the approach we took in piloting our programme with 10 teachers inâˆ¼8 schools who taught over 1,100 students in 2019. We also describe our current scale-up in 2020 to work with around 60 teachers, around 40 volunteers, over 25 schools, and more than 6,000 students. Our goal is to work with hundreds of schools in 2021."
"Influence of home/school environments on children's obesity, diet, and physical activity: the SUECO study protocol Obesity; Farmers' Markets; Grocery Stores Objective: The SUECO study examines the relationship between urban obesogenic environments and health outcomes among school-age children in the city of Madrid, Spain. We will study how features of the urban environment (related to the food- and the physical activity environment) associate with children's anthropometrics, eating habits, and physical activity levels. Method: We describe the study protocol of this multilevel study in a representative sample of school-age children in the city of Madrid (2017; n = 5,961 children ages 3-12). Main outcome variables include anthropometrics (body mass index, waist circumference, and body fat), healthy and unhealthy consumption measures, and physical activity measures. The primary explanatory variables are grouped into food environment (e.g., unhealthy food retailersâ€™ density) and physical activity environment (e.g., walkability, physical activity opportunities) variable categories. Multilevel models will be used to calculate the associations between each indicator and obesity and physical inactivity."
"Impact of alginate selection for wastewater treatment by immobilised Chlorella vulgaris Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Rapid nutrient removal from municipal wastewater can be achieved by algae immobilised in beads of alginate. The use of immobilised algae has been limited by the additional costs of immobilisation, hence the selection of an alginate with appropriate properties can improve its viability. Nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) removal, biomass productivity, bead stability, and production cost were criteria used to compare the immobilisation of Chlorella vulgaris in three alginate products: food grade, and two laboratory products with low and medium viscosity. Algal biomass productivity was greater for low viscosity (47 mg/L/d) than both medium viscosity (37 mg/L/d) and food grade (36 mg/L/d) alginate while nutrient removal was independent of alginate product in batch culture. As such, the criteria for alginate selection could be narrowed to bead stability and alginate price. Beads prepared from medium viscosity alginate were the least stable as they lost the most strength over four weeks exposure to wastewater, swelled and released more organic carbon than the other two products. This was attributed to the lower proportion of L-guluronate in the polymer for medium viscosity alginate which led to the Ca-alginate having less cross-linking. Greater cross-linking in the structures of the food and low viscosity Ca-alginates was associated with higher porosity (96.7â€“96.8%) and higher immobilisation efficiency (95â€“97%). As immobilisation in food grade alginate led to similar nutrient removal and little loss of stability in wastewater, despite lower algal growth, its lower cost means it presented as an effective alternative to the laboratory products."
"“Bitch, You Got What You Deserved!”: Violation and Violence in Sex Buyer Reviews of Legal Brothels Prostitution; Sex Workers; Sexual In this article, we use feminist critical discourse analysis to examine online brothel reviews (148 reviews and 2,424 reply posts) of sex buyers in the context of debates surrounding harm minimization. Our findings show that sex buyers actively construct and normalize narratives of sexual violation and violence against women in licensed brothels through their language, referencing objectification, unsafe sex practices, and, in more extreme cases, rape to create a sense of community with other punters. Through this analysis, we challenge existing assumptions about harm minimization in systems of prostitution, which are legalized or fully decriminalized."
"Governments matter for capitalist economies: Regeneration and transition to green and decent jobs Personnel; Enterprise Bargaining; Employer Association Many traditional regions are undergoing change and transformation as industries restructure. The development of â€˜green economiesâ€™ and the transition to a low-carbon economy offers areas experiencing industrial decline an opportunity to innovate around policies for regeneration. In this process, there is a necessary emphasis on skills development and the creation of decent jobs, but institutional context mediates such processes in different places in different ways. This article argues that an effective transition policy is more likely to emerge where a mutually reciprocal relationship is developed between the state qua government and the social groups that comprise the region, including employers and workers and their representatives. Utilising a â€˜varieties of capitalismâ€™ typology in relation to areas of industrial decline in Germany and the UK, the article illustrates the ways in which transition policies are elaborated and implemented, with an explicit focus on decent job creation."
"Engineering properties of geopolymer aggregate concrete Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali This paper reports a novel methodology to manufacture geopolymer coarse aggregate (GPA) using low calcium fly ash. The developed methodology is outlined together with a systematic experimental study undertaken to examine a viable manufacturing process for GPA production and the consideration of key mechanical properties and durability characteristics of GPA concrete up to 90 days. GPA with a dry compressive strength in excess of 50 MPa can be manufactured using a solid cylindrical mould with compression applied using a cylindrical piston. The key mechanical properties investigated for GPA concrete demonstrate a good correlation with the compressive strength to conventional crushed aggregate concrete. Concrete with mean compressive strength up to 37 MPa can be produced using the innovative GPA concrete. The GPA concrete demonstrates low water and air permeability indicating that the material is a high-quality concrete with a dense pore structure. Overall, GPA investigated in this research shows potential as a lightweight coarse aggregate in portland cement concrete, with the significant additional benefit of addressing and reducing the environmental impact of fly ash from coal fired power generation."
"Developing community disaster resilience through preparedness Twitter; Disaster; Event Detection Disasters have the potential to cause great devastation, such as significant human, material and environmental loss. Due to the increase in disaster frequency and impacts, there has been a shift in focus from disaster recovery and response to disaster prevention. Preventative disaster management is essential in reducing and eliminating community disaster risk exposure. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of three past events including the 2011 Queensland floods, the Harrietville Community Emergency Management Plan and the Christchurch and Japan earthquakes. By combining the existing literature, secondary qualitative data analysis, a conceptual model of disaster management has been developed. The findings of this research include; the development of a conceptual model that present new concepts to improve the community resilience capabilities; identification of effective methodologies for developing community resilience; the potential implementation of social media as a preparedness strategy; and discussion on community empowerment and a shared responsibility amongst all agencies."
"Synergistic effects of nanomedicine targeting TNFR2 and DNA demethylation inhibitor— An opportunity for cancer treatment Type II Tumor Necrose Factor Receptor; Adalimumab; Human TNF Protein Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is expressed on some tumor cells, such as myeloma, Hodgkin lymphoma, colon cancer and ovarian cancer, as well as immunosuppressive cells. There is increasingly evidence that TNFR2 expression in cancer microenvironment has significant implications in cancer progression, metastasis and immune evasion. Although nanomedicine has been extensively studied as a carrier of cancer immunotherapeutic agents, no study to date has investigated TNFR2-targeting nanomedicine in cancer treatment. From an epigenetic perspective, previous studies indicate that DNA demethylation might be responsible for high expressions of TNFR2 in cancer models. This perspective review discusses a novel therapeutic strategy based on nanomedicine that has the capacity to target TNFR2 along with inhibition of DNA demethylation. This approach may maximize the anti-cancer potential of nanomedicine-based immunotherapy and, consequently, markedly improve the outcomes of the management of patients with malignancy."
"A method for separation of heavy metal sources in urban groundwater using multiple lines of evidence Brownfield Redevelopment; Brownfields; Contaminated Land Determining sources of heavy metals in soils, sediments and groundwater is important for understanding their fate and transport and mitigating human and environmental exposures. Artificially imported fill, natural sediments and groundwater from 240 ha of reclaimed land at Fishermans Bend in Australia, were analysed for heavy metals and other parameters to determine the relative contributions from different possible sources. Fishermans Bend is Australia's largest urban re-development project, however, complicated land-use history, geology, and multiple contamination sources pose challenges to successful re-development. We developed a method for heavy metal source separation in groundwater using statistical categorisation of the data, analysis of soil leaching values and fill/sediment XRF profiling. The method identified two major sources of heavy metals in groundwater: 1. Point sources from local or up-gradient groundwater contaminated by industrial activities and/or legacy landfills; and 2. contaminated fill, where leaching of Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn was observed. Across the precinct, metals were most commonly sourced from a combination of these sources; however, eight locations indicated at least one metal sourced solely from fill leaching, and 23 locations indicated at least one metal sourced solely from impacted groundwater. Concentrations of heavy metals in groundwater ranged from 0.0001 to 0.003 mg/L (Cd), 0.001â€“0.1 mg/L (Cr), 0.001â€“0.2 mg/L (Cu), 0.001â€“0.5 mg/L (Ni), 0.001â€“0.01 mg/L (Pb), and 0.005â€“1.2 mg/L (Zn). Our method can determine the likely contribution of different metal sources to groundwater, helping inform more detailed contamination assessments and precinct-wide management and remediation strategies. A method for heavy metal source separation in groundwater has been developed for use in large-scale urban re-development settings, to inform contamination assessments, and remediation strategies."
"Climate change impacts on rice-based livelihood vulnerability in the lower Vietnamese Mekong Delta: Empirical evidence from Can Tho City and Tra Vinh Province Mekong River; Dams; Hydropower This paper assesses the livelihood vulnerability and adaptive capacity of rice-based farmers in the lower Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) under the impact of climate change and environmental pressures. We interviewed 600 rice farmers in 19 communes spanning six districts of Can Tho City (middle delta) and Tra Vinh Province (coastal delta). For our analyses, we employed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) framework and the LVI approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (LVIâ€“IPCC). Results indicate that both study areas are vulnerable to climate change and environmental pressures, but the potential threat is greater in the coastal province. Farmers there have responded to climate change and environmental pressures by increasing production inputs, scaling up production areas and transforming cropping patterns, though with little investment in new equipment. Yet, their livelihoods from rice cultivation, and agricultural production in general, remain unsustainable under climate change, which is a matter of concern. This study provides empirical evidence of the vulnerability factors that most undermine farmersâ€™ adaptive capacity and livelihood sustainability in the study areas. This will help local authorities in providing timely support to agricultural production management."
"The Power of Podcasts – sharing stories to transform teaching practices, learning experiences and academic cultures Webcasts; Lectures; Videorecording In a constantly changing Higher Education environment, academic staff are under increasing pressure to improve their teaching practices to enhance the student learning experience. This requires them to engage with the scholarship of learning and teaching â€“ not only do they need to keep abreast of recent educational developments, but also measure the successes of their teaching approaches and share their practice with others. This is no mean feat against a backdrop of increasing workloads and an evolving culture of performance. The growing challenge for Academic Developers is to effectively support staff in their scholarly practice, through the provision of high quality resources and events/sessions. In all cases, the material must be accessible, relevant, inspiring and applied â€“ translating across disciplines, at scale. Yet, too often, we know that resources end up under-used and events suffer chronically poor attendance (Hains-Wesson and Curran, 2014; Woodley, Funk and Curran, 2013). The presentation will describe the process by which a College Academic Development Group (ADG) developed an innovative strategy to reach a wider audience for staff capacity building. Drawing on the literature on informal learning in the workplace (Boud 1999), we sought to use conversational storytelling as a mechanism for sharing, promoting and exploring teaching practices. We noted from the literature that an informal community of practice (CoP) that encouraged teaching staff to innovate and influence change via the sharing of teaching and learning stories among peers is a cost-effective sustainable model that could easily be adopted and promoted through social media such as, podcasts, blog posts, LinkedIn and Twitter micro-blogging on internet enabled devices (Lefoe and Myers, 2006; Hains-Wesson and Curran, 2014; Warr Pedersen, 2016). In February 2019, we launched a podcast series called Open Classrooms. In each episode, a member of staff talks about something new or interesting they are doing in their curriculum or classroom. To date, there have been 14 episodes, each made available as free, open resources via Soundcloud and iTunes, and the series has become establish as one of the Collegeâ€™s flagship Teaching and Learning resources. By capturing and publishing teachersâ€™ stories in podcast format, we have successfully used accessible technology to enhance individualsâ€™ teaching practice, professional profiles and catalyse social and cultural change in academic departments. The presenters will tell the story of Open Classrooms, drawing on audio-visual resources to give the audience a multi-perspective understanding of the project and its impact. We will include a description of the practical approaches we have taken to recruiting interviewees, preparing them for the conversation, recording, publishing and marketing/advertising. Data from our on-going evaluation work will be used to tell our emergent impact story, including formal intended outcomes as well as some of the more surprising benefits to individuals and school cultures. Finally, we will reflect on the experience from our own perspective as academic developers with no previous experience of podcasting."
"Asian contributions to communication for development and social change Acetone Hydrazone; Indonesian Islam; Sharia The debates on the role of media and communications in promoting sustainable development acknowledge the multiple experiments that were undertaken from the 1940s and 1950s as being key to laying the foundations of the field we now call development communication or communication for development. Yet, as has been emphasized over the years, it is the agriculture communication and extension experiments at the University of the Philippines, Los BaÃ±os, that would herald the pioneering contestation of development thinking using media and communication in Asia. Considered together with the Asian Tigersâ€™ approaches toward radical economic development, the Asiaâ€™s schools, institutions, organizations, and governments demonstrated that there was a different way of thinking about and doing development beyond what the western modernist theories and perspectives were proffering. This chapter is a celebration of the Asian contributions to development communication, which was a term employed by the pioneers of the field. Over the years, other terms have come into use, including communication for development and social change. While the emphasis has been placed in the fact that these were pioneering contributions, this chapter examines the specific attributes of such a contribution and how, considered in retrospective, students of society will come to appreciate the fundamental aspects of theory and practice today that trace their origins to these experiments. The chapter highlights seven of these contributions in order to demonstrate the fundamental concerns that drive the agenda, processes, and partnerships in the field. The chapter acknowledges that the field has moved on; there is a growing danger of a growing disregard for history, as if the field just emerged without a historical context. Yet it is this very historicity, in Asia, as much as in Latin America and Africa, that continues to shape the practice on the ground, even in the face of the historical revisionism of modernist development approaches mostly being promoted by international development institutions."
"Challenging the entrepreneurial discourse around women home-based workers’ empowerment Informal Economy; Eurobarometer; Economic Aspect This article explores dominant entrepreneurship discourse and practice surrounding informal women home-based workers, and their relationship to goals of individual empowerment. We argue that conventional neoliberal entrepreneurship discourse conflates empowerment and performativity, linking the capacity of women to develop greater agency with their incorporation into an economic regime with predetermined roles, labelled â€˜empowermentâ€™. Applying a critical lens, we analyse the development discourse on entrepreneurship and economic performativity in these terms â€“ looking to understand the characteristics of empowerment concerning home-based workers in Bangladesh working for a fair-trade organisation and a domestic garment supply chain. We argue that the conflation of empowerment and performativity serves the convenience of neoliberal ideology rather than the empowerment needs of those to whom such discourses are applied. To complement our critique, based on the empowerment literature, we develop a conceptual framework of empowerment and agency encompassing individual and collective agency, considering these in light of the relationship between performativity and social reproduction. Coupling a more nuanced understanding of empowerment to the critique of the entrepreneurial discourse, as applied to women home-based workers, provides a theoretical contribution to the empowerment and entrepreneurial discourse literature.

"The assessment of graduate sustainability attributes in the workplace: Potential advantages of using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) Education For Sustainability; Higher Education Institutions; Sustainable Development Sustainability in higher education aims to educate learners, as both citizens and future professionals, to build capacity to bring about a more sustainable future. As such, sustainability education can be seen as part of enabling work-ready graduates. Many universities, globally, have begun to embed sustainability capabilities into their degree programs. However, there is a gap in existing methods for assessing graduate application of the associated learning outcomes, post degree-completion. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) has been suggested and applied in the development of an assessment tool to address this limitation. The TPB considers human behaviour is influenced by a number of factors, the measurement of which allows one to understand the likelihood of a person executing a particular behaviour. This paper presents an overview and explanation of how TPB could be applied to graduate sustainability capability assessment, thereby, offering insight into how graduate learning is applied in professional settings."
"Gesturing not acting: Searching for policy guidance for Australian climate educators Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Climate Change; Skepticism Australia has no national approach to climate change education, neither for primary, secondary, or tertiary education nor for the informal and community adult education sectors. Inaction has its roots in Australian politics reluctant to engage with scientific evidence or community experience of extreme weather events and hamstrung by the political interference of carbon dealing mega-corporations cashing in on a profit-making bonanza. Adult educators have a substantial role to play in addressing the climate crisis and there is value in considering the international sphere for policy guidance. We conducted a descriptive, desktop content analysis of documents produced under the auspices of the United Nations from 2010 to 2022 searching for future-focussed statements on climate justice education policy. International frameworks and conventions hold concrete possibilities for imaging transformative practices. There are increasing levels of detail in frameworks supportive of climate change education internationally, and Australia is a signatory. Our work contributes towards the argument that Australia needs to develop national and state policy settings for climate justice education in line with United Nations settings."
"Increasing anthropogenic salinisation leads to declines in community diversity, functional diversity and trophic links in mountain streams Macroinvertebrate; Salinization; Salt Lakes Anthropogenic salinisation is becoming an increasing global issue for freshwater ecosystems, leading to serious biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. While the effect of anthropogenic salinisation on freshwater ecosystems has been intensively studied in recent years, most studies focus on salinisation effects on the individual or single groups of organisms without considering the effect on the ecosystem levels, such as diversity and trophic links. Therefore, we conducted a long-term field survey from May 2009 to August 2016 at 405 sites in northeast China to investigate the effect of a gradient of salinisation on community diversity, functional diversity and trophic links in mountain streams. Samples of water chemistry, periphyton, macroinvertebrates and fish were collected. Our results showed that as anthropogenic salinisation increased, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3âˆ’ and SO42âˆ’ exhibited significant increases (p < 0.05). These increased ions caused decreases in taxonomic evenness and biotic integrity, but an increase in the beta diversity for periphyton and macroinvertebrates, and a slight increase in the evenness of fish. The increased salinisation resulted in the extirpation of salt-sensitive taxa and declines in macroinvertebrate functional richness and functional redundancy, which consequently led to simplified trophic links. Our results implied that if salt-tolerant taxa in high salinisation sites were not functionally redundant with less tolerant taxa, alterations of their functional composition probably decrease the stability of ecosystem functions. Overall, our study suggests that the ongoing anthropogenic salinisation is posing serious threats to biodiversity and trophic links in river ecosystems, and should be considered in future river restoration and biodiversity conservation."
"Soil Security for Australia Spatial Autocorrelation; Soil Organic Carbon; Carbon Sinks Soil Security is an emerging sustainability science concept with global application for guiding integrated approaches to land management, while balancing ecosystem services, environmental, social, cultural, and economic imperatives. This discussion paper sets the scene for an Australian Soil Security framework as an example of how it might be developed for any country, defining the key issues and justification for Soil Security, as well as detailing implementation requirements and benefits; two examples of beneficial outcomes are provided in terms of facilitating decommoditization of agricultural products and the impact of urban encroachment on productive land. We highlight research gaps, where new knowledge will contribute to well-rounded approaches that reflect differing stakeholder perspectives. We also provide key nomenclature associated with a potential Soil Security framework so that future discussions may use a common language. Through this work we invite scientific and policy discourse with the aim of developing more informed responses to the myriad of competing demands placed on our soil systems."
"Creep and drying shrinkage of different fly-ash-based geopolymers Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali Fly ash geopolymer concrete is a sustainable green construction material that has outstanding mechanical performance and is a low-energy material with a low carbon footprint. In this study, a detailed investigation of the long-term creep and drying shrinkage of three different 100% fly ash geopolymer concretes was carried out up to 1 year of age. Two geopolymers, produced from Gladstone and Pt. Augusta fly ashes, achieved approximately 700 microstrain at the end of 1 yearâ€”equivalent to the total creep strain displayed by portland cement (PC) concrete. Moreover, both geopolymer concretes displayed a lower creep coefficient than PC concrete. Hence, AS 3600 or the CEB-FIP model could be conservatively used to predict creep coefficient for two geopolymers. However, the Tarong fly ash geopolymer concrete differed significantly from the other geopolymers and achieved approximately 1900 microstrain after 1 year. The drying shrinkage of Gladstone and Pt. Augusta geopolymer concretes at 1 year are 175 and 190 microstrain, respectively, while Tarong geopolymer and PC concrete achieved 615 and 475 microstrain, respectively. All the fly ash geopolymer concrete showed lower drying shrinkage than the maximum permitted value recommended by AS3600. Incorporation of calcium-alumina-silicate-hydrate (C-A-S-H) gel with the sodium-alumina-silicate-hydrate (N-A-S-H) geopolymeric gel was seen to positively affect the packing density of the gel phase. The degree of uniformity and compactness of aluminosilicate gel matrix together with the macroporosity in the 50 nm to 1 Âµm range was identified as determining the long-term creep and drying shrinkage of the 100% low-calcium fly ash geopolymer concrete."
"Dynamics and drivers of per capita CO2 emissions in Asia Income Convergence; Structural Funds; European Union The aim of this paper is to document recent trends in Asia's CO2 emissions and explore the mechanisms that drive those emissions for fourteen countries over the period 1971 to 2017. We apply a sequential method which has a strong relationship to policy indicators. First, an analysis of the dynamics is undertaken to identify if convergence is occurring, followed by a study of the determinants of those dynamics. This approach overcomes some of the limitations of previous work analyzing emission convergence by focusing on country specific characteristics such as energy mix and energy efficiency. The analysis reveals per capita CO2 emissions, energy intensity, carbonization and per capita incomes are slowly converging over the full sample. Yet this behavior is not uniform; there were differences in transition paths prior to and after the Asian Financial Crisis. The per capita income driver was the most important driver in explaining the dynamics and variation of emissions while carbonization and energy intensity drivers were less pronounced. The analysis reveals that the energy needs of the region's extraordinary economic growth favored fossil fuels and a surprising revelation is that despite having different per capita income levels China, Korea, and Vietnam all share a common convergence path. This paper provides further evidence against using carbon intensity solely as a target for climate policy."
"Rewilding policy futures: Maori whakapapa and the ecology of the subject Integrated Assessment Model; Carbon; Global Temperature Increase The world is changing, but political and educational institutions appears to be stuck in the 19th century. Modern policy and education are both premised on an Enlightenment assumption of the human, rational, individual subject. Increasingly, elements of these philosophical premises are being interrogated. The critique emerges from the environmental interest in collapsing the dualism between subject and object, and reintegrating the human with/in our ecological context. Indigenous philosophy is important for rethinking the integration of the dualism between humanity and ecology. Maori philosophy is a vital counterpoint to the anthropomorphic position of modern policy and education. Taking Maori concepts to inform contemporary philosophy generates a substantive shift in world view that does not lose sight of the solipsist, phenomenological parameters of human sense making, but enables us to make deeper ethical decisions, and transform the basis of education and policy."
"Connecting survivors to therapeutic support and criminal justice through informal reporting options: an analysis of sexual violence reports made to a digital reporting tool in Australia Sexual Assault; Rape; Victims This article analyses the content of 483 reports of sexual violence, including rape, sexual assault, child sexual abuse and various forms of sexual harassment, made to a digital reporting tool (DRT) developed by a rape crisis centre in Melbourne, Australia. These written digital reports were made in a confidential and informal capacity, with all de-identified reports distributed to relevant policing jurisdictions to support intelligence gathering. Based on an analysis of the de-identified reports, this article suggests the DRT functioned as an important gateway in connecting survivors with appropriate therapeutic support when disclosing sexual violence and had a demonstrable capacity to provide the police with information for intelligence gathering. There was also scope for survivors to make formal reports should they wish to do so. However, further research with police, sexual violence support services and survivors is needed to develop a full understanding of the potential of informal sexual violence reporting options."
"Internet of Things: The Potentialities for Sustainable Agriculture Internet Of Things; Food Supply Chain; Agricultural Products Internet of Things (IoT) technology has a substantial role to play in promoting sustainable agriculture and food production. SMEs are playing a leading role in this space. Tools that allow continuous monitoring and decision making for example regarding the use of fertilisers or water consumption are being applied in various parts of the world by SMEs as in Vietnam and Australia, to undertake sustainable agriculture and food production. The aim in this article is to provide an overview of the latest technology which has been developed and applied in this space. Through the consideration of examples of applications, the resulting implications and impacts for example relating to water and energy use are provided. The potential for reducing environmental impacts while creating sustainable agriculture and food production from the perspective of technological applications by SMEs is discussed with broader environmental impact considerations."
"Women Entrepreneurship and Sustainable Development: Bibliometric Analysis and Emerging Research Trends Migrant Workers; Self-Employment; Ethnic Business Women entrepreneurship has attracted the attention of academics and practitioners with a large body of research studies in recent years. Past literature reviews on women entrepreneurship have been criticized for their limited scope, lack of interdisciplinary perspective, and the need for more objective, technology-facilitated analytical methods. Our study provides insights into the development of women entrepreneurship research, including a new analysis through the lens of sustainable development and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bibliometric indicators and a systematic literature review approach are used to analyze literature published between 1991 and 2021 to better map the development of research and related opportunities for enhancing studies on women entrepreneurship. In addition to traditional bibliometric indicators such as publications, citations, etc., we used altmetrics, a new metric to assess the engagement and impact of publications based on social media presence. The Dimensions database has been used to assemble and arrange 3157 publications on women entrepreneurship, of which 843 publications are directly aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and 80 publications related to COVID-19. Our findings indicate that the top three SDG of interest to researchers are: SDG 8, decent work and economic growth; SDG 10, reducing inequalities; and SDG 5, gender equality. Within each SDG, we find concentrated studies on themes relating to the socio-political and small-medium enterprises, including family business management and gender biases, and their implications for sustainable development. Further, studies on the impact of COVID-19 reveal a significant bias towards womenâ€™s empowerment in ICT, digitization, and e-commerce while exposing the need for gender-moderated policies and governmental interventions. We offer suggestions for future studies on enabling and measuring the contributions of womenâ€™s entrepreneurship to sustainable development, including capital investments and the long-term impacts of the pandemic on women-led enterprises."
"A review on the bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons: Current state of the art Bioremediation; Bioaugmentation; Contaminated Soil Petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) enter the environment due to exploration, transportation, usage and spills. PHC contamination is of major concern worldwide due to the damage they cause to the environment. Clean up of hydrocarbon-contaminated sites is expensive and time-consuming; however, bioremediation represents a cost-effective and environmentally safe approach to clean up PHC contamination. Many bioremediation strategies can be applied depending on the contaminated site and the surrounding environment. In addition, a variety of technologies are used to assess the efficiency of bioremediation of contaminated environments through analysis of the concentration of the pollutant. Other technologies are applied to study the microbial communities in the contaminated sites since they represent the backbone of any bioremediation process. One of the most convenient technologies in this regard is next-generation sequencing (NGS) since it is cost-effective and provides comprehensive information regarding diversity and therefore bioremediation potential of microbial communities. Bioremediation, however, is not always a straightforward approach, especially when another contaminant (e.g. heavy metals) is associated with PHC. In this chapter, the concept of bioremediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated environments is illustrated. Moreover, the most common technologies applied in bioremediation are explained. In addition, the most recent tools for assessing the microbial ecology are described. Finally, current challenges and limitations of bioremediation are presented."
"Male and female mental health differences in built environment undergraduates Emotional Intelligence; Job Performance; Emotion The construction industry faces skills shortages and growing mental health issues which have stimulated a research focus on the underrepresentation of female employees and on its tough macho-culture and stressful working conditions. Evidence of sex differences in construction workersâ€™ mental health is starting to emerge, with women and younger workers experiencing the greatest levels of distress. This study takes an upstream perspective on construction human resources to explore sex differences in mental health and resilience in the early career pipeline of emerging built environment (BE) professionals. A survey of 384 BE undergraduates was conducted using the DASS-21 measure of mental health and the Resilience at University scale to explore the psychological adjustment of first and final year student cohorts. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, and regression. Compared to first year students, female studentsâ€™ mental health appeared to have deteriorated across the four-year degree, whereas, male studentsâ€™ overall mental health improved. The results suggest that the construction classroom may be operating as a microcosm of the cultural environment faced by women in society in general and in the construction industry with its macho culture filtering back into the university sector. These findings suggest the need for greater attention to sex and gender differences in mental health. It is recommended that construction educators and employers partner together to proactively affect culture change by addressing gender bias early, by consciously creating a female-friendly, inclusive culture which emphasises a sense of belonging, and by providing gender-appropriate support systems and resilience training for emerging construction professionals."
"Gender violence: marketplace violence and symbolic violence in social movements Mental Health; Sexual And Gender Minorities; Sexual Behavior Drawing on a retrospective case study involving LGBTQ populations and the tobacco industry, we demonstrate how a duplicitous stance by Big Tobacco illuminates the ways that symbolic violence is perpetrated on consumers. We define marketplace violence as the actions and narratives of powerful market actors that perpetuate inequalities that less powerful market actors experience. This research delineates how marketplace relationships perpetuate gender and sexual orientation discrimination, and how powerful market actors engage in invidious action under the guise of community support, thereby undermining community-based social movements."
"Fabrication of advance magnetic carbon nano-materials and their potential applications: A review Hydrothermal Carbonization; Hydrochars; Carbon Novel magnetic carbon nano-materials have attracted great interest in recent years due to their potential applications in many areas that exploit the combined advantage of magnetic with nano-scale properties.

"Does bank competition promote financial inclusion? A cross-country evidence Bank Lending Channel; Loans; Credit Rationing The idea of financial inclusion has recently been discussed as one of the key strategies to enhance economic development (World Bank 2014). We move this discussion forward by examining if bank competition is a crucial component enforcing financial inclusion, which is arguably a finance supply-side driven process. In this study, we compute the financial inclusion index built on Sarma (2008) approach to better reflect banksâ€™ willingness and capability to provide financial services. Applying System Generalized Method of Moments to the panel of 93 countries, we find that bank competition promotes financial inclusion."
"Financial inclusion and poverty: Micro-level evidence from Nigeria Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion In this chapter, the authors use data from the 2016 Financial Inclusion Insights (FII) program for Nigeria to present new evidence on the effects of financial inclusion on household poverty. The authors add to the discourse on the association between financial inclusion and poverty by examining alternative approaches to measuring both financial inclusion and poverty. The chapter demonstrates that an increase in multi-dimensional financial inclusion, reflecting access to banks, access to credit and access to insurance, is associated with a decline in poverty. Further analysis by the authors show that among the components of financial inclusion, access to a checking, savings or fixed deposit account is more important than access to credit and insurance in reducing poverty."
"A feminist critical discourse analysis of sexual harassment in the Japanese political and media worlds Political Representation; Quotas; Parliament This article examines sexual harassment that has occurred in the interconnected worlds of media and politics in Japan in the context of the global (mostly Western) #MeToo movement. It argues that this harassment by male political leaders constitutes a pattern of sexual harassment and should not be seen simply as individual incidents that exist in isolation from each other. This pattern occurs within a cultural context that discourages speaking out about individual grievancesâ€”a particularly noxious cultural norm for women in a patriarchal society. The naming of this pattern of sexual harassment is important to address Violence Against Women in Politics, a problem facing women in politics around the world, including Japan. The public and media outrage directed at individual sexist statements made by male politicians often dissipates after some time has passed, only to emerge again after the next sexist incident makes headlines. By establishing this as a pattern of sexual harassment, I aim to make visible the problem of sexual harassment as a systemic problem facing all women working in politics or in close proximity to politicians in Japan."
"R2P and Counter-Terrorism: Where Sovereignties Collide Humanitarian Intervention; First International; Ethnic Cleansing States play the lead role in implementing the norms of the international system. They interpret norms through the lens of their sovereignty, refining and revising them until they are suitable to local interests and context. The complex nature of sovereignty and its diverse manifestations across states means that norms will be interpreted and implemented in different ways. This article argues that R2P and counter-Terrorism are complex norm regimes which are susceptible to modification as they are interpreted through diverse conceptions of state sovereignty. Using the cases of China's response to the Uyghurs and Sri Lanka's response to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, this article shows that the malleable prescriptive norms of R2P and counter-Terrorism can be reinterpreted by states in ways contingent on their sovereignty that deeply impact, and may even violate, the original intent of the norm.

"LSPR-Induced Catalytic Enhancement Using Bimetallic Copper Fabrics Prepared by Galvanic Replacement Reactions Electrocatalysts; Electrooxidation; Nanocrystal A simple galvanic replacement (GR) reaction-based strategy to create copper-based bimetallic fabrics for photoreductive catalysis is reported. It is shown that a nanostructured Cu@Fabric can be easily converted into bimetallic Cu-Au@Fabric and Cu-Ag@Fabric through a spontaneous electroless process that involves simple exposure of copper fabrics to the aqueous solutions of gold and silver ions. The nanoscale hierarchical ordering of cotton fabrics combined with their high porosity and wettability make them outstanding supports for catalyst recovery and reusability. The deposition of miniscule quantities of expensive noble metals on readily available Cu not only reduces the overall catalyst cost, but also plays a major role in improving the catalyst stability and reusability over several cycles through minimizing Cu oxidation. The synergistic effects of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties of Cu, Au, and Ag allow these bimetallic fabrics into highly active visible light photocatalysts. Mechanistic investigation of the photocatalytic activity provides in-depth information on the electron transfer processes occurring at the catalyst/ reactant interface, revealing electron transport as the rate-limiting step, which could be overcome under visible light photoillumination conditions. The outcomes enhance the understanding of template-supported bimetallic nanostructures for LSPR-induced photocatalysis applications, offering new potential to design multifunctional fabrics for various applications."
"Implementing a coaching model for the development of online teachers Initial Teacher Education; Teacher Identity; Mentoring This paper details a six-step model for coaching online teachers that has been successfully implemented at an Australian university. Drawing on three fields of literatureâ€“online teaching, community of practice theory and coaching programsâ€“the model involves (1) on-boarding and goal-setting, (2) coaching conversations about online teaching strategies, (3) implementing those strategies in the classroom, (4) collecting and triangulating data about their implementation, (5) sharing feedback and data with teachers, and (6) reflection. The success of the model to date and lessons learned from its implementation, will be of interest to the emerging field of academic professional development."
"Photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange from wastewater using a newly developed Fe-Cu-Zn-ZSM-5 catalyst Advanced Oxidation; Ferrioxalate; Degradation Photo-Fenton oxidation is one of the most promising processes to remove recalcitrant contaminants from industrial wastewater. In this study, we developed a novel heterogeneous catalyst to enhance photo-Fenton oxidation. Multi-composition (Fe-Cu-Zn) on aluminosilicate zeolite (ZSM-5) was prepared using a chemical process. Subsequently, the synthesized catalyst was characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray (spectroscopy) (EDX), and Brunauerâ€“Emmettâ€“Teller (BET). Activity of the synthesized catalyst is analysed to degrade an azo dye, methyl orange. Taguchi method is used to optimize color removal and total carbon content (TOC) removal. The dye completely degraded, and 76% of TOC removal was obtained at optimized process conditions. The amount of catalyst required for the desired degradation of dye significantly reduced up to 92% and 30% compared to conventional homogenous and heterogeneous Fenton oxidation processes, respectively."
"Shadow Economy, Corruption, and Economic Growth: A Bayesian Analysis Shadow Economy; Informality; Informal Sector The objective of this paper is to analyze the impact of shadow economy and corruption on economic growth. The data were collected from 10 ASEAN countries in the period 2002â€“2019, including: Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The Bayesian method is used to estimate the research model. This method is an approach with many outstanding advantages but it is rarely utilized in empirical studies. The results show that economic growth is negatively impacted by shadow economy and is positively impacted by corruption control. In other words, the existence of corruption impacts negatively on economic growth. The probabilities of these impacts are 96.36 and 100%, respectively. Accordingly, shadow economy hinders economic growth, while less corruption can significantly improve economic growth. In particular, this study found a negative but rather low impact of the interaction variable between shadow economy and corruption control on economic growth, with the impact probability of 78.32%. This indicates that improving the level of corruption control can help limit the negative impact of shadow economy on economic growth in ASEAN countries, which is an interesting finding of this study. In addition, this study also found a significant impact of the control variables of domestic credit, government expenditure, foreign direct investment, population growth, and inflation on economic growth."
"Experimental investigations of the heat load effect on heat transfer of ground heat exchangers in a layered subsurface Geothermal Heat Pumps; Heat Exchangers; Boreholes To experimentally investigate the effect of heat loads on the thermal performance of vertical ground heat exchangers (GHEs) in a layered subsurface, a series of experiments were conducted using a testing box filled with sand and clay. Temperature distributions during the operation and recovery periods were different in the layered subsurface, where materials with high thermal diffusivities (e.g. sand) excel in both heat transfer and recovery. With more heat transferred from tubes, the sand and clay located close to the tubes showed drastic temperature variations along the length of tubes, especially around the interface between layers. The thermal interference could enhance the layered thermal distribution in the stratified underground, especially in materials with low thermal diffusivities. Moreover, if the applied power increased by four times, the proportion of the temperature difference between sand and clay to the sand temperature increased from 12.9% to 32.7%, which indicated a more severe thermal stratification. Therefore, it is recommended to consider the effect of ground stratification for multi-GHEs with considerable thermal injection and severe thermal interference, especially in materials with low thermal diffusivities."
"The global impact of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) on terrestrial biodiversity Swine; Feral; Crop Damage The International Union for the Conservation of Natureâ€™s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species is a comprehensive database of over 120,000 species and is a powerful tool to evaluate the threat of invasive species to global biodiversity. Several problematic species have gained global recognition due to comprehensive threat assessments quantifying the threat these species pose to biodiversity using large datasets like the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, the global threat of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) to biodiversity is still poorly understood despite well-documented ecosystem level impacts. In this study, we utilized the IUCN Red List to quantify the impacts of this globally distributed species throughout its native and non-native range. Here we show that wild pigs threaten 672 taxa in 54 different countries across the globe. Most of these taxa are listed as critically endangered or endangered and 14 species have been driven to extinction as a direct result of impacts from wild pigs. Our results show that threats from wild pigs are pervasive across taxonomic groups and that island endemics and taxa throughout the non-native range of wild pigs are particularly vulnerable."
"Interrogating urban renewal scenarios using skyline analysis in Fishermans bend, Melbourne Fractal Geometry; Shell; Islamic Architecture Cities are often abstracted through their skylines. They reflect the interactions between historical, social, cultural, and economic forces in their societies (GASSNER 2009). As the skylines of many Australian cities continue to be shaped by urban renewal master plans, planning restrictions define the visual properties of such urban landscapes. In this paper, we take Fishermans Bend in Melbourne as a case study and propose a workflow that allows designers to test scenarios that incorporate variable bulk and height of future built forms. This is accomplished by reconstituting Google Earth 3D building information into photometric point cloud datasets, in order to measure and analyse visual and environmental impacts of future developments. We interrogated three urban renewal scenarios against existing conditions through the following skyline variations, 1) approved applications to be constructed, 2) sug-gested development application, and 3) future development in Fishermans Bend. Two vantage view-points, along the West Gate Freeway and New Quay in Docklands, respectively vehicular and pedes-trian, were identified. In this scenario, we conclude that the sky factor ratio the measure visible sky, based on the unwrapped skyline diagram from the vehicular entry is reduced from 88% in the existing condition to 38 % by the planned future developments. This is a considerable change to the level of visibility and enclosure relative to the public vantage viewpoint, as the sky ratio is comparatively reduced from 75 % to 70 % by the future Fisherman Bend development. Using this method, we are able to quantify the impact of the development proposals. The unwrapped 2D diagram of skyline provided an inclusive method to study visual relationships of between existing and future building heights. In doing so, we weigh the significance of impacts of these scenarios within the realm of public spaces in order to manage the communityâ€™s expectation and perception of their urban environments."
"Renewable energy from the solid-state anaerobic digestion of grape marc and cheese whey at high treatment capacity Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production Globally, wine production annually generates some 11 million metric tonnes of grape marc (GM) while the cheese-making industry releases over 200 million m3 yâˆ’1 of effluent. Where value-creation mechanisms are absent, such wastes may be channelled to landfills. The study aimed to evaluate the bioenergy potential of the combined treatment of such wastes. Digestion of feedstock at a ratio 3/1 GM/CW (w/w) was conducted in unstirred conditions at 45 Â°C, following optimisation through the Taguchi Method. Cumulative biogas and methane yields were 0.601 m3 gas kgâˆ’1 VS and 0.363 m3 CH4 kgâˆ’1 VS, respectively. Firmicutes and Bacteroides mediated hydrolysis and acidogenesis, thus providing metabolites to Methanosarcina. Co-digestion can potentially generate 1330 GW h and 482,000 Mt CO2-equivalents avoidance. Wine and dairy industries jointly present a case for value-creation through a circular economy, thereby reducing the dependency on non-renewables, renewing commitment to the Paris Agreement."
"An ecosystem service perspective on urban nature, physical activity, and health Greenspace; Green Infrastructure; National Parks Nature underpins human well-being in critical ways, especially in health. Nature provides pollination of nutritious crops, purification of drinking water, protection from floods, and climate security, among other well-studied health benefits. A crucial, yet challenging, research frontier is clarifying how nature promotes physical activity for its many mental and physical health benefits, particularly in densely populated cities with scarce and dwindling access to nature. Here we frame this frontier by conceptually developing a spatial decision-support tool that shows where, how, and for whom urban nature promotes physical activity, to inform urban greening efforts and broader health assessments. We synthesize what is known, present a model framework, and detail the model steps and data needs that can yield generalizable spatial models and an effective tool for assessing the urban nature-physical activity relationship. Current knowledge supports an initial model that can distinguish broad trends and enrich urban planning, spatial policy, and public health decisions. New, iterative research and application will reveal the importance of different types of urban nature, the different subpopulations who will benefit from it, and nature's potential contribution to creating more equitable, green, livable cities with active inhabitants."
"Stigmatizing and Mitigating Elements of a TV News Report on Violent Crime and Severe Mental Illness: An Experiment Stigma; Mental Patient; Stereotyping The news media is a major contributor to stigmatizing beliefs that people with mental illness are dangerous and should be avoided. To reduce stigma, it is critical to understand how to reduce the negative impact from stories about violence and mental illness. This study experimentally manipulated elements of a TV news report to explore the effect on stigma. Participants were 838 community adults, mainly from the U.K. and USA, who were randomized to one of two versions of a TV news report describing a violent crime in which the perpetrator has a severe mental illness, one containing additional stigmatizing elements and the other elements thought to mitigate against stigma. Participants completed a variety of stigma outcome measures designed to assess beliefs about dangerousness, fear, and desire for social distance. The effect of the news condition upon stigma was mixed. While several effects were in the expected direction favoring the mitigating condition, these effects were very small and not statistically significant. In contrast, participants in the mitigating condition showed significantly lower prosocial beliefs and greater perceived difference from people with mental illness than the stigmatizing condition. Exploratory analyses suggested that country may have moderated effects. In conclusion, we could not reliably detect a difference between the two versions of the TV news report on stigmatizing outcomes. Further novel research is needed to build the evidence base of how to improve TV reporting of stories involving people with severe mental illness in the context of violent crime."
"Operationalizing Human Values in Software Engineering: A Survey Human-Computer Interaction (HCI); Interaction Design; Semiotics Human values (e.g., pleasure, privacy, and social justice) are what a person or a society considers important. Inability to address them in software-intensive systems can result in numerous undesired consequences (e.g., financial losses) for individuals and communities. Various solutions (e.g., methodologies, techniques) are developed to help 'operationalize values in software'. The ultimate goal is to ensure building software (better) reflects and respects human values. In this survey, 'operationalizing values' is referred to as the process of identifying human values and translating them to accessible and concrete concepts so that they can be implemented, validated, verified, and measured in software. This paper provides a deep understanding of the research landscape on operationalizing values in software engineering, covering 51 primary studies. It also presents an analysis and taxonomy of 51 solutions for operationalizing values in software engineering. Our survey reveals that most solutions attempt to help operationalize values in the early phases (requirements and design) of the software development life cycle. However, the later phases (implementation and testing) and other aspects of software development (e.g., 'team organization') still need adequate consideration. We outline implications for research and practice and identify open issues and future research directions to advance this area."
"In vitro corrosion resistance of a layer-by-layer assembled DNA coating on magnesium alloy Magnesium Alloys; Biodegradable Implant; Corrosion A (polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)) n coating was fabricated via layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly dip coating method. The surface morphologies, chemical compositions and corrosion resistances of the coatings were investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffractometer and electrochemical and hydrogen evolution measurements. The results indicated that the (PVP/DNA) n coating shows a smooth surface with shallow scratches and some corrosion cracks, which possesses a good corrosion resistance in simulated body fluid, especially for n = 20. The (PVP/DNA) n coating can be used as a inducer to construct a biomimetic biocompatible Ca-P coating on Mg alloys. Additionally, we suggest and discuss a corrosion mechanism for the coating."
"Gender violence: marketplace violence and symbolic violence in social movements Mental Health; Sexual And Gender Minorities; Sexual Behavior Drawing on a retrospective case study involving LGBTQ populations and the tobacco industry, we demonstrate how a duplicitous stance by Big Tobacco illuminates the ways that symbolic violence is perpetrated on consumers. We define marketplace violence as the actions and narratives of powerful market actors that perpetuate inequalities that less powerful market actors experience. This research delineates how marketplace relationships perpetuate gender and sexual orientation discrimination, and how powerful market actors engage in invidious action under the guise of community support, thereby undermining community-based social movements."
"Security and the liberal-democratic state. criminalizing young people's politics Citizenship; Austerity Policy; Political Participation The years following the 2008 global recession saw many liberal-democratic states respond to the economic crisis by introducing austerity policies. In turn, this provoked widespread dissent and social movement activism involving large numbers of young people. In response, governments of many different political persuasions moved to suppress these actions by criminalizing political dissent. The article inquiries into state and institutional moves to suppress social movement activism like the 'Maple Spring' student strikes in Quebec, Canada, and the Indignados movement in Spain. While Canada can be described as a 'mature liberal-democracy' and Spain might be better described as an 'emergent liberal-democracy', both criminalized young people exercising their democratic and constitutionally guaranteed rights to free expression and assembly by engaging in various forms of political protests. While some of this can be explained by reference to contradictions inherent in liberal democracies, we consider if it also reflects certain long-standing prejudices directed at young people. Young people have traditionally attracted disproportionate attention from police and legal systems when they are involved in 'conventional' criminal conduct. What role if any did the 'youthful' face of protest play in government moves to criminalize dissent in 2011-12? An account of the 'civilizing offensive' highlights the influence of ageist assumptions that 'young people' require close management. This provides some insight into state responses to young people's engagement in politics when it goes beyond the conventional mode of 'youth participation' prescribed by states committed to managing electoral party politics."
"Productivity benefits of employer-sponsored training: A study of the Australia transport and logistics industry Apprenticeship Training; Firm; Human Capital Theory Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of employer-sponsored workforce training on employee productivity in the Australian transport and logistics industry. It challenges the quantitative notion of the ratio of inputâ€“output per labour hour as the single most important measure of productivity. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilised a mixed-method approach, involving online and on-site survey questionnaires and on-site semi-structured interviews of employers, employees and students within the industry. Survey questionnaires were administered to Vocational Education and Training (VET) learners to determine the dimensions of productivity gains, while qualitative interviews were conducted specifically to capture employersâ€™ perceptions and expectations of the benefits of training. Findings: Results show that the relationship between employer-sponsored training and workforce productivity is multi-dimensional where, ideally, all essential dimensions must be fulfilled to effectively achieve sustainable productivity level. One dimension is the quantitative measure of increased performance as an outcome of enhanced knowledge, skills and competencies. Another relates to the increased self-confidence, job satisfaction and pride. The third dimension is the cost savings that come with increasing employeesâ€™ overall awareness and appreciation of occupational health and safety. The results show that, aside from the dominant theories on training and labour productivity, the perception of the benefits of training on workplace productivity is not merely limited to the conventional understanding of productivity as a simplistic relationship between resource inputs and tangible outputs. Practical implications: Firms should consider redefining the benefits of training to include employee well-being and individual contribution to common team and organisational goals. Organisations therefore should broaden the notion of productivity to incorporate intangible benefits. Originality/value: The use of multi-method approach to investigate the views and perceptions of employees, employers and trainers about the productivity benefits of training and key concerns and challenges for the industry."
"Optimal profile limits for maternal mortality rate (MMR) in South Sudan Maternal Health Services; Prenatal Care; Pregnancy Background: Reducing Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) is considered by the international community as one of the eight Millennium Development Goals. Based on previous studies, Skilled Assistant at Birth (SAB), General Fertility Rate (GFR) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) have been identified as the most significant predictors of MMR in South Sudan. This paper aims for the first time to develop profile limits for the MMR in terms of significant predictors SAB, GFR, and GDP. The paper provides the optimal values of SAB and GFR for a given MMR level. Methods: Logarithmic multi- regression model is used to model MMR in terms of SAB, GFR and GDP. Data from 1986 to 2015 collected from Juba Teaching Hospital was used to develop the model for predicting MMR. Optimization procedures are deployed to attain the optimal level of SAB and GFR for a given MMR level. MATLAB was used to conduct the optimization procedures. The optimized values were then used to develop lower and upper profile limits for yearly MMR, SAB and GFR. Results: The statistical analysis shows that increasing SAB by 1.22% per year would decrease MMR by 1.4% (95% CI (0.4-5%)) decreasing GFR by 1.22% per year would decrease MMR by 1.8% (95% CI (0.5-6.26%)). The results also indicate that to achieve the UN recommended MMR levels of minimum 70 and maximum 140 by 2030, the government should simultaneously reduce GFR from the current value of 175 to 97 and 75, increase SAB from the current value of 19 to 50 and 76. Conclusions: This study for the first time has deployed optimization procedures to develop lower and upper yearly profile limits for maternal mortality rate targeting the UN recommended lower and upper MMR levels by 2030. The MMR profile limits have been accompanied by the profile limits for optimal yearly values of SAB and GFR levels. Having the optimal level of predictors that significantly influence the maternal mortality rate can effectively aid the government and international organizations to make informed evidence-based decisions on resources allocation and intervention plans to reduce the risk of maternal death."
"Resilience in a hostile workplace: the experience of women onsite in construction Personnel; Career Barriers; Employed Women Women working onsite in construction contend with multiple work hazards arising from the masculine-based work culture. Resilience has been proposed as an important asset for trades and semi-skilled women to manage work hazards and retain work focus. An explanatory sequential research design incorporating survey and interview data was used to explore the resilience of women. One hundred and sixty-eight Australian trades and semi-skilled women completed the Employee Resilience Scale and forty-three of these participants were interviewed. Survey results indicate that participants had a high level of employee resilience, suggesting a strong ability to adapt and succeed in a challenging work environment. Thematic analysis of the interview data identified that resilience is considered as a mandatory capability by women working onsite to manage gendered workplace hazards and attain career success. The findings indicate that these women had high levels of resilience despite little to no support from their workplace. Given its importance, it is recommended that resilience development be included in apprenticeship programs to support retention and career success for tradeswomen. Developing the resilience of semi-skilled women requires more consideration from the industry given their precarious employment status and career pathway. More broadly, the results reiterate that more needs to be done to provide a safe working environment for women working onsite. Rather than relying on women to navigate hostile workplaces, construction employers must protect the safety and health of all workers irrespective of gender."
"Analysis of corporate social disclosures of the apparel industry following crisis: an institutional approach Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative This study explores how the social and environmental information disclosed by organisations following a crisis is influenced by the institutional environment. Through content analysis, the study examines disclosures of apparel industry organisations after the Rana Plaza building collapse in Bangladesh. The study finds that the accountability demonstrated by global apparel buyers following a crisis is attributable to Western cultural expectations and norms, legitimacy concerns and global constituent pressures, while the limited accountability demonstrated by garment suppliers operating in a developing country occurs in response to apparel buyer pressures and business survival concerns."
"The impact of international reports on the australian royal commission’s report into institutional responses to child sexual abuse with regard to the catholic church Police; Crime; Homicide In December 2017, the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse published its 17-volume report. Books 1 and 2 of Volume 16 were focused on religious institutions, especially on the Catholic Church where the incidence of child abuse was highest. In its methodology, findings and recommendations, the Royal Commission was heavily influenced by 17 prior government- and Church-sponsored inquiries in Belgium, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, the UK and the US. This article describes in some detail these reports, and assesses through a quantitative citation analysis the impact of these major international reports on the work of the Royal Commission, especially the eight most influential. They added to the credibility, moral authority and depth of the Royal Commission report."
"Digital Kaizen: An Approach to Digital Transformation Alliance Portfolios; Firm; Open Innovation While digital transformation creates opportunities across all industries, many organisations and practitioners struggle to grasp what conducting digital transformation entails and seek directions for how digital transformation programs, especially large and complex ones, can be executed. In response, recent studies have offered such directions and models for guiding digital transformation and put forward suggestions for steps and phases of digital transformation, as well as drivers, enablers, and inhibitors. Many of these proposals are based on the dynamic capabilities framework as a theoretical foundation and invite more research to develop further and/or to refine existing models for digital transformation, especially investigating how dynamic capabilities contribute to digital transformation. In this case study, we explore Digital Kaizen, a systematic approach to conduct large-scale digital transformation developed and applied at our case organisation FPT Software. This approach integrates the Kaizen philosophy into digital transformation practices that lead to digital improvements and transformation of some of the companyâ€™s human resource management processes and its business model. Our analysis and our reflections on our findings lead us to propose a novel Digital Kaizen process model for digital transformation informed by the dynamic capabilities framework."
"Parent-adolescent communication about sexual and reproductive health including HIV and STIs in Oman Communication; Adolescent Sexual Behavior; Pregnancy in Adolescence Parent-adolescent sexual and reproductive health (SRH) communication plays an important role in reducing sexual risk behaviour and preventing HIV. We sought to enhance limited information about the unique barriers to parent-adolescent SRH communication in the Arab states. This mixed-methods study, using a two-phase sequential explorative design, was conducted in 15 public secondary schools (with grades 5 to 10 students aged 10 to 15 years) in Oman. In phase one, 15 parents participated in two single-sex focus group discussions and two in-depth individual interviews. The qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. In phase two, a convenience sample of 250 parents completed a paper-based self-administered questionnaire. Findings showed that parents rarely communicated with their children about SRH concerns, including HIV. Barriers to more open parent-adolescent SRH communication include the fear that such discussion might encourage early sexual debut; feelings of shyness, discomfort and shame; associated socio-cultural taboos; gender mismatch; and lack of SRH knowledge. Findings suggest the need for parental SRH education and training and school based SRH education programmes to improve adolescent SRH. Experience developing these may be helpful to other countries with similar religious beliefs and socio-cultural traditions seeking to improve parent-adolescent SRH communication."
"Engineering meets institutions: an interdisciplinary approach to the management of resilience Critical Infrastructure; Resilience; Disaster Resilience management stretches across the decoupled domains of community, corporate, and public governance. As a result, fostering resilience needs a governance structure that supports collective actions and integrates fragmented fields with different institutional frameworks. In this study, we carry out a review of three different perspectives on resilience -engineering, social, and organizational- in order to explore resilience management in the context of governance of infrastructure systems. We discuss the common practices to address resilience of engineering systems, the need and current trend for integration of institutions into these practices through formal (e.g., policies and regulations) as well as informal mechanisms (e.g., trust, norms, and shared cognitive structures). To illustrate our theorizing, we provide three illustrative case studies. The cases highlight the barriers and enablers across the three perspectives and highlight the inter-organizational context of management of resilience. We uncovered organizational dynamics such as the necessity of establishing critical functionality through organizational capacity for stakeholder engagement, the need for diverse organizations to address institutional complexity in management of resilience, and the importance of decoupling in aligning the outcomes of resilience management practices with policies. We suggest an agenda for future research on managing practices associated with management of resilience."
"Modelling the large-scale yellow fever outbreak in Luanda, Angola, and the impact of vaccination Yellow Fever Virus; Brazil; Flaviviridae Background: Yellow fever (YF), transmitted via bites of infected mosquitoes, is a life-threatening viral disease endemic to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and South America. YF has largely been controlled by widespread national vaccination campaigns. Nevertheless, between December 2015 and August 2016, YF resurged in Angola, quickly spread and becoming the largest YF outbreak for the last 30 years. Recently, YF resurged again in Brazil (December 2016). Thus, there is an urgent need to gain better understanding of the transmission pattern of YF. Model: The present study provides a refined mathematical model, combined with modern likelihood-based statistical inference techniques, to assess and reconstruct important epidemiological processes underlying Angolaâ€™s YF outbreak. This includes the outbreakâ€™s attack rate, the reproduction number (R0), the role of the mosquito vector, the influence of climatic factors and the unusual but noticeable appearance of two-waves in the YF outbreak. The model explores actual and hypothetical vaccination strategies, and the impacts of possible human reactive behaviors (e.g., response to media precautions). Findings: While there were 73 deaths reported over the study period, the model indicates that the vaccination campaign saved 5.1-fold more people from death and saved from illness 5.6-fold of the observed 941 cases. Delaying the availability of the vaccines further would have greatly worsened the epidemic in terms of increased case numbers and mortality. The analysis estimated a mean R0 ÍŒ 2:6-3:4 and an estimated YF attack rate of 0.09-0.15% (proportion of population infected by YFV) over the whole period from December 2015 to August 2016. Our estimated lower and upper bounds of R0 are in line with previous studies. Unusually, R0 oscillated in a manner that was â€œdelayedâ€ with the reported deaths. High recent number of deaths were associated (followed) with periods of relatively low disease transmission and low R0, and vice-versa. The time-series of Luandaâ€™s YF cases suggest the outbreak occurred in two waves, a feature that would have become far more prominent had there been no mass vaccination. The waves could possibly be due to protective reactive behavioral changes of the population affecting the mosquito population. The second wave could well be an outcome of the March-April rainfall patterns in the 2016 El NiÃ±o year by creating ideal conditions for the breeding of the mosquito vectors. The modelling framework is a powerful tool for studying future YF epidemic outbreaks, and provides a basis for future vaccination campaign evaluations."
"Quantitation of carotenoids and fatty acids from Atlantic salmon using a portable Raman device Astaxanthine; Pigmentation; Diet Raman spectroscopy can be a useful tool for performing non-destructive subsurface measurements, allowing for investigations on intact foods that would otherwise require food products to be prepared for analysis, thus creating food waste, and often requiring the addition of chemicals. To overcome this, we have developed a method to measure the concentration of pigment (astaxanthin) and fatty acids in whole, unfilleted Atlantic salmon through the skin using defocused Raman spectroscopy. Subsurface measurements were performed across different regions of Atlantic salmon. PLS regression of the measured spectra gave a moderate correlation between Raman bands and astaxanthin concentration (R2 = 0.5797) and good correlations for fatty acid concentrations (total, saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, trans; R2 = 0.7457 to 0.8249). This work shows that subsurface Raman measurements can provide useful quantitative information regarding important quality parameters (pigment and fatty acid concentrations) that can aid with production in aquaculture."
"On being posthuman in human spaces: critical posthumanist social work with interspecies families Animal Assisted Therapy; Service Dogs; Animals Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes a critical posthumanist orientation to social work as an approach to address the impediments to care experienced by interspecies families. Secondly, it challenges the anthropocentric assumptions that underpin this exclusion of nonhuman family members in human services disciplines such as social work. Design/methodology/approach: This article presents primary data from a qualitative study into social work and other human services practice in the family violence and homelessness sectors in the state of Victoria, Australia. Findings: Social workers undertook companion animal-inclusive practice to counter vulnerability to interspecies families caused by gender- and species-based violence, and by homelessness. Gender- and species-based violence was exacerbated by a lack of refuge options, and contributed to women considering their companion animals to be their children. The vulnerability that homelessness brought upon interspecies families was amplified by stigma within and external to social work and related professions, and the impediment that experiences of homelessness had on being able to provide care for their nonhuman family members. These factors shaped practice with interspecies families. Scope for future practice was also identified. Research limitations/implications: The research findings can be used to inform policy change that includes consideration of nonhuman family members, as well as critical posthuman program design in social work education. Originality/value: Companion animal-inclusive practice with interspecies families in social work is an under researched area, and there is little empirical data available on the nature of this work in Australia. This paper addresses this gap by centring social workers' own accounts of practice. This paper has scope to contribute to education in social work and other welfare fields, with the potential to empower students to challenge assumptions about social work being solely focused on human-centred concerns."
"“Football is war” – FIFA's reactions to a real war and the response of football fans Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: The commentary examines the possible rational for Federation Internationale de Football Association(FIFA) sending a series of tweets on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Design/methodology/approach: The commentary counts and analyses the number of tweets sent by FIFA media between 1 February and 1 March, 2020 and indicates that these concerning the war in Ukraine represent a radical departure from past topics. Stakeholder engagements with the tweets on the war were recorded and these far surpassed other regular topics. Findings: FIFA's stance in condemning the war and taking direct action against Russia was effective in generating far greater stakeholder engagements in Twitter than other football-related posts. While the tweets were favourably received by many fans, not all of that response was positive, and in fact, some were extremely hostile. Originality/value: An analysis of tweets and their responses provides a relatively new and powerful mechanism for gauging stakeholder engagements. The authors also contribute to the literature on communication strategies of sporting bodies by demonstrating how the integration of social issues into social media posts is likely to exhibit a strong response, albeit not always favourable. When sporting bodies (such as FIFA) depart from their core mission, they risk alienating some stakeholders when they delve into controversial social and/or political issues."
"University Accounting Students and Faculty Members Using the Blackboard Platform during COVID‐19; Proposed Modification of the UTAUT Model and an Empirical Study Technology Acceptance Model; Mobile Payment; E-Learning The current COVIDâ€19 pandemic has changed education systems in most countries: some have shut down whilst others, especially in the higher education sector, have introduced electronic/distance learning systems, such as Blackboard platforms. The current study aimed to identify and test the factors that influence accounting studentsâ€™ and faculty membersâ€™ Blackboard platform use during the pandemic. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was extended and modified by adding four new variables: perceived risk, mobility, selfâ€efficacy and selfâ€managed learning. This was done to generate an understanding of peopleâ€™s usage traits. This is the main contribution of the article: the extension of UTAUT in this context and the consideration of online learning in a pandemic environment situation. Pandemics oppose sustainability from numerous contexts. Measures which counteract sustainability risks associated with pandemics, such as use of technology, are critical risk management instruments and are, thus, important for consideration. Through an online survey, the data was gathered from accounting students and faculty staff in an accounting department at Jazan University, Saudi Arabia. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to analyse the data and examine the hypotheses. This study confirmed the hypotheses concerning the influence of the Blackboard platform on mobility, selfefficacy and selfâ€managed learning. This article contributes to the existing UTAUT model by extending our understanding of the influence of factors to use Blackboard platforms. Moreover, the results have practical implications for policymakers, practitioners, online learning product providers and teaching staff looking to develop efficient strategies concerning learningâ€related information technologies."
"High-Resistance Metal Oxide Window Layers for Optimal Front Contact Interfaces in Sb2Se3 Solar Cells Thin Film Solar Cells; Thin Films; Antimony Herein, an in-depth experimental investigation into the effect of employing different high resistance metal oxide (HRMO) layers on the quality of the front contact in solar cells with an fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/(HRMO)/CdS/Sb2Se3/Au device architecture is presented. The application of ZnO or TiO2 HRMO layers between FTO substrates and CdS improves the overall device performance. Short-circuit current gains of â‰ˆ20%, orders of magnitude higher shunt resistances (â‰ˆ104 Î© cm2), and greatly improved device stabilitiesâ€”maintaining over 95% of their initial efficiency over 137 days are observed. A suppression of the unfavorable (120) orientation of the photoactive Sb2Se3 layer is observed in devices with HRMO interlayers. The application of HRMO layers is crucial to prevent both ohmic and non-ohmic current leaks and maintain device stability over time. Cross-over in the current-voltage (JV) curves observed in the case of TiO2 indicates the presence of a high barrier for the diode current in these devices. Wavelength-dependent JV curves coupled with capacitance measurements and simulations show that this barrier can be attributed to a high density of interfacial acceptor states. In contrast, ZnO deposition is found to reduce interface defects and enhance the quality of the front contact, while boosting performance and increasing device longevity."
"Water footprint: applying the water footprint assessment method to Australian agriculture Water Footprint; Water-Energy Nexus; Nexus BACKGROUND: Water footprint assessment is essential for the evaluation of water scarcity that considers both direct and indirect water consumption along the supply chain. This paper presents the estimation of water footprint for locally grown fruits and vegetables in Australia. Water footprint was calculated based on the framework developed in the Water Footprint Assessment Manual for the crops which are the most practicable to grow in Australia. Nine different crops (apples, grapes, tomatoes, oranges, peaches/nectarines, cherries, potatoes, carrots/turnips and almonds) in the agricultural industry were selected and identified as the most water-consumptive crop and least water-consumptive crop. For each type of crop, the three main water footprint components (blue, green, and grey water) were calculated. RESULTS: It was found that almond had the highest water footprint (6671.96 m3 tonâˆ’1) and tomato had the lowest water footprint (212.24 m3 tonâˆ’1) in Australia. From the global comparison, it is revealed that total water footprint for Australian crops is much higher than the corresponding international average values, except for tomatoes, potatoes and almonds. Also, almonds had the highest water footprint among the nine crops investigated. CONCLUSION: The study provides an insight into future sustainable cropping patterns in Australia, which suggest that tomatoes, carrots/turnips, potatoes and apples should continue to be grown in Australia, whereas stone fruit (e.g., almonds) should no longer be grown because of its high water footprint.

"Air Pollution and Tourism: Evidence from G20 Countries Snow Making; Skiing; Skis Theoretically, it is well argued that environmental factors affect the growth of the tourism industry; however, from an empirical perspective, some gaps still exist in the literature. We empirically examine the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions on tourist arrivals in a panel of G20 countries. Using annual data from 1995 to 2014 and a series of panel data models, our results suggest that the growth of both CO2 and PM2.5 emissions adversely affects international tourist arrivals. The results also show that the observed effect of CO2 emissions is more pronounced in developed economies, while the effect of PM2.5 emissions is stronger for developing economies. Given these findings, our study provides and discusses a number of policy and practical implications."
"An assessment of sustainable airport water management: The case of Osaka’s Kansai international airport Greywater; Laundries; Waste Water Airports are an essential infrastructure to facilitate aviation. The substantial growth of aviation has led to a significant increase in water usage by airports. Airports also generate large volumes of wastewater that may include contaminants. Hence, understanding sustainable water management practices is essential in the aviation industry. In this study, an exploratory research design was utilized in the examination of the sustainable water management strategies and systems at Kansai International Airport from 2002 to 2016. The qualitative data were examined using document analysis as part of a case study. The quantitative data were analyzed using regression analysis as part of a longitudinal study. The airport has been able to reduce the total water consumption, water consumption per passenger, and water consumption per aircraft movement, even with increased traffic in recent years. The airport sources water from the municipal authorities and reclaims water for non-potable water uses. The airport conducts regular water quality tests which measure the Chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphates. The airportâ€™s onsite wastewater processing centre processes all wastewaters, which discharges non-reclaimed water into Osaka Bay. With a decrease in water consumption, there has similarly been a decrease in the need to treat wastewater, while the reclaimed water ratio has increased over the period of the study."
"PROTOCOL: Teacher professional development for disability inclusion in low- and middle-income Asia-Pacific countries: An evidence and gap map Inclusive Education; Special Educational Needs; Psychological Practice According to prior research, teacher readiness and capability are key contributors for successful transition towards disability inclusive education, yet in-service teacher professional development for disability inclusion remains an under-researched area. The key objective of this evidence and gap map (EGM) is to locate evidence on interventions for disability inclusion focused teacher professional development (TPD) in low-to-middle-income-countries (LMICs) in the Asia-Pacific region. As such, it will illustrate different levels of evidence for TPD interventions as well as where there is no evidence (i.e., gaps). In other words, the EGM can make agencies aware where they might be operating in an area that is evidence-free or evidence-weak so they can take up interventions that are evidence-based or collect evidence for the intervention they are presently supporting. Thus, the ultimate goal for the EGM is to assist funders and implementing agencies when making decisions as to how to support LMICs in the region to reach their aim of developing quality teachers for the global inclusive education agenda (target SDG 4.c)."
"Publicly Accessible Library Services to Business in the USA and Australia: A Comparison and Analysis Freedom of Expression; National Libraries; Singapore There are various models of library services to business, but these are relatively underutilised in an Australian setting. They are however far better developed in the USA, where there is a long and successful history of providing small businesses with a variety of support services through publicly accessible libraries. This paper defines and explores the models of business services in libraries, reflecting on examples of these models in practice from both Australia and the USA. It then considers the future opportunities for developing and enhancing library service for business provision in Australia, based on these insights."
"Productive partnerships? Driving consumer awareness to action in CSR partnerships Cause-Related Marketing; Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Philanthropy Despite proliferated growth in corporate social responsibility partnerships (CSRPs), there is limited understanding of how consumer groups native to an organization respond to partnership organizations (direct patrons). To redress this, an integrated theoretical framework incorporating consumer behavior, branding and CSR literature was developed focusing on drivers of consumer awareness leading to subsequent responses in a sports team and not-for-profit organization (NPO) partnership context. Systematic comparisons were also made by adopting the perspective of each native consumer group. The proposed conceptual model was tested with data obtained from sports team fans (n = 504) and NPO patrons (n = 355). Results indicate that consumer attributes and engagement with communication channels activate CSRP awareness, although website visitation does not and in line with associative network theory, each consumer group generally go through an awareness-to-action process. Multi-group results demonstrate a stronger intent to act among NPO patrons than fans, indicative of fansâ€™ lower prioritization of CSRPs."
"Environmental impact of discarded apparel landfilling and recycling Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing Globally, around 87% of discarded textiles ended up in landfill, of which more than 90% are reusable and recyclable. Recycling textile waste to other value-added products is economically feasible. To integrate recycling into the apparel waste stream, it is important to know the environmental benefit and impact of the different recycling options. This study presents the environmental performance of apparel recycling and landfill using the life cycle assessment methodology in terms of climate change, acidification, agricultural land occupation and water depletion. Landfill scenarios and recycling scenarios of post-consumer household discarded apparel waste have been developed in the context of Australia. This study finds that the landfill process of natural apparel waste contributes more environmental impact credit compared to synthetic apparel, and this is mainly credited from the power generation from landfill methane gas captured. This study also specifies that the environmental benefit from the landfill process of discarded apparel depends on the ratio of natural fibre and synthetic fibre in discarded apparel. Integration of recycling into the apparel waste stream can potentially generate environmental benefits. A recycling scenario of cleaning wipes shows the highest impact benefits, followed by cotton fibre, insulation material and polyester raw material recycling. Net impact savings of recycling depend on the avoided landfill impact and avoided virgin production impact. The results generated from this study can be useful for future policy recommendations on apparel waste management through recycling. It is clear that increased collection of apparel by recyclers can significantly reduce environmental impact."
"The social and environmental impact of building integrated photovoltaics technology Hot Temperature; Phase Change Materials; Photovoltaic System Various sustainable energy technologies are evolving around the world to reduce the carbon footprints in buildings. Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is one of the emerging sustainable technologies and it refers to a technology where the elements of the building envelope such as facade and roof are replaced with solar cells. However, the adoptability of BIPV technology in buildings is limited as its costs and benefits are unknown to the public. This study aims to review the BIPV literature qualitatively, to explore the beneficial-related and cost-related factors of adopting BIPV technology. A thematic analysis was undertaken among journal papers published between 2011 to 2019 that focused their investigation on integrated solar renewable systems. The identified cost and benefit-related factors were classified into environmental, health, design, and social themes. It is recommended that further research can be undertaken to explore the importance of cost and beneficial factors identified in this study quantitatively. Finally, these factors will assist in quantitatively measuring the societal impacts of BIPV technology."
"An Exploration of the Role of Blockchain in the Sustainability and Effectiveness of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things The main aim of this study is to explore the role of blockchain technology in the sustainability and effectiveness of the pharmaceutical supply chain in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The objectives of this study are: to explore the opportunities for the blockchain technology to address the existing problems in the pharmaceutical supply chain; to uncover the barriers and challenges of blockchain adoption and implementation; to develop guidelines for a successful implementation of blockchain in the context of Saudi Arabia; and to investigate the perceptions of professionals about the impact of blockchain adoption in the pharmaceutical supply chain sector. The researchers have identified issues surrounding the lack of integration of IT systems in the healthcare systems in KSA. Further problems have been identified: such as medication shortage, lack of coordination among healthcare stakeholders, product wastage and lack of medication demand information. Blockchain, as a distributed digital ledger technology which ensures transparency, traceability and security, is considered as a promise for easing some supply chain management problems. The evaluation of the impact of 'Technology, Organisation, Environment' (TOE) theory, will provide a clear picture to comprehend the influence of these factors on the sustainability of the supply chain, and thus the supply chain effectiveness. This study provides a theoretical model for the impact of blockchain implementation on the sustainability and effectiveness of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Researchers highlighted issues in the current management of the pharmaceutical supply chain and explained how blockchain can be used to solve these problems and how blockchain can address and support the sustainability of supply chains. While the technology of blockchain is definitely in its infancy, the researchers have already seen success in its everyday deployment, especially in the pharmaceutical and financial sectors."
"The impact of wastewater characteristics, algal species selection and immobilisation on simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water Nutrient removal from wastewater reduces the environmental impact of its discharge and provides opportunity for water reclamation. Algae can accomplish simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal while also adding value to the wastewater treatment process through resource recovery. The application of algae to wastewater treatment has been limited by a low rate of nutrient removal and difficulty in recovering the algal biomass. Immobilising the algal cells can aid in overcoming both these issues and so improve the feasibility of algal wastewater treatment. Trends for nutrient removal by algal systems over different wastewater characteristics and physical conditions are reviewed. The impact that the selection of algal species and immobilisation has on simultaneous nutrient removal as well as the interdependence of nitrogen and phosphorus are established. Understanding these behaviours will allow the performance of algal wastewater treatment systems to be predicted, assist in their optimisation, and help to identify directions for future research."
"Si: Survivability under overheating: The impact of regional and global climate change on the vulnerable and low-income population Heat Wave; Climate Change; Distributed Lag The present special issue discusses three significant challenges of the built environment, namely regional and global climate change, vulnerability, and survivability under the changing climate. Synergies between local climate change, energy consumption of buildings and energy poverty, and health risks highlight the necessity to develop mitigation strategies to counterbalance overheating impacts. The studies presented here assess the underlying issues related to urban overheating. Further, the impacts of temperature extremes on the low-income population and increased morbidity and mortality have been discussed. The increasing intensity, duration, and frequency of heatwaves due to human-caused climate change is shown to affect underserved populations. Thus, housing policies on resident exposure to intra-urban heat have been assessed. Finally, opportunities to mitigate urban overheating have been proposed and discussed."
"Transparent Quasi-Interdigitated Electrodes for Semitransparent Perovskite Back-Contact Solar Cells Perovskite Solar Cells; Solar Cell; Formamidine Transparent quasi-interdigitated electrodes (t-QIDEs) were produced by replacing the opaque components of existing QIDEs with indium tin oxide (ITO). We demonstrate their application in the first semitransparent back-contact perovskite solar cell. A device with a VOC of 0.88 V and a JSC of 5.6 mA cm-2 produced a modest 1.7% efficiency. The use of ITO allows for illumination of the device from front and rear sides, resembling a bifacial solar cell, both of which yield comparable efficiencies. Coupled optoelectronic simulations reveal this architecture may achieve power conversion efficiencies of up to 11.5% and 13.3% when illuminated from the front and rear side, respectively, using a realistic quality of perovskite material."
"How are gender inequality and violence against women related? Findings from a population-level community attitudes survey Child Care; Time Use; Domestic Division of Labour Low support for gender equality (GE) predicts attitudes supporting violence against women (VAW). However, little is known about the influence of attitudes toward different manifestations of GE. This study extends knowledge by assessing the relative strength of attitudes to GE across seven theoretically derived dimensions, and their association with attitudes toward VAW. 17,542 Australians participated in the 2017 National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women Survey. Population means were calculated for the following scales formed from survey questions: the Community Attitudes Supportive of Violence Against Women Scale (CASVAWS), the Gender Equality Attitudes Scale (GEAS) and measures within the GEAS representing the theoretical dimensions. There was variation in support for GE between the measures. The lower the support for GE, the higher the support for VAW. Although all GEAS measures included in regression modelling contributed to variance in the CASVAWS, two accounted for more than half. The study suggests benefits in using a multidimensional model of GE to mitigate cultural support for VAW, with emphasis on the private sphere and countering hostility toward women and rigid gender roles and identities."
"Persistence of gender inequality: the role of ethnic divisions China; Institutional Quality; Multicultural Diversity Gender inequality remains a fundamental challenge for global policymakers given that it has detrimental implications for growth and human capital formation. However, studies examining the roots of gender inequality, and what determines the level of inequality are relatively scant. In this study, we seek to contribute to the literature that examines the roots of gender inequality and thus, our objective is to examine the impact of ethnic diversity on gender inequality. We argue that the level of ethnic diversity within a country plays a role in either deepening or bridging gender gaps. Using indices of ethnic fractionalization, we examine the effects of ethnic diversity on measures of gender inequality such as the gender inequality index, and its associated dimensions of empowerment, educational attainment and labour market outcomes. Our evidence suggests that ethnic diversity widens existing gender gaps. We discuss several mechanisms through which ethnic diversity may lead to the increase of existing gender gaps, and lay out various policy approaches to address gender inequality."

The filters show promise for applications in precision agriculture, medical imaging, gas sensing, and other areas."
"Influence of community design and sociodemographic characteristics on teleworking Personnel; Teleworker; Flexible Working The traffic on the roads in many countries has been increasing in recent decades, and the increases in congestion and carbon emission are contributing significantly to climate change. To minimize these adverse effects, the use of more sustainable travel modes, such as public transit, walking, bicycling, carpool and ridesharing, has been widely promoted. Apart from these travel modes, alternatives, such as teleworking, which reduces commute trips, should also be promoted. The objective of this study is to identify different neighborhood design and social characteristics that are associated with teleworking. In this case study, a multiple regression model is applied to 2011 census data and road infrastructure data of 185 communities from the city of Calgary in Canada. In addition, a random intercept model is estimated to account for unobserved heterogeneity. We find that different street patterns, geographical size, land use, mass rapid transit, and road types have a significant effect on teleworking or working-at-home and should be considered when designing new communities. We also find several significant sociodemographic characteristics, including family size, marital status, children, housing type and language. Policy implications based on this research are then provided."
"Climate change impacts on rice-based livelihood vulnerability in the lower Vietnamese Mekong Delta: Empirical evidence from Can Tho City and Tra Vinh Province Mekong River; Dams; Hydropower This paper assesses the livelihood vulnerability and adaptive capacity of rice-based farmers in the lower Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) under the impact of climate change and environmental pressures. We interviewed 600 rice farmers in 19 communes spanning six districts of Can Tho City (middle delta) and Tra Vinh Province (coastal delta). For our analyses, we employed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) framework and the LVI approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (LVIâ€“IPCC). Results indicate that both study areas are vulnerable to climate change and environmental pressures, but the potential threat is greater in the coastal province. Farmers there have responded to climate change and environmental pressures by increasing production inputs, scaling up production areas and transforming cropping patterns, though with little investment in new equipment. Yet, their livelihoods from rice cultivation, and agricultural production in general, remain unsustainable under climate change, which is a matter of concern. This study provides empirical evidence of the vulnerability factors that most undermine farmersâ€™ adaptive capacity and livelihood sustainability in the study areas. This will help local authorities in providing timely support to agricultural production management."
"Effect of acid catalysts on hydrothermal carbonization of Malaysian oil palm residues (leaves, fronds, and shells) for hydrochar production Hydrothermal Carbonization; Hydrochars; Carbon Malaysian oil palm industry produces a significant amount of oil palm residue as solid wastes. These solid wastes are comprised of oil palm residue which contains the stem, fronds from the farms, empty fruit bunch (EFB), mesocarp fibre (MF), and palm kernel shell (PKS) from the oil palmâ€“processing factories. These residues are not successfully reused for other purposes, and the current dumping methods can possibly trigger unfavourable effects to the environment. As oil palm residues are a readily available waste biomass, it has a high potential to be converted into valuable energy-derived products. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), which is a thermochemical process, is a method used to treat biomass to produce hydrochar under hot-compressed water. Oil palm residues (palm leaves, palm fronds, and palm shell) were used as the feedstock for producing carbonaceous hydrochar. The key objective of this study is to examine the effect of the reaction temperature, residence time, and acid catalysts on the HTC process. HTC of oil palm residues was optimized at different operating temperatures from 140 to 300 Â°C and different reaction times between 30 and 240 minutes with a biomass-to-water ratio of 1:10 wt%. Acid catalysts such as citric acid and ascorbic acid were used for the HTC process. The hydrochar produced is further characterized using heating value and elemental and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The yield of hydrochar reduces with the rise of temperature and time but it increases in the presence of acid catalysts. The carbon content of hydrochar is observed to be between 44.36 and 49.50%. The FTIR analysis showed that a high intensity at 1423 cmâˆ’1 indicates a high content of lignin and cellulose in the hydrochar. A considerable decrease in the H/C and O/C atomic ratio shows that the dehydration and decarboxylation take place during the HTC process. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
"Leather-like material biofabrication using fungi Tanning; Chromium; Leather Fungi-derived leather substitutes are an emerging class of ethically and environmentally responsible fabrics that are increasingly meeting consumer aesthetic and functional expectations and winning favour as an alternative to bovine and synthetic leathers. While traditional leather and its alternatives are sourced from animals and synthetic polymers, these renewable sustainable leather substitutes are obtained through the upcycling of low-cost agricultural and forestry by-products into chitinous polymers and other polysaccharides using a natural and carbon-neutral biological fungal growth process. Following physical and chemical treatment, these sheets of fungal biomass visually resemble leather and exhibit comparable material and tactile properties."
"Fire retardancy and thermal behaviors of Cellulose nanofiber/zinc borate aerogel Aerogels; Mechanical Properties; Flame Retardants Cellulose nanofiber (CNF)/zinc borate (ZB) aerogels were successfully prepared via a facile and simple freeze-drying method. The thermal and combustion behavior of synthesized CNF aerogels and CNF/ZB aerogels were systematically investigated via various experimental techniques, including TGA-DTG analysis, micro-scale combustion calorimetry, cone calorimeter, etc. It was known that the CNF aerogels mainly undergo smoldering combustion. The flame retardancy of CNF aerogels was observed remarkably improved with the introduction of ZB, where the formed carbon layer at the sample surface can prevent heat penetration. It was known from micro-scale calorimeter (MCC) test that the burning of CNF/ZB could not last over 20 s, where peak heat release rate and total heat release decrease by 35.1% and 16.3%, respectively, after 2 wt% ZB was added. Meanwhile, the presence of ZB did not affect the porous structure of CNF, which can be proved by the slightly increased thermal conductivity from 0.0276 to 0.0298 W/m K. Flame retardancy of ZB shows its advantages for cellulose aerogels as the improved flame retardancy by ZB will not compromise its original thermal insulation function. The research outcomes of this study provide a new insight for the flame retardancy of cellulose aerogels. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
"The utility of new data in understanding housing insecurity Family Characteristic; Income Shocks; Household Debt â€¢ This exploratory data project investigates the potential of the DSS DOMINO dataset to support housing research and policy development. â€¢ The key difference is that DOMINO is mainly comprised of flow data which gives within year income volatility data rather than stock data which gives a single annual, or point-in-time income and labour force status data. â€¢ Demand for Commonwealth Rental Assistance (CRA) is far higher than commonly understood and there is a significant churn of individuals who receive CRA."
"Projected Extreme Heat Stress in Northern Australia and the Implications for Development Policy Wet-Bulb Temperature; Heat-Shock Response; Threshold Limit Values Heat stress, resulting from elevated heat and absolute humidity associated with climate change, will increasingly occur in the tropics and parts of the mid-latitudes and could threaten the liveability and viability of many regions. Concomitant with predictions of increased heat stress in northern Australia, the Australian Government seeks to boost the population in northern Australia substantially. This paper assesses the heat stress-related wet-bulb temperatures the largest northern centres could experience under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 by 2080. The paper finds that substantial population growth could place significant future urban populations at risk from heat stress-related health issues."
"Gut Microbial Changes, Interactions, and Their Implications on Human Lifecycle: An Ageing Perspective Intestine Flora; Ruminococcaceae; Microorganisms Gut microbiota is established during birth and evolves with age, mostly maintaining the commensal relationship with the host. A growing body of clinical evidence suggests an intricate relationship between the gut microbiota and the immune system. With ageing, the gut microbiota develops significant imbalances in the major phyla such as the anaerobic Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as well as a diverse range of facultative organisms, resulting in impaired immune responses. Antimicrobial therapy is commonly used for the treatment of infections; however, this may also result in the loss of normal gut flora. Advanced age, antibiotic use, underlying diseases, infections, hormonal differences, circadian rhythm, and malnutrition, either alone or in combination, contribute to the problem. This nonbeneficial gastrointestinal modulation may be reversed by judicious and controlled use of antibiotics and the appropriate use of prebiotics and probiotics. In certain persistent, recurrent settings, the option of faecal microbiota transplantation can be explored. The aim of the current review is to focus on the establishment and alteration of gut microbiota, with ageing. The review also discusses the potential role of gut microbiota in regulating the immune system, together with its function in healthy and diseased state."
"The Role of Cultural Heritage in Promoting Urban Sustainability: A Brief Review Community Supported Agriculture; Urban Agriculture; Local Food Systems Cities are hubs of social and cultural activity, and culture is key to what makes cities creative, and sustainable. The Post-2015 Development Agenda has prioritized culture and how it may help people and communities create the future they desire. The study aims to determine the link between cultural heritage and urban sustainability and how multidisciplinary education can help organize urban issues. The article is of relevance to the emerging multicultural urban society with wide socio-economic disparities straining the global urban resilience and posing a challenge for future policy implementation. A systematic literature review was conducted using the Dimension database, and the results were analyzed using VOS viewer. The study also employed the PRISMA quantitative approach for selection criteria. This paper has identified understudied themes including community heritage, sustainable urban governance, and behavioral and multidisciplinary approaches. It is strongly felt that undertaking this study will not only add to the literature in cultural heritage study but also help further multidisciplinary and knowledge-based inquiry, which is currently evolving in the academic domain. Therefore, urban academics have a duty to resolve the issue confronting global urban sustainability and cultural disputes. Future research is required to simplify the current complex issue to make it more relevant and inclusive."
"Detection of helminth ova in wastewater using recombinase polymerase amplification coupled to lateral flow strips Schistosomiasis Haematobia; Helminthiasis; Period Prevalence Ascaris lumbricoides is a major soil-transmitted helminth that is highly infective to humans. The ova of A. lumbricoides are able to survive wastewater treatment, thus making it an indicator organism for effective water treatment and sanitation. Hence, Ascaris ova must be removed from wastewater matrices for the safe use of recycled water. Current microscopic techniques for identification and enumeration of Ascaris ova are laborious and cumbersome. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques are sensitive and specific, however, major constraints lie in having to transport samples to a centralised laboratory, the requirement for sophisticated instrumentation and skilled personnel. To address this issue, a rapid, highly specific, sensitive, and affordable method for the detection of helminth ova was developed utilising recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) coupled with lateral flow (LF) strips. In this study, Ascaris suum ova were used to demonstrate the potential use of the RPA-LF assay. The method was faster (< 30 min) with optimal temperature at 37 Â°C and greater sensitivity than PCR-based approaches with detection as low as 2 femtograms of DNA. Furthermore, ova from two different helminth genera were able to be detected as a multiplex assay using a single lateral flow strip, which could significantly reduce the time and the cost of helminth identification. The RPA-LF system represents an accurate, rapid, and cost-effective technology that could replace the existing detection methods, which are technically challenged and not ideal for on-site detection in wastewater treatment plants."
"Building biodiversity into the urban fabric: A case study in applying Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design (BSUD) Urban Biodiversity; Urbanization; Birds Biodiversity within cities is fundamental for human health and well-being, and delivers a wide range of critical ecosystem services. However, biodiversity is often viewed as an afterthought or final addition once an urban development nears completion. As such, provisions for biodiversity are typically tokenistic and do not achieve the experience of everyday nature that people need. Considering biodiversity requirements at the start of an urban development allows for strategic, intentional design with biodiversity enhancement in mind. Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design (BSUD) is a protocol that aims to create urban areas that deliver on-site benefit to native species and ecosystems through the provision of essential habitat and food resources. Here we present a case study demonstrating how BSUD methods can be used to (a) encourage successful outcomes for nature, (b) improve the aesthetics and liveability of the urban form, and (c) engage stakeholders in a process that supports other aspects of urban design including park and streetscape design. Fishermans Bend (Melbourne) is the largest urban renewal project in Australia, and one of the first of this scale to explicitly include biodiversity targets. We outline the methods used to co-create biodiversity objectives with diverse stakeholders, and how these, combined with a quantitative analysis of their potential biodiversity impact, were translated into clear design and planning recommendations. We critically reflect on the success of this method for 1) communicating and facilitating provisions for biodiversity across different stakeholders and 2) providing clear messaging around biodiversity across different planning disciplines."
"A decision-making tool to assess external costs of disaster induced bridge failure Road Network; Vulnerability Analysis; Route Choice This paper presents a novel tool developed to assess the social, environmental and economic costs of disaster induced bridge failure and consequent impacts during reconstruction. This tool takes a holistic and localistic approach to assess impacts of bridge damage, which is found to be lacking in most decision-making tools and is designed to assist decision-makers in the road infrastructure sector to optimise reconstruction processes. The tool is designed to incorporate local knowledge and experience to formal decision-making processes encouraging local initiative and adaptation practices, with less reliance on state level intervention. The research adopted a participatory design approach and was validated through a case-study in a disaster affected region. Results showed that the socio-economic and environmental impacts could account for 25â€“30 % of the total impacts of bridge failure. The analysis showed that the duration of road closure was the most significant parameter influencing the wider impacts. This tool provides an opportunity for decision makers to assess the wider impacts of reconstruction processes and to select options that increase sustainability and resilience of communities."
"Educators' experiences and strategies for responding to ecological distress Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Climate Change; Skepticism Research is increasingly identifying the issues of ecological distress, eco-anxiety and climate grief. These painful experiences arise from heightened ecological knowledge and concern, which are commonly considered to be de facto aims of environmental education. Yet little research investigates the issues of climate change anxiety in educational spaces, nor how educators seek to respond to or prevent such emotional experiences. This study surveyed environmental educators in eastern Australia about their experiences and strategies for responding to their learners' ecological distress. Educators reported that their students commonly experienced feeling overwhelmed, hopeless, anxious, angry, sad and frustrated when engaging with ecological crises. Educators' strategies for responding to their learners' needs included encouraging students to engage with their emotions, validating those emotions, supporting students to navigate and respond to those emotions and empowering them to take climate action. Educators felt that supporting their students to face and respond to ecological crises was an extremely challenging task, one which was hindered by time limitations, their own emotional distress, professional expectations, society-wide climate denial and a lack of guidance on what works."
"Opportunity, ideal or distraction? Exploring stakeholder perceptions of tackling energy poverty and vulnerability among older Australians Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Energy vulnerability intersects with housing, social and health issues, yet current siloed approaches and piece-meal energy assistance initiatives are often leaving â€˜hard to reachâ€™ older householders behind. Cross-disciplinary strategies promise better identification of vulnerable people, sustained relief and scalable solutions, yet such innovative approaches are still rare. Using the Australian in-home aged care services as a case study, this research explored how stakeholders perceived the idea of integrating energy assistance with health services for people aged 65 and over. Understanding the views of potential advocates and adopters may guide the development, design and implementation of such an innovation. This study engaged front-line workers, executives and policy makers across organisations aiming at carbon emission reduction, equity and health. Climate action stakeholders and in-home aged care services staff recognised synergies across their programmes and welcomed the idea as an opportunity to address hidden energy poverty. Equity stakeholders perceived it as an ideal and doubted that its aspirations were likely to be fully realised given the priorities of vulnerable, older people. An aged care services industry representative, however, saw this proposition as a distraction from dealing with the broader challenges of an ageing population. These insights highlight the need to co-design such an initiative. The engagement of health policy makers is critical but challenging. Further research is needed to align energy assistance with the needs and circumstances of in-home aged care services clients and to develop solutions for older renters."
"The potential of adopting struvite precipitation as a strategy for the removal of nutrients from pre-AnMBR treated abattoir wastewater Struvite; Waste Water; Phosphorus Large volume of wastewater consisting complex forms of organics, lipids and nutrients, is discharged from the abattoir (red meat) processing industry. In this study, nutrient rich pre-Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AnMBR) treated abattoir effluent was fed to a struvite (MgNH4PO4.6H2O) precipitator to evaluate the possibility of developing an innovative environmentally sustainable treatment technology to produce nutrient free high-quality treated effluent. A series of continuous and batch experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of pH and presence of Ca2+ on struvite precipitation. The study found that Mg2+:Ca2+ molar ratio of 0.8 (or high Ca2+) impacts on the production and quality of struvite significantly. Pre-AnMBR treated abattoir wastewater with negligible Ca2+ (Mg2+:Ca2+ molar ratio > 20) showed over 80% removal of phosphorus via struvite precipitation. The highest removal rates of both nitrogen and phosphorus were achieved at pH 9.5 with Mg2+:PO4 3âˆ’ molar ratio of 2:1."

"Local food environments, suburban development, and BMI: A mixed methods study Obesity; Farmers' Markets; Grocery Stores More than half the worldâ€™s population now live in urban settlements. Worldwide, cities are expanding at their fringe to accommodate population growth. Low-density residential development, urban sprawl, and car dependency are common, contributing to physical inactivity and obesity. However, urban design and planning can modify urban form and enhance health by improving access to healthy food, public transport, and services. This study used a sequential mixed methods approach to investigate associations between food outlet access and body mass index (BMI) across urban-growth and established areas of Melbourne, Australia, and identify factors that influence local food environments. Population survey data for 3141 adults were analyzed to examine associations, and 27 interviews with government, non-government, and private sector stakeholders were conducted to contextualize results. Fast food density was positively associated with BMI in established areas and negatively associated in urban-growth areas. Interrelated challenges of car dependency, poor public transport, and low-density development hampered healthy food access. This study showed how patterns of suburban development influence local food environments and health outcomes in an urbanized city context and provides insights for other rapidly growing cities. More nuanced understandings of the differential effect of food environments within cities have potential to guide intra-city planning for improving health and reducing inequities."
"Detection of biomarkers relating to quality and differentiation of some commercially significant whole fish using spatially off-set raman spectroscopy Raman Spectroscopy; Bone And Bones; Powdered Foods Aquaculture represents a major part of the worldâ€™s food supply. This area of food production is developing rapidly, and as such the tools and analytical techniques used to monitor and assess the quality of fish need to also develop and improve. The use of spatially off-set Raman spectroscopy (SORS) is particularly well-suited for these applications, given the ability of this technique to take subsurface measurements as well as being rapid, non-destructive and label-free compared to classical chemical analysis techniques. To explore this technique for analysing fish, SORS measurements were taken on commercially significant whole fish through the skin in different locations. The resulting spectra were of high quality with subsurface components such as lipids, carotenoids, proteins and guanine from iridophore cells clearly visible in the spectra. These spectral features were characterised and major bands identified. Chemometric analysis additionally showed that clear differences are present in spectra not only from different sections of a fish but also between different species. These results highlight the potential application for SORS analysis for rapid quality assessment and species identification in the aquaculture industry by taking through-skin measurements."
"Daily life in National Disability Insurance Scheme times: Parenting a child with Down syndrome and the disability politics in everyday places Therapeutic Landscapes; Medical Geography; Mental Health Social inclusion for people with disability is bound up with experiences of place in everyday life. In Australia, the inclusion agenda has been recently propelled by the National Disability Insurance Scheme which promotes â€“ and funds â€“ the full inclusion of people with disability so that their lives are conducted in everyday settings. This article addresses what lies between the aspirational policy principles of full inclusion and the experience of family life with a young child who has Down syndrome. Through auto-ethnographic inquiry, a series of vignettes describe my own encounters in everyday places such as shops, childcare centres and public swimming pools. I focus on â€˜sense of placeâ€™ which is generated through everyday practices and can shape individual identity and belonging. Using ideas from feminist poststructuralism and critical disability studies, I argue that ableist discourses on disability are produced by people in everyday places through their attitudes, actions and expectations, disrupting regular family life and imposing oppressive modes of subjectivity upon children with intellectual disability and their parent-carers. In response, parents of children with intellectual disability are challenged to undertake the political labour of everyday disability advocacy. It is important for social work to recognise that this labour can become a significant part of the contemporary parent-carer role."
"Sulfonated Dopant-Free Hole-Transport Material Promotes Interfacial Charge Transfer Dynamics for Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Perovskite Solar Cells; Solar Cell; Formamidine The integration of a functional group into dopant-free hole-transport materials (HTMs) to modify the perovskite|HTM interface has become a promising strategy for high-performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a sulfonated phenothiazine-based HTM is reported, namely TAS, which consists of a butterfly structure with a readily synthesized N,â€‹N-â€‹bis[4-â€‹(methylthio)â€‹phenyl]â€‹aniline side functional group. The interaction between TAS and perovskite via Pbâ€“S bond induces a dipole moment that deepens the valence band of perovskite and thereby leads to enhanced open-circuit voltage in corresponding n-i-p PSCs. More importantly, the functionalization of perovskite surface via Pbâ€“S bond promotes the hole extraction reaction while suppressing the interfacial non-radiative recombination, contributing to a 20â€“50% performance improvement compared to less- (4-â€‹(methylthio)â€‹-â€‹N-â€‹[4-â€‹(methylthio)â€‹phenyl]â€‹aniline, DAS) or non-interacting (N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline, TAO) counterparts. Consequently, TAS-based PSCs exhibit superior device stability with a high PCE retention (>90% of the initial value) after 125 days of storage in the air."
"Third-generation biofuels from microalgae: a review Biofuel; Nannochloropsis; Chlorella Sorokiniana The first-generation biofuels from agricultural yields are currently not considered as a sustainable energy source. Similarly, the second-generation biofuels produced from nonfood feedstock are not economically viable for its high processing cost. In contrast, the third-generation biofuels from microalgae are considered as the feasible and sustainable solution for future energy demand by overcoming the shortcomings of the previous generations of biofuels. This short review describes the recent research and developments on biofuel production from microalgae. It includes production planning, cultivation strategy, and harvesting and conversion technology including economic viability study for the future prospect of microalgae as a third-generation biofuel."
"Membrane fouling by nanofibres and organic contaminants – Mechanisms and mitigation via periodic cleaning strategies Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter The fouling of water filtration membranes by nano/microplastic fragments can result in the decline of the water flux across membranes, however, the impact of other types of nano/microplastics on filtration processes, such as nano/micro fibres, has not been well characterised. The flexibility and high aspect ratio of nano/micro fibres could favor their adsorption onto filtration membranes, hence the presence of such fibres in water streams constitutes a potential threat to membrane units. In this work, the fouling of ultrafiltration membranes by a mixed system of poly(ethylene terephthalate) nanofibres and organic contaminants commonly found in textile industry effluents was investigated before mitigation strategies based on periodic gas scouring were developed. The nanofibres were prepared by electrospinning and cryo-sectioning using a freezing agent containing the organic contaminants of interest, poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(vinyl alcohol). Results showed that the organic contaminants induced a water flux decline across the membranes of 50% in less than an hour due to internal pore blocking whereas the adsorption of pure fibres as loose entanglements contributed to less than 10% of the permeation loss observed due to low pore coverage. Although applying periodic gas scouring was not efficient to dislodge the organic contaminants from the pores, this cleaning procedure removed up to 75% of the nanofibres from the surface of the membranes due to the shear forces generated by the gas bubbles. Hence, this study suggests that ultrafiltration membranes and gas scouring procedures could be successfully applied to control and limit the presence of fibres present in complex water streams."
"Air pollution, physical activity and health: A mapping review of the evidence Subway Stations; Black Carbon; Air Quality Background: Exposure to air pollution and physical inactivity are both significant risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). These risk factors are also linked so that the change in exposure in one will impact risks and benefits of the other. These links are well captured in the active transport (walking, cycling) health impact models, in which the increases in active transport leading to increased inhaled dose of air pollution. However, these links are more complex and go beyond the active transport research field. Hence, in this study, we aimed to summarize the empirical evidence on the links between air pollution and physical activity, and their combined effect on individual and population health. Objectives and methods: We conducted a non-systematic mapping review of empirical and modelling evidence of the possible links between exposure to air pollution and physical activity published until Autumn 2019. We reviewed empirical evidence for the (i) impact of exposure to air pollution on physical activity behaviour, (ii) exposure to air pollution while engaged in physical activity and (iii) the short-term and (iv) long-term health effects of air pollution exposure on people engaged in physical activity. In addition, we reviewed (v) public health modelling studies that have quantified the combined effect of air pollution and physical activity. These broad research areas were identified through expert discussions, including two public events performed in health-related conferences. Results and discussion: The current literature suggests that air pollution may decrease physical activity levels during high air pollution episodes or may prevent people from engaging in physical activity overall in highly polluted environments. Several studies have estimated fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure in active transport environment in Europe and North-America, but the concentration in other regions, places for physical activity and for other air pollutants are poorly understood. Observational epidemiological studies provide some evidence for a possible interaction between air pollution and physical activity for acute health outcomes, while results for long-term effects are mixed with several studies suggesting small diminishing health gains from physical activity due to exposure to air pollution for long-term outcomes. Public health modelling studies have estimated that in most situations benefits of physical activity outweigh the risks of air pollution, at least in the active transport environment. However, overall evidence on all examined links is weak for low- and middle-income countries, for sensitive subpopulations (children, elderly, pregnant women, people with pre-existing conditions), and for indoor air pollution. Conclusions: Physical activity and air pollution are linked through multiple mechanisms, and these relations could have important implications for public health, especially in locations with high air pollution concentrations. Overall, this review calls for international collaboration between air pollution and physical activity research fields to strengthen the evidence base on the links between both and on how policy options could potentially reduce risks and maximise health benefits."
"Generation of microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii expressing VP28 protein as oral vaccine candidate for shrimps against White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) infection White Spot Syndrome Virus; Shrimp; Gill-Associated Virus White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) is a major cause of mortality in shrimp cultivation on farms all around the world. The serious monetary losses related with its occurrence in susceptible shrimps and the limitations of current methods used to treat WSSV disease in Vietnam, highlight the need for new methods to prevent and to manage the disease. The current study investigates the possibility of expressing the VP28 protein of WSSV from the nucleus of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii for WSSV control. The VP28 protein of WSSV was successfully expressed in C. reinhardtii as confirmed by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR. The immunological parameters analyzed in shrimp administered with 4 mg of dried algae (~ 6 Ã— 107 cells)/1 g shrimp showed a high-level expression of lysosome (LSZ), anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and prophenoloxidase (proPO) compared to the control group. The result of oral administration experiments indicated that vaccinated shrimp survived up to 70% of the time as opposed to control group with 100% mortality. Taken together, the result indicated that recombinant C. reinhardtii expressing VP28 has a potential utility as an oral vaccine candidate against WSSV."
"Rewilding policy futures: Maori whakapapa and the ecology of the subject Integrated Assessment Model; Carbon; Global Temperature Increase The world is changing, but political and educational institutions appears to be stuck in the 19th century. Modern policy and education are both premised on an Enlightenment assumption of the human, rational, individual subject. Increasingly, elements of these philosophical premises are being interrogated. The critique emerges from the environmental interest in collapsing the dualism between subject and object, and reintegrating the human with/in our ecological context. Indigenous philosophy is important for rethinking the integration of the dualism between humanity and ecology. Maori philosophy is a vital counterpoint to the anthropomorphic position of modern policy and education. Taking Maori concepts to inform contemporary philosophy generates a substantive shift in world view that does not lose sight of the solipsist, phenomenological parameters of human sense making, but enables us to make deeper ethical decisions, and transform the basis of education and policy."
"Hybrid propulsion strategies for a multi-modal UAV Ducted Fans; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Transition Flight An integrated hybrid propulsion system of a multi-modal UAV capable of sustained aerial flight, locomotion in water and deployment from a torpedo tube is under development. This paper covers the design and optimisation of integrated hybrid and separate propellers, as well as structural analysis and propeller placement. Hybrid propellers are designed to allow the propulsion system to operate efficiently in both domains with a single propeller while the separate propeller system is intended for maximum efficiency by utilising a different propeller for each domain. Motors are designed for both types of propellers, with challenges and alternative solutions proposed. The separate propeller design is a novel design which proposes the integration of two shaftless motors into a single motor for optimal efficiency. The selection, sizing and design of an aerial/aquatic transition mechanism is performed, along with a valve designed to regulate the mechanism for efficient and sustained thrust. Experiments are carried out for the aerial propeller and gas transition experiments to validate the theoretical results. Future work is also proposed with areas for improvement and development."
"COVID-19, social isolation and the mental health of autistic people and their families: A qualitative study Psychological Support; Mindfulness; COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic and its policy responses have had a detrimental effect on millions of peopleâ€™s mental health. Here, we investigate its impact on autistic people and their families using qualitative methods. Specifically, we addressed: how did autistic people experience an increase in social isolation during the initial lockdown? And how was their mental health impacted by lockdown? Autistic and non-autistic researchers conducted 144 semi-structured interviews with autistic adults (n = 44), parents of autistic children (n = 84) including autistic parents and autistic young people (n = 16). We deployed thematic analysis to identify key themes. The enhanced social isolation accompanying the pandemic had a serious and damaging impact on autistic peopleâ€™s mental health and subjective wellbeing. They spoke of intensely missing friends and more incidental forms of social connection. They also reported intense dissatisfaction with the substitution of embodied, person-to-person connection in health services by online/telephone-based alternatives, sometimes accompanied by serious negative consequences. These findings reveal the fundamental importance of supporting autistic people to maintain direct and incidental social contact during the pandemic and beyond. They speak against established theories that downplay autistic peopleâ€™s need for human connection and the extent to which they have been affected by social isolation during lockdowns. Lay abstract: In this study, we show that autistic people and their families have found it very difficult to deal with the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Autistic and non-autistic researchers spoke to 144 people, including 44 autistic adults, 84 parents of autistic children and 16 autistic young people (12â€“18 years old). We asked them about their everyday lives and mental health during lockdown. People told us that they enjoyed having fewer obligations and demands compared to pre-COVID-19 life. They felt that life was quieter and calmer. But people also told us again and again how much they missed meeting people in real life, especially their friends, and their therapists and support workers. People told us that their mental health suffered because they did not have contact with their friends and services. Importantly, many people (including researchers) think that autistic people do not want friends or to be around people. But our results show that is not true. Many autistic people do want friends and to be around other people. Some peopleâ€™s mental health has been damaged by not being able to see people during COVID-19. Autistic people need support in many areas of life so they can keep socialising and seeing their friends even through difficult times, like pandemics."
"Assessment and management of lake eutrophication: A case study in Lake Erhai, China Sediment-Water Interface; Total Dissolved Phosphorus; Sediment Some wastewater sources, such as agricultural waste and runoff, and industrial sewage, can degrade water quality. This study summarises the sources and corresponding mechanisms that trigger eutrophication in lakes. Additionally, the trophic status index and water quality index (WQI) which are effective tools for evaluating the degree of eutrophication of lakes, have been discussed. This study also explores the main nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) driving transformations in the water body and sediment. Lake Erhai was used as a case study, and it was found to be in a mesotrophic state, with N and P co-limitation before 2006, and only P limitation since 2006. Finally, effective measures to maintain sustainable development in the watershed are proposed, along with a framework for an early warning system adopting the latest technologies (geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing (RS)) for preventing eutrophication."
"Solution processed aligned ZnO nanowires as anti-reflection and electron transport layer in organic dye-sensitized solar cells Dye-sensitized Solar Cells; Squaraine; Coloring Agent Aligned one-dimensional nanostructure-based solar cells have lower-performance than traditional dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC); due to optical and electrical losses. In this letter, we minimized optical/electrical-loss by using low-temperature solution-processed ZnO nanowires (NW) as anti-reflection(AR)/electron-transport(ET) layer in newly designed indoline dye based-DSSCs. AR-layered organic-DSSC exhibit better durability performance and enhanced photocurrent density (Jsc), >26% compared to the bare devices; due to the enhanced light-coupling. Additionally, this letter debates the techniques to increase performance of the DSSCs in terms of current and voltage in detail. Such AR/ET layered architecture will be of broad academic and industrial interest, for example in photodetectors and so on."
"Prediction of Field-Scale Wheat Yield Using Machine Learning Method and Multi-Spectral UAV Data Crops; Leaf Area Index; Hyperspectral Data Accurate prediction of food crop yield is of great significance for global food security and regional trade stability. Since remote sensing data collected from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms have the features of flexibility and high resolution, these data can be used as samples to develop regional regression models for accurate prediction of crop yield at a field scale. The primary objective of this study was to construct regional prediction models for winter wheat yield based on multi-spectral UAV data and machine learning methods. Six machine learning methods including Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) were used for the construction of the yield prediction models. Ten vegetation indices (VIs) extracted from canopy spectral images of winter wheat acquired from a multi-spectral UAV at five key growth stages in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, China in 2021 were selected as the variables of the models. In addition, in situ measurements of wheat yield were obtained in a destructive sampling manner for prediction algorithm modeling and validation. Prediction results of single growth stages showed that the optimal model was GPR constructed from extremely strong correlated VIs (ESCVIs) at the filling stage (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 49.22 g/m2, MAE = 42.74 g/m2). The results of multiple stages showed GPR achieved the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 49.18 g/m2, MAE = 42.57 g/m2) when the ESCVIs of the flowering and filling stages were used. Larger sampling plots were adopted to verify the accuracy of yield prediction; the results indicated that the GPR model has strong adaptability at different scales. These findings suggest that using machine learning methods and multi-spectral UAV data can accurately predict crop yield at the field scale and deliver a valuable application reference for farm-scale field crop management."
"Three notes on a political economy of youth Student Mobility; International Students; Youth Labour Market The paper seeks to makes a contribution to a recent debate in the Journal about what a political economy of youth might look like. The paper will take up aspects of Sukarieh and Tannockâ€™s [2016. â€˜On the political economy of youth: a comment.â€™ Journal of Youth Studies 19 (9): 1281â€“1289] response to the initial contributions by CÃ´tÃ© [2014. â€˜Towards a New Political Economy of Youth.â€™ Journal of Youth Studies 17 (4): 527â€“543, 2016. â€˜A New Political Economy of Youth Reprised: Rejoinder to France and Threadgold.â€™ Journal of Youth Studies.] And France and Threadgold [2015. â€˜Youth and Political Economy: Towards a Bourdieusian Approach.â€™ Journal of Youth Studies], and will take the form of three â€˜notesâ€™: Capitalism: From the first industrial revolution to the third industrial revolution; Youth as an artefact of governmentalised expertise; The agency/structure problem in youth studies: Foucaultâ€™s dispositif and post-human exceptionalism. These notes will suggest that twenty-first century capitalism is globalising, is largely neo-Liberal, and is being reconfigured in profound ways by the Anthropocene, bio-genetics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT). A political economy of twenty-first century capitalism, let alone a political economy of young people, must be able to account for a capitalism that in many ways looks like the capitalism of the First and Second Industrial Revolutions, but which is at the same time profoundly different as it enters what has often been described as the Third Industrial Revolution. It is these profound emergences that pose the greatest challenges for engaging with a political economy of youth."
"Graphene–polyamide-6 composite for additive manufacture of multifunctional electromagnetic interference shielding components Shielding; Effective Bandwidth; Electric Network Analyzers Grapheneâ€“polyamide-6 composite (GC) filament with 9%Â·v/v graphene concentration was applied as feedstock in filament-based material extrusion (ME) additive manufacturing. The materials are characterized by melt flow index (MFI), mechanical properties, dielectric properties, and electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) in the X-band frequency range. Despite high graphene concentration, MFI is unaffected. In ME test specimens; GC has both superior elastic modulus and tensile strength at yield when compared with the neat polymer. Enhanced mechanical properties at high graphene concentration without diminished processability highlight the suitability of polyamide-6 (PA6) as matrix material for graphene composite filaments. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging indicates graphene alignment in GC after printing. In both compression molded (CM) and ME test specimens, dielectric properties and EMI SE of PA6 are enhanced by graphene inclusion. Further analysis reveals that ME has a negative influence on absorption of electromagnetic waves, while reflection is virtually unaffected."
"Unions and corporate social responsibility in a liberal market context: The case of Ford’s shutdown in Australia European Works Council; Employee Representatives; Trade Unions Within many coordinated market economies, labour unions have demonstrated to be key actors in shaping corporate social responsibility. Researchers have, however, paid surprisingly little attention to the role of unions in shaping corporate social responsibility strategies and responses in liberal market contexts. This article extends the emerging research on unions and corporate social responsibility through a case study which investigates union influences over corporate social responsibility within the liberal market context of Australia. We conceptualise the role of unions in corporate social responsibility in this context through an industrial relations lens with particular reference to collective bargaining. Drawing on qualitative data, the case study examines the Ford Motor Companyâ€™s recent closure of its Australian assembly operations which was hailed by a wide range of stakeholders as an exemplar of â€˜best practiceâ€™ in their assistance of displaced workers. We conclude that, while highly socially responsible, Fordâ€™s actions were far from voluntary but influenced by a combination of union influence and a â€˜subsidisedâ€™ corporate social responsibility, where the state, unable and/or powerless to legislate good corporate social behaviour, chose to financially underwrite its cost to the firm. The study represents one of the first studies to demonstrate how unions shape corporate social responsibility strategies of firms in liberal market contexts and how â€˜subsidisedâ€™ corporate social responsibility becomes an alternative political solution within such a context."
"A roadmap for systematically identifying opportunities in ecosystems using scientific publications data Technology Roadmapping; Data Mining; Technological Competitiveness Opportunity identification is a continuous process in ecosystems. However, ambiguities and challenges associated with knowledge exploration and exploitation can retard opportunity recognition processes. This in turn may culminate in excessive expenditure of resources or loss of latent opportunities. The present study adopts an analytical approach and proposes a methodological roadmap that utilizes scientometric and text mining techniques. The roadmap uses data from Web of Science as input, and generates insights that support decision-making about resource saving, strategic planning, investment, and policymaking. Our roadmap extends methods used in studying ecosystems by combining existing and novel techniques in data analytics. Using Python and VOSViewer, we show an exemplary application of the new roadmap, framed in the context of the Nordic countries' renewable energy ecosystem."
"Theoretical issues and political dilemmas in working with men Young; Sex Education; Sexuality This chapter discusses the theoretical issues and political dilemmas involved in working with men in the human services. The main theoretical framework that informs work with men in the human services is sex role theory. The sex role approach to masculinity utilises the theoretical ideas underlying liberal feminism, wherein womenâ€™s disadvantages are said to result from stereotypical customary expectations, internalised by both men and women. In some feminist social work texts, however, all men are seen as a coherent â€˜gender classâ€™ with the same vested interests in controlling women. When men work with men it is important that they recognise the kinship with fellow men. However, the common elements that exist between male workers and male clients present a number of problems. Work with men in the human services should be one aspect of a broader strategy for changing unequal power relations between women and men."
"Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence and CSR: Radical Feminist Theory and a Human Rights Perspective Fair Trade; Global Value Chains; Global Production Networks This paper extends Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) scholarship to focus on issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence. Despite a significant body of work on gender and CSR from a variety of feminist perspectives, long-standing evidence of sexual harassment and sexual violence in business, particularly in global value chains, and the rise of the #MeToo movement, there has been little scholarship focused specifically on these issues in the context of CSR. Our conceptual paper addresses this gap in the literature through two key contributions. First, we extend the theoretical base of CSR scholarship by drawing upon and explicating radical feminist theory, a resource that has been underutilized in the field to date. This theoretical perspective is well placed to offer insights around the issues of sexual harassment and sexual violence, and to explain the centrality of these concerns to the gender equality agenda in business and in CSR. Second, building upon insights from radical feminism, and from research on CSR and human rights, we explicate a business and human rights approach to sexual harassment, sexual violence and CSR. We point to ways in which this approach might be more effective in addressing these issues than previously adopted strategies and suggest directions for future research arising from our analysis."
"A study of gas emissions during the firing process from bricks incorporating biosolids Clay Brick; Brick; Husk Ash This paper investigates the five different gas emissions during the firing process of clay bricks and bricks incorporating biosolids. In this study, three different biosolids produced at the Western Treatment Plant and Eastern Treatment Plant, Melbourne, were used as an alternative raw material to the conventional brick soil to produce bricks. Three sets of bricks were manufactured incorporating 25% of biosolids by weight. Initially, three biosolids samples and brick soil were characterised by their chemical and mineral compositions, organic content and particle size distribution. Brick samples were fired in a tube furnace at a temperature of 1050 Â°C for three hours. Five different gas emissions â€“ SO2, CO2, NO, CO, and HCN â€“ were measured at different temperatures throughout the firing process. The results indicated that all the gas emissions were increased with the addition of biosolids. The energy input and production based factors were developed based on the experimental results, which were then used in the life cycle assessment of biosolids-amended bricks. The cradle-to-gate results of life cycle assessment revealed that the production of biosolids bricks reduced environmental impacts for all impact categories except water depletion impact when compared to conventional bricks."
"An Anthropocene species of trouble? Negative synergies between earth system change and geological destratification Anthropocene; Climate Change; Environment Crisis It is already well understood that unbinding materials and energy from their lithic reservoirs impacts upon Earth systems. But that is just the first stage of a cycle of â€˜Anthropocene troubleâ€™. This paper tracks the multiple ways in which subsequent Earth system change reacts back upon the social infrastructures of subsurface exploitation and the landscapes they produce. Shifting fire regimes, intensifying hydrometeorological events and sea level rise impact upon the infrastructures of hydrocarbon extraction, hydroclimatic change impacts upon infrastructures and landscapes of mineral extraction, and both pyroclimatic and hydroclimatic change impact upon nuclear infrastructures and on landscapes already contaminated by radioactive materials. To make sense of these â€˜negative synergiesâ€™ we draw upon social science diagnoses of late modern hazards as well Anthropocene scienceâ€™s deepening collaboration between â€˜hard rockâ€™ geology and Earth system science."
"Field Trials of Chaotic Advection to Enhance Reagent Delivery Chaotic Advection; Passive Scalar; Liquid Chaotic advection is a novel approach that has the potential to enhance contact between an injected reagent and target contaminants, and thereby improve the effectiveness of in situ treatment technologies. One configuration that is capable of generating chaotic advection is termed the rotated potential mixing (RPM) flow. A conventional RPM flow system involves periodically reoriented dipole flow driven by transient switching of pressures at a series of radial wells. To determine whether chaotic advection can be engineered using such an RPM flow system, and to assess the consequent impact on the spatial distribution of a conservative tracer, a series of field-scale experiments were conducted. These experiments involved the injection of a tracer in the center of a circular array of wells followed by either mixing using an engineered RPM flow system to invoke chaotic advection, or by natural processes (advection and diffusion) as the control. Pressure fluctuations from the mixing tests using the RPM flow system showed consistent peak amplitudes during injection and extraction at a frequency corresponding to the switching time, suggesting that the target hydraulic behavior was achieved with the time-dependent flow field. The tracer breakthrough responses showed oscillatory behavior at all monitoring locations during the mixing tests which indicated that the desired RPM flow was generated. The presence of chaotic advection was supported by comparisons to observations from a previous laboratory experiment using RPM flow, and the Fourier spectrum of the temporal tracer data. Results from several quantitative metrics adopted to demonstrate field-scale evidence of chaotic advection showed that mixing led to improved lateral tracer spreading and approximately uniform concentrations across the monitoring network. The multiple lines of evidence assembled in this proof-of-concept study conclusively demonstrated that chaotic advection can be engineered at the field scale. This investigation is a critical step in the development of chaotic advection as a viable and efficient approach to enhance reagent delivery."
"Greater Knowledge Enhances Complainant Credibility and Increases Jury Convictions for Child Sexual Assault Child Sexual Abuse; Disclosure; Cross Examination Child sexual assault (CSA) cases reliant on uncorroborated testimony yield low conviction rates. Past research demonstrated a strong relationship between verdict and juror CSA knowledge such as typical delays in reporting by victims, and perceived victim credibility. This trial simulation experiment examined the effectiveness of interventions by an expert witness or an educative judicial direction in reducing jurors' CSA misconceptions. Participants were 885 jurors in New South Wales, Australia. After viewing a professionally acted video trial, half the jurors rendered individual verdicts and half deliberated in groups of 8â€“12 before completing a post-trial questionnaire. Multilevel structural equation modeling exploring the relationship between CSA knowledge and verdict demonstrated that greater CSA knowledge after the interventions increased the odds ratio to convict by itself, and that the judicial direction predicted a higher level of post-trial CSA knowledge in jurors than other expert interventions. Moreover, greater CSA knowledge was associated with heightened credibility perceptions of the complainant and a corroborating witness. At the conclusion of the trial, the more jurors knew about CSA, the higher the perceived credibility of both the complainant and her grandmother, and the more likely jurors were to convict the accused."
"The influence of organisational culture on corporate accountants' ethical judgement and ethical intention in Vietnam Accounting Ethics; Ethical Behavior; Ethics Education Purpose: This research examines the impact of organisational culture on the ethical judgement and ethical intention of corporate accountants in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: The study relies on survey data collected from 283 practising accountants in Vietnam. Organisational culture was measured using the Organisational Culture Assessment Instrument, developed by Cameron and Quinn (2011). The Instrument is developed based on the competing values framework comprised of four distinct cultures: clan, hierarchy, market and adhocracy. Ethical judgement and ethical intention were measured based on respondent responses to five ethical scenarios, each linked to a principle of professional conduct in the code of ethics. Findings: The findings indicate that the clan culture (family oriented) is dominant and has a significant positive influence on accountants' ethical judgement and ethical intention. Respondents in the clan culture evaluate scenarios more ethically compared with accountants in the adhocracy and market cultures but not the hierarchy culture. Accountants who emphasise the adhocracy and market cultures display a more relaxed attitude towards unethical scenarios whereas respondents in the hierarchy culture (rule oriented) display the highest ethical attitude. Research limitations/implications: The code of ethics, its content and how it is interpreted and applied may differ between professions, organisations or cultures. Originality/value: Organisational research on ethical decision-making is ample but few studies link organisational culture with ethical judgement and ethical intention from the perspective of individual accountants."
"Additive manufacturing of specific ankle-foot orthoses for persons after stroke: A preliminary study based on gait analysis data Foot Orthoses; Ankle; Orthotic Devices The aim of present study is to investigate the feasibility of patient-specific ankle-foot orthoses fabricated using additive manufacturing (AM) techniques. Then, clinical performance of the AFOs manufactured using material PA12 was evaluated in stroke survivors based on gait analysis data. The ankle and foot were scanned by EinScan-Pro 3D scanner. The software Geomagic Studio was used for modifying the AFO model. After processing the original AFO model into the final required model, material PA12 were used to fabricate the AFOs by Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) technique. Finally, gait analysis of 12 stroke patients was conducted to compare the effects with and without AFO. It took 2 hours from processing the initial AFO model to the completion of final model, and the printing time was 8 hours. The printing thickness of the AFO was 1.2 mm. With respect to the temporal-spatial parameters, the velocity and stride length in the gait with AFO increased significantly as compared to the gait without AFO (P = 0.001, P = 0.002). The cadence increased, double limb support phase decreased, and the step length difference decreased in the gait with AFO; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.117, P = 0.075, P = 0.051). This study confirmed the feasibility of patient-specific AFO fabricated by AM techniques, and demonstrated the process of modifying AFO models successfully. The specific ankle-foot orthoses fabricated by material PA12 have a significant effect on the improvement of velocity and stride length in people with stroke."
"Current status of and future opportunities for digital agriculture in Australia Energy Transition; Innovation System; Sustainability In Australia, digital agriculture is considered immature and its adoption ad hoc, despite a relatively advanced technology innovation sector. In this review, we focus on the technical, governance and social factors of digital adoption that have created a disconnect between technology development and the end user community (farmers and their advisors). Using examples that reflect both successes and barriers in Australian agriculture, we first explore the current enabling technologies and processes, and then we highlight some of the key socio-technical factors that explain why digital agriculture is immature and ad hoc. Pronounced issues include fragmentation of the innovation system (and digital tools), and a lack of enabling legislation and policy to support technology deployment. To overcome such issues and increase adoption, clear value propositions for change are necessary. These value propositions are influenced by the perceptions and aspirations of individuals, the delivery of digitally-enabled processes and the supporting legislative, policy and educational structures, better use/conversion of data generated through technology applications to knowledge for supporting decision making, and the suitability of the technology. Agronomists and early adopter farmers will play a significant role in closing the technology-end user gap, and will need support and training from technology service providers, government bodies and peer-networks. Ultimately, practice change will only be achieved through mutual understanding, ownership and trust. This will occur when farmers and their advisors are an integral part of the entire digital innovation system."
"Municipal solid waste management practices and challenges in the southeastern coastal cities of Sri Lanka Family Characteristic; Solid Waste Management; Cardboard Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) has become a major challenge in Sri Lanka for post-conflict development activities. Many urban areas are facing severe problems in managing 10 to 50 metric tons of waste per day. However, limited research has been carried out to identify the key issues and policy gaps in MSWM. This research studies the existing complexities of MSWM processes, practices, and emerging challenges in three highly congested urban areas in the south-eastern coast of Sri Lanka. A mixed method strategy using field observations, semi-structured interviews and secondary data sources was employed for the data collection. The study revealed that, although the MSWM systems in the urban areas include all necessary elements, their effectiveness and efficiency are not satisfactory due to poor or non-segregation of waste at the source of generation; lack of resources; absence of regulation to reduce waste generation and control polluters; absence of regular collection schedule; and lack of technical know-how and initiatives. The recommendations drawn from the study include feasible solutions and immediate measures required to improve the MSWM before the related environmental and public health problems become a social catastrophe. The recommendations will also greatly contribute in the achievement of developing sustainable cities."
"Sustainable developments and corporate social responsibility in Vietnamese fashion enterprises Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate the status of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility in fashion enterprises in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is qualitative in nature and utilized a multiple case study approach (questionnaires and face-to-face interviews) to achieve the objectives of the research. NVivo was used to analyze the data. Findings: Findings showed that by collaborating with the local artisans to create the unique clothing lines, the fashion brands try to blend and upscale the traditional indigenous clothing styles with modern design concepts to promote the diversity of Vietnamese ethnic culture. The findings also suggest that both the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large enterprises (LEs) should maintain their corporate social responsibility (CSR) concepts to comply with the legal obligations such as salary and welfare benefits for employees, work safety, gender equality and promotions. Further, the CSR activities should address the social issues with their target stakeholders, particularly with the local communities. Originality/value: This study sought to provide a snapshot on the current sustainable practices followed in Vietnamese fashion enterprises."
"Rewilding policy futures: Maori whakapapa and the ecology of the subject Integrated Assessment Model; Carbon; Global Temperature Increase The world is changing, but political and educational institutions appears to be stuck in the 19th century. Modern policy and education are both premised on an Enlightenment assumption of the human, rational, individual subject. Increasingly, elements of these philosophical premises are being interrogated. The critique emerges from the environmental interest in collapsing the dualism between subject and object, and reintegrating the human with/in our ecological context. Indigenous philosophy is important for rethinking the integration of the dualism between humanity and ecology. Maori philosophy is a vital counterpoint to the anthropomorphic position of modern policy and education. Taking Maori concepts to inform contemporary philosophy generates a substantive shift in world view that does not lose sight of the solipsist, phenomenological parameters of human sense making, but enables us to make deeper ethical decisions, and transform the basis of education and policy."
"Profiling interdisciplinary accounting research: an analysis of publication descriptors in three leading journals Ranking; Journal Ranking; AACSB Purpose: The aim of this study is to profile interdisciplinary accounting research and the facilitating role played by researchers by probing the characteristics of published articles in three leading interdisciplinary accounting research journals, Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal (AAAJ); Accounting, Organizations and Society (AOS); and Critical Perspectives on Accounting (CPA). Design/methodology/approach: Profiling analysis is undertaken with a broad scan of publication descriptors in AAAJ, AOS and CPA between 2005 and 2016. Profiling stems from identifying and quantifying the characteristics of interdisciplinary research, and with further analysis, infer generalisations about its content and the community of interdisciplinary researchers. Findings: The published output of 1,462 articles is produced by 1,688 authors affiliated with 660 institutions in 52 countries. The two most high-ranking topics are social and environmental accounting and management accounting. The highest-ranked authors are Stephen Walker, Rob Bryer, Lee Parker and Yves Gendron. The most productive universities are the University of London, Cardiff University and the University of Manchester. The countries highly involved in interdisciplinary accounting research are the UK, USA, Australia and Canada. Research limitations/implications: The data is restricted by the sample of manuscripts based on three interdisciplinary accounting research journals for the period 2005â€“2016 and does not consider manuscripts published in other accounting and non-accounting journals. Additionally, the process of analysing publication descriptors to generate categorised lists was a complex process that may not be replicated precisely by other researchers. Practical implications: The results reported in this study can assist researchers interested in interdisciplinary research on what they may expect to read and understand. Originality/value: The present study profiles interdisciplinary research in accounting to gain a picture of the elements that comprise interdisciplinarity, which, at present, is without empirical investigation."
"Near-ground impurity-free wind and wind-driven sand of photovoltaic power stations in a desert area Solar Reflectors; Dust Removal; Photovoltaic System The ground mounted photovoltaic panel in desert areas is one of the best methods to get the solar energy. Unfortunately, there are no existing wind codes and standards to show the effect of impurity-free wind loads and wind-driven sand loads on ground mounted photovoltaic panels. It is necessary to investigate the characteristics of the impurity-free wind and wind-driven sand flow in desert areas. The characteristics of mean and fluctuating wind data are obtained from a 10 m-high tower set up in a desert photovoltaic power station, Zhongwei, China. The wind-driven sand flow fields in sandstorm climate are built to obtain the sand concentration profile and the impact pressure profile of sand particles using the wind tunnel testing. The sand concentration decreases exponentially with height under the lower wind speed and appears in the form of reverse â€œSâ€ when the wind speed increases. The sand particles movement in the wind-driven sand flow reduces the wind speed and increases the turbulence intensity. To improve the output power and service life of photovoltaic panels in sandstorm climate, it is recommended that the installation height of photovoltaic panels should be 2 m."
"Waste-derived low-cost mycelium composite construction materials with improved fire safety Mechanical Properties; Plywood; Fagus Sylvatica Subsp. Orientalis Mycelial growth attracts academic and commercial interest because of its ability to upcycle agricultural and industrial wastes into economical and environmentally sustainable composite materials using a natural, low-energy manufacturing process able to sequester carbon. This study aims to characterise the effect of varying ratios of high silica agricultural and industrial wastes on the flammability of mycelium composites, relative to typical synthetic construction materials. The results reveal that mycelium composites are safer than the traditional construction materials considered, producing much lower average and peak heat release rates and longer time to flashover. They also release significantly less smoke and CO2, although CO production fluctuated. Rice hulls yielded significant char and silica ash which improved fire performance, but composites containing glass fines exhibited the best fire performance because of their significantly higher silica concentrations and low combustible material content. Higher concentrations of glass fines increased volume-specific cost but reduced mass-specific and density-specific costs. The findings of this study show that mycelium composites are a very economical alternative to highly flammable petroleum-derived and natural gas-derived synthetic polymers and engineered woods for applications including insulation, furniture, and panelling."
"Engagements2 as ‘HCI Material’: Propagating Community Agency, Through Embedded Technologies Human-Computer Interaction (HCI); Interaction Design; Fiction HCI has material attributes. As a sociotechnical assemblage, HCI mediates and/or translates technologies to public(s) and vice versa. It is malleable, â€˜madeâ€™ and crafted and as a material media technology changes our relationships to â€˜thingsâ€™, each other and our surrounding world. Thinking through HCI as material allows us to unite disciplines with technologies, ensuring that how we conceptualise work is tangible and applicable. Working from this understanding of HCI, allows the authors to contextualise Engagements2 as an emerging â€˜materialâ€™ space uniting art, design and other practices often fractured through disciplinary conventions. Traditionally, public engagement encompasses ways organisations engage with external parties. HCI contemporaries, Public Interest Technologies (PITs) empower public stakeholders and municipalities. PITs unravel intractable problems, through design, data, and delivery, thus providing user agency and yields wider societal benefit(s). We question how digital technologies can transition â€˜public(s)â€™, to sustainable approaches. In time, Engagements2 will be commonplace as technologies (PITs, augmented reality, IoT sensing and more) are embedded into public environment(s), if engagement can be defined as a â€˜craft-ableâ€™, material concern. The article unites contemporaries in: the public realm, social design, and public engagement methods to identify the: pitfalls, benefits, and opportunities. There is a need for creating a â€˜best practiceâ€™ roadmap to creative, active engagement. These values go well beyond designing for inclusion and seek for more sustainable and integral interactions, impacts and culture creation."
"How digital natives learn and thrive in the digital age: Evidence from an emerging economy Digital Divide; Internet Use; Education As a generation of 'digital natives,' secondary students who were born from 2002 to 2010 have various approaches to acquiring digital knowledge. Digital literacy and resilience are crucial for them to navigate the digital world as much as the real world; however, these remain under-researched subjects, especially in developing countries. In Vietnam, the education system has put considerable effort into teaching students these skills to promote quality education as part of the United Nations-defined Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4). This issue has proven especially salient amid the COVID??19 pandemic lockdowns, which had obliged most schools to switch to online forms of teaching. This study, which utilizes a dataset of 1061 Vietnamese students taken from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)'s ""Digital Kids Asia Pacific (DKAP)"" project, employs Bayesian statistics to explore the relationship between the students' background and their digital abilities. Results show that economic status and parents' level of education are positively correlated with digital literacy. Students from urban schools have only a slightly higher level of digital literacy than their rural counterparts, suggesting that school location may not be a defining explanatory element in the variation of digital literacy and resilience among Vietnamese students. Students' digital literacy and, especially resilience, also have associations with their gender. Moreover, as students are digitally literate, they are more likely to be digitally resilient. Following SDG4, i.e., Quality Education, it is advisable for schools, and especially parents, to seriously invest in creating a safe, educational environment to enhance digital literacy among students."
"Leveraging smart contract in project procurement through dlt to gain sustainable competitive advantages Bitcoin; Ethereum; Internet Of Things Project delivery on time, with agreed quality and assigned budget, is the desire of project-based companies. Time, quality, and cost are determinants of project success; however, organisations suffer from achieving these three success criteria at the same time. Failures in project delivery cause the loss of the competitive advantage. The recent digital technologies introduce smart contracts to supply chain (SC) operations for improving SC processes. Project procurement is the area for smart contract implementation to deliver successful projects and gain sustainable competitive advantages. The aim of this study was in explaining how smart contracts benefit project organisations through project procurement. Qualitative research design guided this research with phenomenology. Semi-structured interviews generated the data. The obtained research data were analysed with thematic, textual, and discourse analysis. Published industry reports were used to triangulate the data. This study demonstrated an integrated relationship model to answer the research question. The research findings initially identified the fact that smart contracts improve procurement efficiency through cost, time, and quality. Secondly, smart contracts build a trust-less platform where reliability is delivered and reinforced with transparency, traceability, and security. This study found that enhanced procurement efficiency and reliability meet requirements to gain sustainable competitive advantages. This study intends to contribute to industry practices and future research. The correlation of project procurement management success, smart contracts, and sustainable competitive advantages are expected to guide feature research and business practices."
"Understanding and investigating adversary threats and countermeasures in the context of space cybersecurity Helicopter; A-6 Aircraft; Airspace Satellite technologies are used for both civil and military purposes in the modern world, and typical applications include Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) services, which have a direct impact several economic, social and environmental protection activity. The increasing reliance on satellite services for safety-of-life and mission-critical applications (e.g., transport, defense and public safety services) creates a severe, although often overlooked, security problem, particularly when it comes to cyber threats. Like other increasingly digitized services, satellites and space platforms are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Thus, the existence of cybersecurity flaws may pose major threats to space-based assets and associated key infrastructure on the ground. These dangers could obstruct global economic progress and, by implication, international security if they are not properly addressed. Mega-constellations make protecting space infrastructure from cyberattacks much more difficult. This emphasizes the importance of defensive cyber countermeasures to minimize interruptions and ensure efficient and reliable contributions to critical infrastructure operations. Very importantly, space systems are inherently complex Cyber-Physical System (CPS) architectures, where communication, control and computing processes are tightly interleaved, and associated hardware/software components are seamlessly integrated. This represents a new challenge as many known physical threats (e.g., conventional electronic warfare measures) can now manifest their effects in cyberspace and, vice-versa, some cyber-threats can have detrimental effects in the physical domain. The concept of cyberspace underlies nearly every aspect of modern society's critical activities and relies heavily on critical infrastructure for economic advancement, public safety and national security. Many governments have expressed the desire to make a substantial contribution to secure cyberspace and are focusing on different aspects of the evolving industrial ecosystem, largely under the impulse of digital transformation and sustainable development goals. The level of cybersecurity attained in this framework is the sum of all national and international activities implemented to protect all actions in the cyber-physical ecosystem. This paper focuses on cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in various segments of space CPS architectures. More specifically, the paper identifies the applicable cyber threat mechanisms, conceivable threat actors and the associated space business implications. It also presents metrics and strategies for countering cyber threats and facilitating space mission assurance."
"The changing geography of homelessness: A spatial analysis from 2001 to 2016 Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease â€¢ Homelessness on a per capita basis remains highest in very remote areas but is becoming more dispersed nationally with concentrations in major cities growing over time, particularly in the most populous states (NSW and Victoria). By 2016 capital cities accounted for just under two-thirds of all homelessness nationally. â€¢ Changes in homelessness rates between 2001 and 2016 are largely due to factors specific to regions, with little of the change accounted for by the mix of homelessness operational groups in a region, or overall national trends. â€¢ Homelessness is rising in areas with a shortage of affordable private rental housing and higher median rents. This rise is most acute in capital city areas, specifically, Sydney, Hobart and Melbourne. â€¢ The area supply of affordable private rental housing is statistically significantly associated with the variation in homelessness rates nationally, in capital cities and regional areas. Overcrowding accounts for a large part of this variation across areas after controlling for other area-based attributes. â€¢ The impact of labour markets vary across capital cities, regional towns and remote areas. Overcrowding in capital cities is strongly associated with weak labour markets and poorer areas that have a higher than average concentration of males. However, these associations do not hold for overcrowding in remote areas. â€¢ Nationally and in capital cities rates of overcrowding are highest where there is a concentration of children aged less than 14 years. For other forms homelessness, rates are elevated in areas with high concentrations of those aged between 25 and 40 years. In regional and remote areas, rates of all forms of homelessness are elevated in areas with high proportions of children aged below 14 years. Homelessness is lower in city, regional and remote areas where there is a higher than average concentration of married people. â€¢ Area based overcrowding is most strongly associated with areas that are more culturally and linguistically diverse. The area based share of Indigenous persons remains the strongest determinant of homelessness in remote areas. â€¢ There is substantial mismatch between the distribution of homelessness and specialist homelessness service capacity. Nationally, in 2016, 48 per cent of Specialist Homelessness Services (SHS) accommodation capacity and 44 per cent of support capacity would need to shift across SA3 boundaries to better The risk and experience of homelessness is shaped by the places in which people live and gravitate to, either by choice or necessity. Yet most research has focussed on understanding individually based causes, triggers or pathways into and out of homelessness and its consequences for individuals. This research offers policy makers evidence on the changing geography of homelessness. It outlines the extent to which homelessness is becoming more spatially concentrated over time, where it is rising and falling, and of the importance that housing affordability, poverty and labour market opportunities play in reshaping its distribution over time. It seeks to address the policy question: What structural factors are important in driving changes in the geography of homelessness over the period 2001â€“2016, and is service delivery to those with experience of homelessness matching these spatial dynamics? The following research questions address this policy theme: RQ1: How does the incidence of homelessness and its components vary within and between regions, states and territories, and is it becoming more or less geographically concentrated? RQ2: Is homelessness rising or falling in areas where there are shortages of affordable private rental housing, and are Specialist Homelessness Services (SHS) well located to intervene? RQ3: What role do structural factors such as housing and labour markets, demographics and other area-based indicators, play in shaping differences in rates of homelessness between Australian regions, states and territories over the study period 2001â€“2016?"
"A Systems Engineering Approach to Appraise Cybersecurity Risks of CNS/ATM and Avionics Systems Monitoring; Surveillance Technology; Air Traffic Controller The aggregate use of complex cyber-physical systems, incorporation of artificial intelligence and autonomy in flight operations has reconceptualised the aerospace cybersecurity paradigm to a new era. Cybersecurity is about the prevention or mitigation of malicious acts undertaken to either compromise systems directly or access valuable information that could be subject to criminal misuse. The cyber-security of Communication, Navigation, and surveillance / Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) systems is aimed at controlling the effects of such threats and enhancing the safety of flying passengers. Besides, the cybers resilience of state-of-the-art CNS/ATM and avionics systems have been impacted by convoluted risk management issues. The security of legacy aviation and airport infrastructure has been curtailed owing to their annexure to public networks, which constitute a significant risk to the aviation industry and the general public as a whole.The existing control mechanisms in place, with the aim of assuring Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of information, have a multitude of deficiencies in deciding the extent of vulnerability of systems, the severity of impact and subsequently overall risk rating. Weaknesses in some of the security controls which are intended to mitigate the impact of cyber-attacks also contribute towards this issue. A risk-based system engineering solution is envisioned in managing today's cyber-physical systems which may comprise of interwound Systems of Systems (SoS). This paper aims to investigate threats to aviation assets, vulnerabilities of aviation systems and to adopt a holistic approach to mitigate possible risks. The article also recommends a novel methodology to manage risks by enhancing the consistency and accuracy of risk attributes of CNS/ATM systems, avionics and airport systems."
"The 2020 race towards SARS-CoV-2 specific vaccines Nasopharyngeal Swabs; Serologic Tests; COVID-19 The global outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlighted a requirement for two pronged clinical interventions such as development of effective vaccines and acute therapeutic options for medium-to-severe stages of â€œcoronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19). Effective vaccines, if successfully developed, have been emphasized to become the most effective strategy in the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Basic research advances in biotechnology and genetic engineering have already provided excellent progress and groundbreaking new discoveries in the field of the coronavirus biology and its epidemiology. In particular, for the vaccine development the advances in characterization of a capsid structure and identification of its antigens that can become targets for new vaccines. The development of the experimental vaccines requires a plethora of molecular techniques as well as strict compliance with safety procedures. The research and clinical data integrity, cross-validation of the results, and appropriated studies from the perspective of efficacy and potently side effects have recently become a hotly discussed topic. In this review, we present an update on latest advances and progress in an ongoing race to develop 52 different vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis is focused on registered clinical trials (current as of November 04, 2020) that fulfill the international safety and efficacy criteria in the vaccine development. The requirements as well as benefits and risks of diverse types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are discussed including those containing whole-virus and live-attenuated vaccines, subunit vaccines, mRNA vaccines, DNA vaccines, live vector vaccines, and also plant-based vaccine formulation containing coronavirus-like particle (VLP). The challenges associated with the vaccine development as well as its distribution, safety and long-term effectiveness have also been highlighted and discussed."
"Antibacterial profile of a microbicidal agent targeting tyrosine phosphatases and redox thiols, novel drug targets Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Mycobacterium Tuberculosis; Phosphorylation The activity profile of a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor and redox thiol oxidant, nitropropenyl benzodioxole (NPBD), was investigated across a broad range of bacterial species. In vitro assays assessed inhibitory and lethal activity patterns, the induction of drug variants on long term exposure, the inhibitory interactions of NPBD with antibiotics, and the effect of plasma proteins and redox thiols on activity. A literature review indicates the complexity of PTP and redox signaling and suggests likely metabolic targets. NPBD was broadly bactericidal to pathogens of the skin, respiratory, urogenital and intestinal tracts. It was effective against antibiotic resistant strains and slowly replicating and dormant cells. NPBD did not induce resistant or drug-tolerant phenotypes and showed low cross reactivity with antibiotics in synergy assays. Binding to plasma proteins indicated lowered in-vitro bioavailability and reduction of bactericidal activity in the presence of thiols confirmed the contribution of thiol oxidation and oxidative stress to lethality. This report presents a broad evaluation of the antibacterial effect of PTP inhibition and redox thiol oxidation, illustrates the functional diversity of bacterial PTPs and redox thiols, and supports their consideration as novel targets for antimicrobial drug development. NPBD is a dual mechanism agent with an activity profile which supports consideration of tyrosine phosphatases and bacterial antioxidant systems as promising targets for drug development."
"Embracing uncertainty in HCI Human-Computer Interaction (HCI); Interaction Design; Fiction Uncertainty is prevalent characteristic of contemporary life, and a central challenge of HCI. This one-day workshop will explore how HCI has and might continue to engage uncertainty as a generative feature in design, as opposed to a force to mitigate and control. We hope to convene researchers from broad ranging areas to explore the many ways in which uncertainty appears in our research and the different types of responses that HCI has to offer. There is an incredible variety of conceptual formulations of uncertainty and related ideas like risk, ambiguity, and suspense that raise both difficult challenges as well as significant opportunities for creative engagement with societal challenges. During the workshop, we won't seek to ""solve"" uncertainty but rather expand the ways in which we think about and navigate it. In doing so, we will experiment with and contribute to new practices, methods, and concepts for embracing uncertainty. Outcomes of the workshop will include documentation of exercises designed to evoke uncertainty in participants, concept mappings, and a collection of short essays written and refined by participants."
"Ethnic Diversity and Food Insecurity: Evidence from Ghana Food Pantries; Program Participation; Family Characteristic We examine the link between ethnic diversity and food insecurity. Using data from the Ghana Living Standards Survey, we measure food insecurity using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale and measure ethnic diversity at the district level using information from the Ghana Population and Housing Census. After addressing endogeneity, we find that an increase in ethnic diversity is associated with an increase in food insecurity. This result is robust to different approaches to addressing endogeneity, different measures of ethnic diversity and alternative ways of conceptualising food insecurity. Our findings further show that trust, threat of criminal violence and threat of war/conflict are important channels through which ethnic diversity influences food insecurity."
"Sustainable utilization of recycled aggregates: robust construction and demolition waste reduction strategies Concrete Aggregates; Construction and Demolition Waste; Mechanical Properties Purpose: Due to the high demand of concrete, significant volume of natural resources is required, including virgin aggregates. Many studies have shown that the production of concrete has one of the highest CO2 levels. Although efforts are in place to recycle, enormous effects on landfill and the wider environment remain. Research has suggested the importance of reusing construction and demolition waste such as aggregate for use in recycled concrete. However, robust construction and demolition waste reduction strategies are required. There have been numerous researches on the use of recycled concrete and its management in the construction industry. This paper further consolidates this position. Design/methodology/approach: This paper exhibits the barriers and benefits of using recycled aggregates for construction industry. This is achieved via reviewing the current construction and demolition waste reduction strategies used mainly in three countries: the UK, Australia and Japan. These countries were selected since they seemingly have similar construction industry and environment. Subsequently, evolving barriers and benefits of using recycled aggregates for construction industry are also reviewed and discussed. And to support such focus, robust construction and demolition waste reduction strategies will be advocated. Findings: The findings are summarized as follows. The recycling construction and demolition waste could have a positive net benefit compared to the procurement and production of virgin aggregate materials with the same properties. This is not only financially beneficial but also environmentally viable, as fewer resources would be required to produce the same aggregate material. There are effective ways to achieve a high recycle rate target, as demonstrated by Japan. The implementation of a similar recycling process could be implemented globally to achieve a more effective recycle rate through the help of governments at all levels. By creating awareness about the financial and environmental benefits of using recycled aggregate products, large recycling companies can be also enticed to follow suit. Practical implications: The findings from this paper can ultimately support the construction industry to further consolidate and advocate the use of recycled aggregates. Originality/value: To achieve the research aim, this paper reviews some of the main sustainability factors of recycled aggregates (including coarse and fine aggregates) and provides comparison to virgin aggregates."
"Mercury in natural gas streams: A review of materials and processes for abatement and remediation Flue Gases; Mercury; Coal-Fired Power Plant The role of natural gas in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and advancing renewable energy resource integration is undoubtedly critical. With the progress of hydrocarbons exploration and production, the target zones become deeper and the possibility of mercury contamination increases. This impacts on the industry from health and safety risks, due to corrosion and contamination of equipment, to catalyst poisoning and toxicity through emissions to the environment. Especially mercury embrittlement, being a significant problem in LNG plants using aluminum cryogenic heat exchangers, has led to catastrophic plant incidents worldwide. The aim of this review is to critically discuss the conventional and alternative materials as well as the processes employed for mercury removal during gas processing. Moreover, comments on studies examining the geological occurrence of mercury species are included, the latest developments regarding the detection, sampling and measurement are presented and updated information with respect to mercury speciation and solubility is displayed. Clean up and passivation techniques as well as disposal methods for mercury-containing waste are also explained. Most importantly, the environmental as well as the health and safety implications are addressed, and areas that require further research are pinpointed."
"The feminine voice of subversion and inversion: a comparative reading of “The Story of Yingying” and The Tale of Genji Bruno Latour; Evaluation Studies; Rita This paper intends to bring the interrelation between premodern Chinese and Japanese literature under the scope of comparative literature. Anglophone studies of Chinese influence on Japanese literature are scarce due to the legacy of Japanâ€™s emphasis on its own â€œnational literatureâ€ and the contemporary criticisms of influence study. Through a comparative reading of the â€œThe Story of Yingyingâ€ from China and the Japanese canonical work The Tale of Genji, this study argues that it is insufficient to read Genji within the frame of Japanese â€œnational literature,â€ which presumes a homogenous Japanese culture and tradition. In my analysis, a theme of feminine power represented in Chinese narrative is shown to be further developed in Genji. I find that female characters in these Chinese and Japanese literary texts are not always presented as weak or fragile, rather they speak up for themselves audaciously and directly. I suggest that this feminine voice that subverts and inverts power relations in the Genji is a case of a normally covert activity being practised in plain view, what I call an â€œopen smugglingâ€ of feminine power which is also discernible in â€œThe Story of Yingyingâ€."
"Microwave hydrothermal carbonization of rice straw: Optimization of process parameters and upgrading of chemical, fuel, structural and thermal properties Hydrothermal Carbonization; Hydrochars; Carbon The process parameters of microwave-induced hydrothermal carbonization (MIHTC) play an important role on the hydrothermal chars (hydrochar) yield. The effect of reaction temperature, reaction time, particle size and biomass to water ratio was optimized for hydrochar yield by modeling using the central composite design (CCD). Further, the rice straw and hydrochar at optimum conditions have been characterized for energy, chemical, structural and thermal properties. The optimum condition for hydrochar synthesis was found to be at a 180 Â°C reaction temperature, a 20 min reaction time, a 1:15 weight per volume (w/v) biomass to water ratio and a 3 mm particle size, yielding 57.9% of hydrochar. The higher heating value (HHV), carbon content and fixed carbon values increased from 12.3 MJ/kg, 37.19% and 14.37% for rice straw to 17.6 MJ/kg, 48.8% and 35.4% for hydrochar. The porosity, crystallinity and thermal stability of the hydrochar were improved remarkably compared to rice straw after MIHTC. Two characteristic peaks from XRD were observed at 2Î¸ of 15Â° and 26Â°, whereas DTG peaks were observed at 50-150 Â°C and 300-350 Â°C for both the materials. Based on the results, it can be suggested that the hydrochar could be potentially used for adsorption, carbon sequestration, energy and agriculture applications."
"Adaptive governance in carbon farming policies Resilience; Ecological Resilience; Advocacy Coalition Framework This book discusses a variety of different perspectives involved in biodiversity management and bio-sequestration projects in Australia, working towards achieving adaptive governance in carbon farming. It not only examines landholders' motivation but also the challenges of integrating biodiverse forests into the agricultural landscape. Drawing on the contrast between science and policy stakeholders' views on carbon farming and the practical challenges of achieving adaptive governance, the book discusses the significant gap between theory and practice encountered in this field of study. The book suggests ways of improving the decision-making capacity of government officials and policymakers involved in managing carbon and biodiversity markets, as well as introducing measures to promote adaptive governance by engaging landholders in more effective land conservation. Climate change is a pressing issue on the global political agenda, and this book makes an important contribution to the ongoing debate. This book will be an invaluable reference for practitioners, policymakers and researchers interested in alternative forms of governance in natural resource management."
"The value relevance of sustainability reporting: does assurance and the type of assurer matter? Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the relationship between sustainability reporting and firm value, and subsequently, ascertains the moderating effect of assurance and the type of assurer on the sustainability reportingâ€“firm value nexus. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on sample firms from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in South Africa. The fixedâ€effect panel data analysis method is used to estimate the coefficients of the variables. Findings: A significant positive relationship is found between sustainability reporting and firm value. The results also suggest that sustainability assurance has significant explanatory power on firm value. Furthermore, the authors found that the market is unable to distinguish between sustainability assurance services provided by Big 4 audit firms and specialist consultant firms. Practical implications: The authors expect managers will see sustainability reporting and assurance as a business strategy with incremental market value. The study should also serve as a reference for stakeholders engaged in the advocacy for the adoption of sustainability assurance practices on the JSE and other emerging markets. Social implications: The study finds that the South African market rewards firms that purchase third-party assurance to guarantee the integrity of their corporate social responsibility reports. This understanding could help encourage more firms to embrace the concept of sustainability assurance. Originality/value: The study offers a first-hand information on how market participants in Johannesburg, an emerging economy, view sustainability assurance and the services provided by the different assurers."
"Modular Information Management: Using AUSTLANG to Enhance the Classification of Australian Indigenous Knowledge Resources Knowledge Organization; Subject Headings; Decimals This research explores the potential for AUSTLANGâ€“a database of Australian Indigenous languagesâ€“to enhance the identification of Australian Indigenous languages in MAchine Readable Cataloguing (MARC) bibliographic records. At present, it is acknowledged in the discipline of Library and Information Sciences (LIS) that material relating to Indigenous peoples are improperly and/or insensitively classified using mainstream library systems such as Dewey Decimal Classification. AUSTLANG was approved as a MARC language source code in November 2018 and has given libraries the ability to identify Australian Indigenous languages with standardised, culturally sensitive identifiers. The following research considers the variety of orthographies, codes and synonyms available for a sample of four Australian Indigenous languages as listed in AUSLANG and contrasts these with the single, authoritative AIATSIS reference names and codes contributed by the database. This research also considers how AUSTLANG can contribute to the classification of Indigenous Knowledge resources. Currently there is only a small body of technical information available on AUSTLANG and little focussed academic research, making it difficult to ascertain the success and characteristics of its implementation. This research represents an exploratory academic contribution and calls for a wider research effort."
"Producing fit-for-purpose water and recovering resources from various sources: An overview Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production Natural resources, except wind power and solar energy, are depleting, and therefore it is essential to develop and implement best management practices wherever possible. With respect to water, integrated water management is essential to preserve the fresh water for many generations to come. Producing fit-for-purpose water from various sources such as rainwater, wastewater, seawater/brackish water, and stormwater will contribute greatly to conserve the fresh water. By looking at a few wastewater streams, such as domestic wastewater and wastewaters from industries such as textile, aquaculture, mining, meat processing, carwash, and agriculture, generated all over the world informs us that quantifying them and characterizing their qualities are important to understand many aspects. The increase or decrease in consumption and technologies implemented (or need to be implemented) for water and energy savings, recovery of energy and resources from concentrates and other wastes (such as wastewater sludge, agricultural and food wastes) to reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover materials and energy will give clear direction that should be taken in research and development and implementation of technologies for sustainable living."
"Integrating the Input of Stakeholders in Infrastructure Risk Assessment Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management Dynamics associated with the involvement of multiple stakeholders with conflicting objectives often result in significant delays and cost overruns. Lack of a systematic approach to integrate input of a wide range of stakeholders in infrastructure planning results in the neglect of interactional dynamics and can overshadow the accuracy of project schedules and estimates. To address this lack, a systematic approach based on risk assessment is presented in this paper to gauge the relative impact of interactions on project outcomes based on the input of a wide range of stakeholders. With the primary objective of facilitating the input of stakeholders in infrastructure planning, the proposed approach aims to help project developers define and characterize the network of stakeholders in a specific project phase, assess relative importance of risks associated with the interactions based on the fuzzified input of a wide range of stakeholders, and integrate the results of the assessment into the project plans using social network analysis. A case study considering the preconstruction and construction phases of nuclear power plants was used to demonstrate the application of the proposed approach. High interactional risk levels were observed in various degrees of involvement, highlighting the high risk of overlooking actors with a low degree of involvement, such as the general public or a regulatory agency, in project planning. The results further indicate the dynamic nature of interactions in a project's lifetime because degrees of significance for stakeholder interactions changed in different phases of the project."
"Indigenous plants promote insect biodiversity in urban greenspaces Urban Biodiversity; Urbanization; Birds The contribution of urban greenspaces to support biodiversity and provide benefits for people is increasingly recognized. However, ongoing management practices favor vegetation oversimplification, often limiting greenspaces to lawns and tree canopy rather than multi-layered vegetation that includes under- and midstorey, and the use of nonnative species. These practices hinder the potential of greenspaces to sustain indigenous biodiversity, particularly for taxa like insects that rely on plants for food and habitat. Yet, little is known about which plant species may maximize positive outcomes for taxonomically and functionally diverse insect communities in greenspaces. Additionally, while cities are expected to experience high rates of introductions, quantitative assessments of the relative occupancy of indigenous vs. introduced insect species in greenspace are rare, hindering understanding of how management may promote indigenous biodiversity while limiting the establishment of introduced insects. Using a hierarchically replicated study design across 15 public parks, we recorded occurrence data from 552 insect species on 133 plant species, differing in planting design element (lawn, midstorey, and tree canopy), midstorey growth form (forbs, lilioids, graminoids, and shrubs) and origin (nonnative, native, and indigenous), to assess (1) the relative contributions of indigenous and introduced insect species and (2) which plant species sustained the highest number of indigenous insects. We found that the insect community was overwhelmingly composed of indigenous rather than introduced species. Our findings further highlight the core role of multi-layered vegetation in sustaining high insect biodiversity in urban areas, with indigenous midstorey and canopy representing key elements to maintain rich and functionally diverse indigenous insect communities. Intriguingly, graminoids supported the highest indigenous insect richness across all studied growth forms by plant origin groups. Our work highlights the opportunity presented by indigenous understory and midstorey plants, particularly indigenous graminoids, in our study area to promote indigenous insect biodiversity in urban greenspaces. Our study provides a blueprint and stimulus for architects, engineers, developers, designers, and planners to incorporate into their practice plant species palettes that foster a larger presence of indigenous over regionally native or nonnative plant species, while incorporating a broader mixture of midstorey growth forms."
"DAVS-NET: Dense Aggregation Vessel Segmentation Network for retinal vasculature detection in fundus images Vessel Segmentation; Retina Blood Vessel; Hypertension Retinopathy In this era, deep learning-based medical image analysis has become a reliable source in assisting medical practitioners for various retinal disease diagnosis like hypertension, diabetic retinopathy (DR), arteriosclerosis glaucoma, and macular edema etc. Among these retinal diseases, DR can lead to vision detachment in diabetic patients which cause swelling of these retinal blood vessels or even can create new vessels. This creation or the new vessels and swelling can be analyzed as biomarker for screening and analysis of DR. Deep learning-based semantic segmentation of these vessels can be an effective tool to detect changes in retinal vasculature for diagnostic purposes. This segmentation task becomes challenging because of the low-quality retinal images with different image acquisition conditions, and intensity variations. Existing retinal blood vessels segmentation methods require a large number of trainable parameters for training of their networks. This paper introduces a novel Dense Aggregation Vessel Segmentation Network (DAVS-Net), which can achieve high segmentation performance with only a few trainable parameters. For faster convergence, this network uses an encoder-decoder framework in which edge information is transferred from the first layers of the encoder to the last layer of the decoder. Performance of the proposed network is evaluated on publicly available retinal blood vessels datasets of DRIVE, CHASE_DB1, and STARE. Proposed method achieved state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy using a few number of trainable parameters."
"Design and numerical analysis of a hybrid geothermal PCM flat plate solar collector dryer for developing countries Solar Heaters; Drying; Exergy Drying techniques reduce post-harvest food deterioration. However, conventional drying consumes 20â€“25% of the energy used in food processing industries. This work presents a detailed design and comprehensive numerical analysis of a hybrid geothermal-PCM flat plate solar collector, which is in effect a self-sustaining renewable energy food drying system. The applicability of the hybrid geothermal-solar dryer for developing countries with a significant underground geothermal temperature gradient is investigated. The performed numerical analysis promises high efficiency and effectivity of this near-zero hybrid energy technology. The proposed conceptual design assessed using the related mathematical model to assess the functional parameters of the hybrid geothermal PCM flat plate solar collector dryer. Numerical simulation showed that the efficiency of hybrid geothermal PA-FPSC is 20.5% higher than conventional flat plate solar collector when the mass flow rate is at 0.02 kg/s. Therefore, successful integration of this technology to the existing food processing industries of the developing countries could be a step towards the prevention of irreversible climate change achieving SDG 12 (sustainable development goals)."
"Predicting Mobility as a Service (MaaS) use for different trip categories: An artificial neural network analysis Car Sharing; Bike; Autonomous Vehicles Mobility as a Service (MaaS) has gained popularity as a means of sustainable urban transport which makes the understanding of MaaS use critical for its design and promotion. Studies have contributed to the growing understanding of MaaS, its design features, and consumersâ€™ willingness to pay for MaaS in general, without recourse to the differences in traveling for work, social and general purposes. This paper develops and tests models to predict MaaS use by applying artificial neural network analysis, following the cross industry standard process and data mining framework. It also estimates separate models for social, general, and work trips, using 33 input variables reflecting network externality, transaction cost, behaviour, institutional, environmental concern, personal travel, and socio-economic factors. Data are collected from a survey of 331 Australians. The study reveals different sets of socio-economic factors, the impact of Covid-19, and personal travel factors as key predictors of MaaS use for general, social, and work trips with an average prediction accuracy of 68%, 68%, and 75% respectively. The findings can be used to inform strategies and policies on how to attract a user base with respect to socio-economic and personal travel factors for promoting MaaS use."
"The economic rationale for the proposed banking reform in Iceland Financial Crisis; Shadow Banking System; Liquidity Following the traumatic experience of Iceland in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the government is considering seriously a proposal to move to a sovereign money system under which commercial banks do not have the ability to create money by expanding credit. The rationale for such a drastic move can be found in the propositions that fractional reserve banking allows bankers to determine the money supply, that the procyclical behaviour of banks has detrimental consequences for the economy at large, and that the central bank has no power to control the money supply."
"Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol over bismuth promoted BaTiO3 perovskite nanoparticle catalysts Carbon Dioxide; Photocatalysts; Artificial Photosynthesis The photocatalytic reduction reactions of CO2 to methanol over bismuth-promoted BaTiO3 chemical photo-catalyst were reported for the first measurement time. Catalysts were prepared via single step deposition precipitation/solution combustion technique. Phases/morphology were characterised by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)/scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Light absorption spectrum/bandgap energy (Eg) was calculated using ultravioletâ€“visible (UVâ€“Vis) wavelength diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The addition of Ba/Bi increased Eg. Comparing materials, synthesised by combusting, the latter showed a surface high basicity/water adsorption. Tests indicated the formation of alcohols. Bi-containing also demonstrated CO. No CH3OH was found for precipitated though. Activity resulted from the synergetic relationship effect between Bi/Ti, caused by the charge transfer mechanism between these component species, strong interaction phenomena and recombination. All were stable for a long temporal period. In the presence of the Ba or Bi metals over titania, the electrons (eâ€“) from TiO2 form an eâ€“â€“hole pair separation, prolonging their decay lifetime. Ba/Bi-based TiO2 presented produced a CH3OH yield of 5.95 Î¼mol gcatâˆ’1 hâˆ’1, higher compared to structured catalytic systems, described in specific literature reports. As opposed to hydrogen, CH3OH is a renewable storable liquid solar fuel, not only integrating carbon capture and utilisation (CCU), but also power-to-liquid."
"Predicting wavelength-dependent photochemical reactivity and selectivity Click Chemistry; Click; Sulfur Fluorides Predicting the conversion and selectivity of a photochemical experiment is a conceptually different challenge compared to thermally induced reactivity. Photochemical transformations do not currently have the same level of generalized analytical treatment due to the nature of light interaction with a photoreactive substrate. Herein, we bridge this critical gap by introducing a framework for the quantitative prediction of the time-dependent progress of photoreactions via common LEDs. A wavelength and concentration dependent reaction quantum yield map of a model photoligation, i.e., the reaction of thioether o-methylbenzaldehydes via o-quinodimethanes with N-ethylmaleimide, is initially determined with a tunable laser system. Combined with experimental parameters, the data are employed to predict LED-light induced conversion through a wavelength-resolved numerical simulation. The model is validated with experiments at varied wavelengths. Importantly, a second algorithm allows the assessment of competing photoreactions and enables the facile design of Î»-orthogonal ligation systems based on substituted o-methylbenzaldehydes."
"3D Visible-Light-Driven Plasmonic Oxide Frameworks Deviated from Liquid Metal Nanodroplets Antenna; Galinstan; Ecoflex Eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) liquid metal droplets have been considered as a suitable platform for producing customized 3D composites with functional nanomaterials owing to their soft and highly reductive surface. Herein, the synthesis of a 3D plasmonic oxide framework (POF) is reported by incorporating the ultra-thin angstrom-scale-porous hexagonal molybdenum oxide (h-MoO3) onto the spherical EGaIn nanodroplets through ultrasonication. Simultaneously, a large number of oxygen vacancies form in h-MoO3, boosting its free charge carrier concentration and therefore generating a broad surface plasmon resonance across the whole visible light spectrum. The plasmonic chemical sensing properties of the POF is investigated by the surface-enhanced Raman scattering detection of rhodamine 6G (R6G) at 532 nm, in which the minimum detectable concentration is 10âˆ’8 m and the enhancement factor reached up to 6.14 Ã— 106. The extended optical absorption of the POF also allowed the efficient degradation of the R6G dye under the excitation of ultraviolet-filtered simulated solar light. Furthermore, the POF exhibits remarkable photocurrent responses towards the entire visible light region with the maximum response of â‰ˆ1588 A Wâˆ’1 at 455 nm. This work demonstrates the great potential of the liquid metal-based POFs for high-performance sensing, catalytic, and optoelectronic devices."
"Recycling waste rubber tyres in construction materials and associated environmental considerations: A review Rubber Waste; Mechanical Properties; Tires Waste tyres and their accumulation is a global environmental concern; they are not biodegradable, and, globally, an estimated 1.5 billion are generated annually. Waste tyres in landfill and stockpiles are renowned for leaching toxic chemicals into the surrounding environment, acting as breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and fuelling inextinguishable fires. The properties of waste tyre rubber and engineering applications have been previously reported in a range of publications with respect to the environmental, economic, and technical factors. This study compiles and reviews this research with a focus on geotechnical engineering applications, such as earthworks and infrastructure construction. The applications of waste rubber in construction materials includes cementitious concrete, asphalt concrete, and granular materials for earth structures. Crumb rubber, when used as a sand replacement in flowable concrete fill, improved ductility and strength-to-weight ratio. A 40 MPa concrete mix with 0.6% rubber crumb content exhibited optimal strength and air entrainment capabilities, displaying minimal damage after 56 freeze/thaw cycles. Rubber, as a partial replacement for aggregate in road base and sub-base layers, adversely affected the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of the graded aggregate base course. Rubber-soil mixtures as the interface of foundation and structure yielded a 60â€“70 % reduction in vertical and horizontal ground accelerations when subjected to earthquake simulation modelling. There is concern regarding the toxicity of waste rubber incorporated products due to leachates of heavy metals and other chemicals common in tyres. Further comprehensive studies in this area are needed. Leachate studies should be conducted under different pH and liquid to solid ratios."
"Impacts of antibiotic reduction strategies on zootechnical performances, health control, and Eimeria spp. excretion compared with conventional antibiotic programs in commercial broiler chicken flocks Necrotizing Enteritis; Clostridium Perfringens; Toxin Increasing efforts have been made in recent years to reduce antimicrobial use in animal production. The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate, in commercial broiler chicken farms, 2 antibiotic reduction strategies that eliminated the use of antibiotics important for human medicine, in comparison with the conventional use of antibiotics. On 7 broiler chicken farms, a house was allocated to the antibiotic reduction treatments for 6 consecutive flocks, whereas a similar house on the same premises was assigned to the conventional use of antibiotics (CONV) for 6 consecutive flocks. The antibiotic reduction strategies consisted of continuous in-feed use of ionophores (TX1) and continuous in-feed use of ionophores with butyric acid (TX2). In the 84 flocks, zootechnical performance was recorded, lesion scoring at 21 and 28 D of age was performed, and fecal samples were recovered during grow out for Eimeria spp. oocysts counts. There was no statistical difference between TX1, TX2, and CONV for weights at slaughter, feed conversion ratios, average daily gains, age at slaughter, total mortalities, and condemnations. The probability of identifying oocysts in the fecal samples significantly increased with the age of the flock, but there was no significant treatment effect between 7 and 16 D of age. At 19 D of age, the probability of a sample containing oocysts was higher in TX1 than in CONV, but TX2 was not statistically different from TX1 and CONV. Predicted oocysts per gram in CONV flocks were significantly lower between 22 and 34 D of age than in TX1 and TX2 flocks, whereas there were no significant differences between TX1 and TX2 for all ages. Lesion scoring of the gastrointestinal system showed no differences for coccidiosis scores between TX1, TX2, and CONV. No lesions of necrotic enteritis were observed. In conclusion, it was possible to adequately control intestinal diseases and maintain zootechnical performances by relying exclusively on ionophores, when compared with broiler chicken flocks using standard shuttle programs with antibiotic growth promoters."

Following an introductory overview of DRO regulation in Australia and issues associated with privacy and geing access to metadata, focus is then shi to the particular case of PWF metadata, with three emerging themes: The organizational model of PWF provision with relation to DRO, privacy of PWF metadata compared to the privacy of communication data in general, and practical example of quantitative metadata analysis on a real-life dataset generated within public Wi-Fi network."
"The emerging role of Financial Counsellors in supporting Older Persons in financial hardship and with management of Consumer-directed Care packages within Australia Mental Health; Health Literacy; First Aid The role of financial counsellors as providers of information, support and advocacy for those in financial difficulty is a well established mechanism in the mainstream welfare landscape in Australia. In general, the role of financial counsellors is in helping people alleviate or resolve their financial difficulties through improvement of their financial literacy. It is recognised as an important component of policy responses to assist low-income households and individuals in financial stress. The use of financial counsellors for older persons (i.e., those aged 65+ years) however appears to be underutilised. Financial hardship and abuse of older persons within our community are becoming key issues as the population of Australia â€œagesâ€. Existing evidence also suggests that service providers alone do not have adequate skills to address these issues. This paper firstly examines the development of financial counselling in Australia. It then examines the newly emerging role of financial counselling in supporting older persons in addressing barriers to financial literacy and then in navigating the complex landscape of aged care service provision. The current finacialisation, marketisation and complexities of consumer-directed care are identified as key contextual factors. The paper will then discuss an evaluation study of the provision of financial counselling to the older person population designed to support financial hardship and navigation of the complex aged care services system. The findings of the paper are based on an evaluation of the Financial Consumer Rights Council (FCRC), Victoria: Dignity and Debt Financial Difficulty and Getting Older initiative. This pilot initiative included older persons from both community-based and aged care residential facilities in one regional area of Victoria. The initiative, conducted over 2016, was designed to assess the effectiveness of one-on-one financial counselling sessions with older persons that provided consumer advocacy and information about support services and entitlements (including hardship protections) associated with ageing. The evaluation found that the provision of financial counselling to the older person population could be a key mechanism in improving overall financial literacy, avoiding periods of financial hardship and in maintaining financial well-being, quality of life and positive ageing. Findings also demonstrated a need for an expanded model of outreach financial counselling model to better service older persons in more isolated living environments and/or with mobility impairments living in the community, and the potential to situate offices of financial counsellors within medical centres (a space often visited by the ageing population), to co-situate financial health check-ups as an overall element of health and well-being. As such, financial counselling was viewed as well-placed to support older persons in improvement of financial literacy and in supporting navigation of the increasingly complex marketised and consumer-directed care (CDC) landscape of aged care service provision in Australia."
"Designing a ‘Fit-for-Purpose’ Approach to Tracking Progress on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience: Learning from Local Governments in Australia Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Local governments are at the forefront of responding to climate change in developing risk assessments and mitigation and adaptation strategies. In the Australian context, local government plans and strategies are emerging, however the extent to which municipalities are planning effectively for climate change and whether they are delivering on outcomes is difficult to assess. While there are a number of frameworks for monitoring, evaluating and reporting climate change adaptation and urban resilience, very few have been implemented at the local scale. This paper will present a case study from a group of councils in metropolitan Melbourne who have collaborated to develop a â€˜fit-for-purposeâ€™ framework to track how well they are adapting to climate change and to improve their resilience. The project process, framework design, indicators and pilot implementation phase will be outlined including an analysis of the challenges and issues that emerged in developing and implementing an approach to monitoring and evaluation. We seek to contribute to the gap in knowledge around â€˜doing adaptationâ€™ in particular how we can monitor and evaluate progress. In the post Paris climate policy context, much more attention is needed on how we can better understand the â€œactual experience of adaptationâ€ which broadly asks â€œare we adaptingâ€? (Ford and King in Mitig Adapt Strat Glob Change 20:505â€“526, 2015) and in the case of the particular Australian case study presented in this paper, the focus is on how can we assess â€˜How Well Are We Adapting?â€™."
"In vitro corrosion of pure Mg in phosphate buffer solution—Influences of isoelectric point and molecular structure of amino acids Magnesium Alloys; Biodegradable Implant; Corrosion Influences of proteins on degradation of magnesium alloys are of great significance but not well understood. In particular the roles of amino acids, the basic unit of proteins in regulating the progress of biodegradation of magnesium based materials remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the impacts of alanine, glutamic acid and lysine on degradation of pure magnesium in phosphate buffer solution through SEM, XPS, FTIR, potentiodynamic polarisation curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and immersion tests. The changed contents of amino acids in solutions were detected by UVâ€“vis spectrophotometer. Results demonstrate that the charges of the selected amino acids imposed significant contribution to suppressing the degradation of pure magnesium in phosphate buffer solution. The presence of amino acids led to the formation of phosphate-based corrosion products, increasing free corrosion potential, and reduction in corrosion current density and solution pH depending on their isoelectric points and molecular structures. A plausible corrosion mechanism organised by amino acids on pure magnesium was proposed."
"Protestantism and energy poverty Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort There is growing interest in the causes of energy poverty. This study examines the relationship between Protestantism and energy poverty. Employing household panel data for Australia, our preferred estimates, which account for endogeneity of Protestantism, suggest that being Protestant is associated with a 1.7 percentage point decrease in the probability that a respondent is in energy poverty based on Low-Income High Cost and a 2.4 percentage point decrease in the probability that a respondent is unable to heat their home. This result is robust to alternative ways to addressing endogeneity, alternative specifications and other checks. We also find that Locus of Control, income, hours worked, and social capital are channels through which Protestantism lowers the likelihood of being in energy poverty. Our findings shed new light on how cultural, and specifically religious, beliefs influence the proclivity to be in energy poverty and may assist policymakers to identify ways to help reduce the incidence of energy poverty."
"Feasibility of microalgae as feedstock for alternative fuel in Malaysia: A review Biofuel; Nannochloropsis; Chlorella Sorokiniana Biodiesel is an attractive fuel replacement for diesel engine in Malaysia. The application of biodiesel as fuel-blend has been implemented commercially in transport sector in the country. Among various potential feedstock for biodiesel production, microalgae have been appeared as a promising source since a decade due to its' high biomass productivity, rapid growth rate, large amount of lipid content, capability of high CO2 capture and sequestration as well as suitable geographical location to be harvested. The main objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of microalgae harvesting in Malaysia to produce biodiesel and potential to implement microalgae-biodiesel as commercial transportation fuel. This study demonstrated the current scenario of overall biodiesel production and application in Malaysia. Since Malaysia is the world's second-largest oil palm producer, exploitation of edible palm oil for the making of biodiesel is to be blamed as the cause of soaring food price; therefore, the country is currently looking for 3rd generation biofuel sources and microalgae has been preferred for this purpose. Therefore, insight of the significance of microalgae cultivation for this purpose, suitable microalgae candidates and possible feasibility of microalgae biodiesel have been delineated in this review study. Prospects and challenges to implement microalgae biodiesel have also been emphasized in this study. Therefore, the advantages and limitations of this biodiesel can be transparent to government and non-government sectors. Thus, this study can re-direct both sectors in future. Consequently, it may contribute setting an appropriate government policy to encourage microalgae for biodiesel production to sustain the local biofuel and secure economic growth, energy security and improve environmental conditions in near future."
"Human interaction in a virtual reality environment Tactile Feedback; Haptics; Touch Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are becoming useful tools to provide a visual representation of a product, a design or environment without the cost of building a prototype. Other applications include maintenance support, procedures development and workstation design. Currently, VR and AR systems can only display visual and audio cues. For example, in workstation design, i.e., a ship's bridge, aircraft flight deck, command centre, maintenance facility, etc., it is important to for design engineering to determine if the human operator can reach the gauges, switches and controls. To meet the ergonomic and human factor design criteria, the human operator must easily interact with all the displays, instruments, equipment, and controls. This impacts the design and location of seats, instrument panels and windows. VR and AR devices, such as the controllers and gloves, can track the position of the human hand and fingers in a virtual environment but are not able to detect realistic distance or interference with a virtual object. This paper presents a new VR prototype to allow an operator in a fully immersive environment to reach and touch any object in the virtual world. As a case, study the environment was applied to the cabin design of a medical helicopter. Feedback and suggestions from the medical personnel were obtained and are presented."
"Environmental Impact of Algae-based Biofuel Production: A Review Biofuel; Nannochloropsis; Chlorella Sorokiniana Concerns about the rapid depletion of fossil fuels, energy security, climate change due to global warming, environmental pollution, and faster increase of fossil fuel prices have drawn attention to researchers, the scientific community, and government policymakers to develop alternative energy sources for reducing dependence on fossil fuel. In recent years, microalgae culture has received significant attention due to its potential application for bioenergy production, wastewater treatment, industrial CO2 removal, and production of biochemical compounds that can be used for human and animal health and other benefits. However, large-scale microalgae production and their processing for producing various products and by-products could have environmental impacts beyond energy consumption in the microalgal production process. This article has reviewed the environmental effects of microalgae-based biofuel production on water resources and quality, eutrophication, biodiversity, waterborne toxicant, algal toxicity, wastewater remediation or treatment, waste generation, and greenhouse gas land-use changes, and genetically engineered microalgae."
"Love Is Blind! Exploring the Impact of Brand Love on eWOM in Chinese Hospitality Industry Social Media; Online Reviews; Brand Community The rising penetration and value of online information reviews in the hospitality industry have been extensively examined. People are increasingly interacting on interactive online media, prompting firms to create online communities to share electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) with them and with one another in order to increase brand love. This study seeks to discover what drives consumers to participate in these online brand communities. To examine the research model, an online survey was conducted on 508 consumers who had shared eWOM on social networking sites (SNS). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test all hypotheses. The findings show that each of the variables has a high impact on brand love, with information quality and virtual interaction having the most significant impact. As a result of brand love, eWOM is significantly increased. Additionally, findings show that the gender gap in the online setting is increasing, as the influence of all characteristics then reward of online brand communities on brand love was adaptable among both male and female associates. Considering the effects of online features (information quality, system quality, virtual interaction, and reward) on online brand communities' impact on brand love and eWOM. Online hotels manager is advised to carefully develop their marketing strategies to retain and attract new consumers. Furthermore, online hotels manager can use the findings from this study to understand the consequences when eWOM is strongly influenced by online brand communities' features. This study is one of the first to illustrate and empirically confirm insight into how online features affect brand lovers in online brand communities. The study adds to the body of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of social media marketing in the Chinese hotel sector."

"Low impact development, a novel technique for cutting down urban flooding in Quynhon city, Vietnam Bioretention Areas; Stormwater Management; Green Infrastructure Many coastal cities are becoming more vulnerable to flooding due to increases in extreme precipitation as a consequence of climate change and reduction of infiltration due to urbanization. Application of Near-natural stormwater management measures such as Low Impact Development techniques (LIDs) is considered as an alternative option to reduce the risks of urban flooding caused by climate change and urbanization. This technique reduces inundation possibility by using natural or man-made systems to filter and recharge stormwater into the groundwater. In this research, applicability of two LIDs, infiltration trend and swales, was evaluated with case study in Quynhon, Binhdinh province, Vietnam. The results show that, the LIDs work effectively to reduce peak flood and enhance recharged amount groundwater in short duration rainfall. Their effects, however, depend on reaching saturation points of applied measures."
"Economic and environmental assessment of biomass supply chain for design of transportation modes: Strategic and tactical decisions point of view Biomass; Supply Chain Design; Biomass Power Decision-makers face several challenges on transportation network as the main component of logistics management in the biomass supply chain (BSC). Transportation of biomass focuses on how and when to get raw materials, intermediate products, and finished goods from their respective origins to their destinations. Each supplier can implement strategic and tactical decisions to reduce costs and improve local and export customer service levels in a responsive, economic, and sustainable transportation network. In the process of quantifying economic and environmental sustainability, it is necessary to take into account the greenhouse gas emissions and cost resulting from the transportation of the biomass. This study focuses on the techno-economic and environmental assessment of BSC by considering three transportation modes that include truck, train, and barge. For this purpose, a simulation model is developed using AnyLogic software and tested on a case study in Malaysia. Results show that each type of transportation plays a vital role in designing a BSC transportation network to decrease the cost and GHG emissions. The results of this work would help the biomass industry stockholders and suppliers to define long, and short-term horizons to achieve a timely, cost-effective, and sustainable BSC transportation network."
"Entrepreneurial Motivations, Opportunities, and Challenges: An International Perspective Entrepreneurial Intention; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship The current entrepreneurship research has primarily focused on external environmental factors that influence enterprise development in developed economies, whilst studies from developing economies are lagging. Yet, evidence from the World Bank and Global Entrepreneurship Index suggest that entrepreneurship practice in developing economies has peaked. Using semi-structured interview data from 20 entrepreneurs in The Gambia, we examined their motivations for entrepreneurship, the market opportunities and challenges hindering enterprise growth. We found the factors influencing motivation to be individual (necessity, poverty, job creation, personal knowledge, and experience) and contextual (opportunity recognition, ethnic and religious norms). Interestingly, three forms of opportunities were identified: entrepreneurial networks, competitive market, and discovery. Nonetheless, the entrepreneurs faced individual challengesâ€“insufficient finance and unskilled staffâ€“and contextual limitations such as political change, limited government reforms, high taxes, high business cost, and market uncertainty. We offer critical insights into individual and contextual motivations for entrepreneurship, extending the current discourse. In addition, we expose specific dynamic market influences for enterprise development in a developing economy."
"An alternative model for evaluating the balance of carrying capacity between functional urban infrastructures Ecological Carrying Capacity; Environmental Protection; Water Resources Urban infrastructures commonly include four types of functional infrastructures: traditional infrastructures, greenspace infrastructures, water infrastructures, and connective infrastructures. They work as an integrated system for supporting sustainable urban development. It is therefore important for having a proper method to help understand whether there is a balance between functional urban infrastructures' carrying capacities (FUICC). This paper introduces an alternative model named FUICC Catastrophe Model (FCM) to evaluate the balance of carrying capacity between various urban infrastructures. The development of the model FCM adopts Mean-Variance Analysis (MVA) technique and Catastrophe Progression Method (CPM) collectively. The application of FCM is demonstrated by using the empirical data collected from 35 cities in China. The research findings suggest that: 1) the difference in carrying capacity of each functional infrastructure between the sample cities is significant; 2) the difference in the degree of balance between FUICC is also significant between the sample cities; 3) the sample cities are classified into four categories, namely, acceptably balanced, less balanced, poorly balanced, and unbalanced. 4) the balance performance between FUICC among Chinese cities is characterized with polarization; 5) the balance performance of carrying capacity between functional urban infrastructures is generally poor in China, 40% of the sample cities achieving acceptable performance."
"Does procedural justice climate increase the identification and engagement of migrant workers? A group engagement model perspective Fairness; Social Exchange Theory; Fairness Perceptions Purpose: Migrant workers often suffer from social exclusion in the workplace and therefore identify less with their organization and engage less with their work. To address this issue, the authors integrate research on migrant workers with research on the group engagement model to create a model for understanding and enhancing migrant worker engagement. This allows us to provide insight into how organizations can design their human resource management systems and practices to increase the work engagement of migrant workers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a survey study with over 4,000 employees from more than 500 workplaces in Australia to test the model. Findings: The results of the multilevel analysis indicate that a procedurally fair work environment increases organizational identification, which in turn is associated with higher work engagement. The results also indicate that procedural justice climate is more important for migrant workers and increases their organizational identification and engagement. Originality/value: To increase work engagement of migrant workers, organizations can establish a procedurally fair work environment in which cultural minorities experience unbiased policies and procedures, are able to express their opinions and participate in decision-making."
"Implementation of recycling cigarette butts in lightweight bricks and a proposal for ending the littering of cigarette butts in our cities Tobacco; Smoking; Leachates Our cities, parks, beaches, and oceans have been contaminated for many years with millions of tonnes of unsightly and toxic cigarette butts (CBs). This study presents and discusses some of the results of an ongoing study on recycling in fired-clay bricks. Energy savings: the energy value of CBs with remnant tobacco was found to be 16.5 MJ/kg. If just 2.5% of all bricks produced annually worldwide included 1% CB content, all of the CBs currently produced could be recycled in bricks, and it is estimated that global firing energy consumption could be reduced by approximately 20 billion MJ (megajoules). This approximately equates to the power used by one million homes in Victoria, Australia, every year. Bacteriological study: CBs were investigated for the presence of ten common bacteria in two pilot studies. Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected in fresh used CB samples, and Listeria spp. were detected in old used CB samples. All of the CB samples except the dried sample had significant counts of Bacillus spp. Some species of the detected bacteria in this study are pathogenic. Further confirmation and comprehensive microbiological study are needed in this area. The contact of naphthalene balls with CBs had a significant disinfecting effect on Bacillus spp. The implementation procedure for recycling CBs in bricks, odour from Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions in CBs, sterilization methods, CB collection systems, and safety instructions were investigated, and they are discussed. Proposal: when considering the combined risks from many highly toxic chemicals and possible pathogens in cigarette butts, it is proposed that littering of this waste anywhere in cities and the environment be strictly prohibited and that offenders be heavily fined."
"R&D intensity and income inequality in the G7: 1870–2016 Wage Inequality; Wages; Skill Premium We examine how R&D has contributed to income inequality in the Group of Seven countries from 1870 to 2016. Using newly developed panel data models that incorporate interactive fixed effects, we find that R&D is negatively associated with income inequality. Non-parametric models that allow us to capture the time-varying effect of R&D suggest that this average effect has been negative for most of this period. We find that economic growth and trade are important mechanisms through which R&D transmits to income inequality."
"Superconductivity in intercalated buckled two-dimensional materials: KGe2 Intercalation Compounds; Superconductivity; Graphite Germanene has emerged as a novel two-dimensional material with various interesting properties and applications. Here we report the possibility of superconductivity in a stable potassium intercalated germanene compound, KGe2, with a transition temperature Tc âˆ¼ 11 K, and an electron-phonon coupling of 1.9. Applying a 5% tensile strain, which reduces the buckling height by 4.5%, leads to the reduction of the electron-phonon coupling by 11% and a slight increase in Tc âˆ¼ 12 K. That is, strong electron-phonon coupling results from the buckled structure of the germanene layers. Despite being an intercalated van der Waals material similar to intercalated graphite superconductors, it does not possess an occupied interlayer state."
"Life cycle assessment and cost analysis of fly ash–rice husk ash blended alkali-activated concrete Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali The utilization of industrial and agricultural by-products for the production of alkali activated concrete (AAC) has the potential to yield significant benefits towards sustainability goals. To be a viable material, the construction industry requires a construction material that achieves the requisite strength and the other property requirements as specified in codes and standards while demonstrating improved sustainability criteria. Fly ash and Rice Husk Ash (RHA) are abundantly available waste products, principally located in Asian countries. Currently, a significant proportion of these materials are disposed of in landfills, lagoons and rivers but offer potential to utilize in AAC. Hence, the identification of variables associated with fly ash and fly ah-RHA blended AAC by utilizing fly ash and RHA is vital. This study quantifies the environmental and economic factors by assessing the Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, environmental impacts and benefits, and cost analysis of utilizing fly ash and RHA in AAC compared to Portland Cement (PC) concrete. Alkaline activator is a key component responsible for the highest GHG emission, cost and environmental impact amounts obtained for fly ash geopolymer and blended alkali-activated concrete compared with PC concrete. Alkali activators contribute to 74% of the total GHG emission, while heat curing contributed only 9% to the total GHG emission. The addition of 10% RHA to alkali-activated concrete showed a slight benefit for the analysis. Utilization of waste fly ash and RHA is responsible for providing significant benefits in terms of fresh and marine water ecotoxicity by avoiding waste disposal at the dumpsites, rivers, and storage lagoons."
"Conversion of refuse derived fuel from municipal solid waste into valuable chemicals using advanced thermo-chemical process Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon In this study, thermo-chemical decomposition of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) from municipal solid waste pre-treatment plant has been conducted in pyrolytic conditions. Due to high heterogeneity, individual RDF samples are not necessarily representative of the full variety of different components present. To overcome this, five different samples of RDF with varying compositions were treated in a rotary kiln reactor. RDF feed has been characterized based on the amount of biomass and plastic content. Product (oil & char) composition and quality were analysed using different characterization techniques. It was observed that the quality of pyrolysis products varied with the feed composition and operating temperature. Maximum oil yield of oil âˆ¼43% was obtained from RDF containing âˆ¼77% of plastics at 500 Â°C. This study showed that the interaction of RDF components has a major role in the pyrolysis oil composition. The oil phase mainly consisted of n-aliphatic, branched aliphatic compounds and primary alcohols while, the aqueous phase consisted of organic acids, furans, methanol, phenols, and their derivatives along with ketones. At higher temperatures, the phenolic compounds decreased and the alcohol content was found to increase. Using solvent extraction, phenolic compounds were extracted with hexane while, ketones and acids were extracted using acetone. With high plastic content (âˆ¼85%), the char yield reduced from 55% to 30% with increase in temperature. Char samples consisted of different functional groups such as â€“OH and â€“COOH along with the micronutrients such as K, Mg and P, with pH in the range of 7.8â€“9.5 making it suitable for soil applications. Detailed chemical composition analysis of pyrolysis oil and char is the key to design pyrolysis process and evaluating its importance for producing the value-added chemicals."
"Diversity of dinoflagellate assemblages in coastal temperate and offshore tropical waters of Australia Cyst (Resting Stage); Peridiniales; Alexandrium Minutum Background: Dinoflagellates are a ubiquitous and ecologically important component of marine phytoplankton communities, with particularly notable species including those associated with harmful algal blooms (HABs) and those that bioluminesce. High-throughput sequencing offers a novel approach compared to traditional microscopy for determining species assemblages and distributions of dinoflagellates, which are poorly known especially in Australian waters. Results: We assessed the composition of dinoflagellate assemblages in two Australian locations: coastal temperate Port Phillip Bay and offshore tropical waters of Davies Reef (Great Barrier Reef). These locations differ in certain environmental parameters reflecting latitude as well as possible anthropogenic influences. Molecular taxonomic assessment revealed more species than traditional microscopy, and it showed statistically significant differences in dinoflagellate assemblages between locations. Bioluminescent species and known associates of HABs were present at both sites. Dinoflagellates in both areas were mainly represented by the order Gymnodiniales (66%â€”82% of total sequence reads). In the warm waters of Davies Reef, Gymnodiniales were equally represented by the two superclades, Gymnodiniales sensu stricto (33%) and Gyrodinium (34%). In contrast, in cooler waters of Port Phillip Bay, Gymnodiniales was mainly represented by Gyrodinium (82%). In both locations, bioluminescent dinoflagellates represented up to 0.24% of the total sequence reads, with Protoperidinium the most abundant genus. HAB-related species, mainly represented by Gyrodinium, were more abundant in Port Phillip Bay (up to 47%) than at Davies Reef (28%), potentially reflecting anthropogenic influence from highly populated and industrial areas surrounding the bay. The entire assemblage of dinoflagellates, as well as the subsets of HAB and bioluminescent species, were strongly correlated with water quality parameters (R2 = 0.56â€“0.92). Significant predictors differed between the subsets: HAB assemblages were explained by salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and total dissolved solids; whereas, bioluminescent assemblages were explained only by salinity and dissolved oxygen, and had greater variability. Conclusion: High-throughput sequencing and genotyping revealed greater diversity of dinoflagellate assemblages than previously known in both subtropical and temperate Australian waters. Significant correlations of assemblage structure with environmental variables suggest the potential for explaining the distribution and composition of both HAB species and bioluminescent species."
"Beyond the mainstream: Diversity leadership and leading diversity Feminism; Identity Work; Organization Studies Who runs social work education? What can be said about the representation of diverse groups in leadership in social work education? Leadership theory has for some time recognized more marginal or so-called â€˜standpointâ€™ perspectives, in particular gender and â€˜raceâ€™, that take up a lens beyond the mainstream assumptions of white, male, western leadership. Nevertheless, such theorizing in relation to race/ethnicity and difference has largely been conceptualized as deficit to the white, male norm and accordingly focused on the barriers to inclusion and engagement of minority perspectives. This tendency omits to consider the insights and contributions beyond the mainstream perspectives can bring to leadership styles and strategies. This chapter considers diversity in leadership and leading diversity as two key dimensions. It considers the race/ethnicity axis, and the ways it can shape and craft the perceptions of leaders, the ways in which leadership is enacted and how this relates to actions aimed at leading diversity."
"Recent advances in heterogeneous catalyst design for biorefining Biomass; Levulinic Acids; Ethyl Levulinate Biorefineries are a new concept in chemical manufacturing in which naturally occurring, sustainable biomass resources such as forestry and agricultural waste are converted to diverse fuel and chemical product streams, akin to the processing of non-renewable fossil fuels by petrochemical refineries. Biomass derived from waste agricultural and forestry materials or non-food crops offers the most easily implemented and economical solutions for transportation fuels, and the only nonpetroleum route to organic molecules for the manufacture of bulk, fine, and speciality chemicals necessary to secure the future needs of society. The successful implementation of biorefineries can address concerns over dwindling oil reserves, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel sources and associated climate change, and will be underpinned by catalytic processes to facilitate the co-production of platform chemicals and biofuels. Catalysis is a central theme in sustainable chemistry, lowering energy and resource requirements while minimising waste production. In contrast to fossil-derived crude oil, which has low oxygen content, the high oxygen and water content of biomass feedstocks presents challenges for their utilisation and requires innovations in catalyst and process design for the selective conversion of these hydrophilic, bulky feedstocks into fuels or high-value chemicals. This article highlights how methods to control porosity, solid acid and base character, and surface hydrophobicity are essential components of a toolkit for the design of heterogeneous catalysts for biomass processing."
"Information security burnout: Identification of sources and mitigating factors from security demands and resources Information Security; Protocol Compliance; Computer Security This study examines how information security burnout can develop from complying with organisational security demands, and whether security burnout can be reduced by engaging organisational and personal resources. The Job Demands-Resources model was extended to the IT security context, to develop and empirically test a security burnout model, using a sample of 443 participants in Vietnam. The results demonstrate that security task overload and difficult access to security requirements increased security burnout while dealing with challenging security requirements reduced burnout. Neither organisational resources nor user self-efficacy were effective in reducing burnout. Moreover, simple security tasks did not guarantee a burnout-free experience for users. The findings emphasise the significance of providing resources and designing security tasks as challenging and rewarding experiences, rather than simply reducing user involvement as a source of decreasing cyber security risks. The research establishes a theoretical basis for further studying the phenomenon of security burnout and its role in user security management."
"Manufacturing capital utilisation, firm dynamics and wage inequality Economics; Unskilled Labour; Urban Unemployment This paper examines the short- and long-run effects of manufacturing capital utilisation on income distribution and social welfare of an economy. A rise in manufacturing capital utilisation lowers the effective cost of capital. This increases the demand for capital in the urban sector, which raises firm output and profitability but reduces the availability of capital in the rural sector. Unskilled wage is lowered. Thus, a rise in manufacturing capital utilisation increases income inequality in the short run. In the long run, due to the firm-entry effect, a rise in manufacturing capital utilisation further exacerbates the inequality situation. Empirical analysis confirms the theoretical findings. In particular, a one per cent increase in manufacturing capital utilisation leads to about 0.58% increase in income inequality, of which the contribution from the firm-entry effect is about 28%."
"Transformative Advertising Research: Reimagining the Future of Advertising Marketing; Consumer Culture; Netnography The 50th anniversary of the Journal of Advertising launch is an opportune moment to dialogue among the past, present, and future and offer a fruitful vision for the possibilities of advertising. In this paper, we advance a new subfield that we call transformative advertising research (TAR). TAR examines problems and opportunities across the advertising system with the goal of transforming it toward better outcomes, namely cultivating individual, institutional, and societal well-being. We present a conceptual framework on TAR, informed by institutional theory, that highlights the transformational insights revealed in the intersections and interactions between institutional actors at the micro level, advertising institutions at the meso level, and sociocultural forces at the macro level and the resulting well-being outcomes. To illustrate our framework, we focus on a long-standing topical issue within advertisingâ€”gender inequalityâ€”that holds significant implications for well-being. In conceptualizing advertising as an institution, (1) we propose a new subfield of advertising we name TAR and (2) we present a framework that reveals the system complexities within the advertising ecosystem and allows for a clear vision of potential transformative outcomes, which (3) can guide and inspire scholars and practitioners with directions to engage in social change."
"New therapeutic targets for the prevention of infectious acute exacerbations of COPD: Role of epithelial adhesion molecules and inflammatory pathways Influenza A Virus; Orthomyxoviridae; Human Influenza Chronic respiratory diseases are among the leading causes of mortality worldwide, with the major contributor, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) accounting for approximately 3 million deaths annually. Frequent acute exacerbations (AEs) of COPD (AECOPD) drive clinical and functional decline in COPD and are associated with accelerated loss of lung function, increased mortality, decreased health-related quality of life and significant economic costs. Infections with a small subgroup of pathogens precipitate the majority of AEs and consequently constitute a significant comorbidity in COPD. However, current pharmacological interventions are ineffective in preventing infectious exacerbations and their treatment is compromised by the rapid development of antibiotic resistance. Thus, alternative preventative therapies need to be considered. Pathogen adherence to the pulmonary epithelium through host receptors is the prerequisite step for invasion and subsequent infection of surrounding structures. Thus, disruption of bacterial-host cell interactions with receptor antagonists or modulation of the ensuing inflammatory profile present attractive avenues for therapeutic development. This review explores key mediators of pathogen-host interactions that may offer new therapeutic targets with the potential to prevent viral/bacterial-mediated AECOPD. There are several conceptual and methodological hurdles hampering the development of new therapies that require further research and resolution."
"Mapping geographical inequalities in access to drinking water and sanitation facilities in low-income and middle-income countries, 2000-17 Hygiene; Sanitation; Diarrheal Disease Background: Universal access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities is an essential human right, recognised in the Sustainable Development Goals as crucial for preventing disease and improving human wellbeing. Comprehensive, high-resolution estimates are important to inform progress towards achieving this goal. We aimed to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of access to drinking water and sanitation facilities. Methods: We used a Bayesian geostatistical model and data from 600 sources across more than 88 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to estimate access to drinking water and sanitation facilities on continuous continent-wide surfaces from 2000 to 2017, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. We estimated mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subcategories of facilities for drinking water (piped water on or off premises, other improved facilities, unimproved, and surface water) and sanitation facilities (septic or sewer sanitation, other improved, unimproved, and open defecation) with use of ordinal regression. We also estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths in children younger than 5 years attributed to unsafe facilities and estimated deaths that were averted by increased access to safe facilities in 2017, and analysed geographical inequality in access within LMICs. Findings: Across LMICs, access to both piped water and improved water overall increased between 2000 and 2017, with progress varying spatially. For piped water, the safest water facility type, access increased from 40Â·0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 39Â·4â€“40Â·7) to 50Â·3% (50Â·0â€“50Â·5), but was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to piped water was mostly concentrated in urban centres. Access to both sewer or septic sanitation and improved sanitation overall also increased across all LMICs during the study period. For sewer or septic sanitation, access was 46Â·3% (95% UI 46Â·1â€“46Â·5) in 2017, compared with 28Â·7% (28Â·5â€“29Â·0) in 2000. Although some units improved access to the safest drinking water or sanitation facilities since 2000, a large absolute number of people continued to not have access in several units with high access to such facilities (>80%) in 2017. More than 253 000 people did not have access to sewer or septic sanitation facilities in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, despite 88Â·6% (95% UI 87Â·2â€“89Â·7) access overall. Many units were able to transition from the least safe facilities in 2000 to safe facilities by 2017; for units in which populations primarily practised open defecation in 2000, 686 (95% UI 664â€“711) of the 1830 (1797â€“1863) units transitioned to the use of improved sanitation. Geographical disparities in access to improved water across units decreased in 76Â·1% (95% UI 71Â·6â€“80Â·7) of countries from 2000 to 2017, and in 53Â·9% (50Â·6â€“59Â·6) of countries for access to improved sanitation, but remained evident subnationally in most countries in 2017. Interpretation: Our estimates, combined with geospatial trends in diarrhoeal burden, identify where efforts to increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities are most needed. By highlighting areas with successful approaches or in need of targeted interventions, our estimates can enable precision public health to effectively progress towards universal access to safe water and sanitation.

"Build-to-Rent and the financialization of rental housing: future research directions Foreclosure; Mortgages; Financialization With the expansion of institutional investors into urban rental markets, many cities have witnessed a rise in Build-to-Rent (BtR). This article reviews the financialization of rental housing literature and identifies opportunities for urban housing scholars to progress understandings of BtR through future empirical and theoretical efforts. In particular, it proposes a broadening of the housing research agenda around three analytical entry points. These entry points relate to relatively understudied structural transformations of our urban housing systems implicated in the rise of BtR, namely: (1) the diversification of build-to-sell development models; (2) the evolution of the private rental sector; and (3) labour marketâ€“housing market realignments. Comparative inquiry promises to enrich understandings of BtR by revealing how city rental accommodation and tenancies are recalibrated by the investment imperatives of institutional investors and BtR asset shareholders, and with what benefits and at what costs to whom. Such contributions will also provide rich data to progress conceptual efforts to locate BtR within broader processes of housing financialization."
"Metal Alloys for Fusion-Based Additive Manufacturing Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Metal additive manufacturing (AM) is an innovative manufacturing technique, which builds parts incrementally layer by layer. Thus, metal AM has inherent advantages in part complexity, time, and waste saving. However, due to its complex thermal cycle and rapid solidification during processing, the alloys well suit and commercially used for metal AM today are limited. Therefore, it is important to understand the alloying strategy and current progress with materials performance to consider alloy development for metal AM. This review presents the current range of alloys available for metal AM, including titanium, steel, nickel, aluminum, less common alloys (including Mg alloys, metal matrix composites alloys, and low melting point alloys), and compositionally complex alloys (including bulk metallic glasses and high entropy alloys) with a focus on the relationship between compositions, processing, microstructures, and properties of each alloy system. In addition, some promising alloy systems for metal AM are highlighted. Approaches for designing and optimizing new materials for metal AM have been summarized."
"A multi-country study of image-based sexual abuse: extent, relational nature and correlates of victimisation experiences Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica This study examined image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) victimisation in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand (n = 6,109). Findings showed that 37.7% (n = 2,306) of respondents had at least one IBSA victimisation experience since 16 years of age. Logistic regression analyses further identified that demographic characteristics (age, sexuality, disability/assistance), attitudes towards IBSA, and experiential variables (online dating and sexual self-image behaviours, IBSA perpetration) were each predictors of IBSA victimisation. Though gender did not predict the overall extent of IBSA victimisation, the relational contexts and impacts of IBSA remained gendered in particular ways. Implications of the study are discussed with respect to conceptualising gendered violence and future research. PRACTICE IMPACT STATEMENT: This article demonstrates both the diversity of victim experiences of image-based sexual abuse (IBSA), as well as gendered and other patterns in the relational contexts in which it occurs. The findings presented here may assist researchers and practitioners by promoting understanding of the diverse contexts of IBSA, and in turn informing policy, response options and ultimately prevention of IBSA victimisation targeted for different abuse experiences."
"Mapping the knowledge domain of stakeholder perspective studies in construction projects: A bibliometric approach Construction Industry; Project-based Organizations; Office Management Construction projects require the effective collaboration among the various types of stakeholders involved to succeed, thus leading to stakeholder perspective studies in construction projects. The study proposes an integrated bibliometric approach to detect the knowledge evolution, domain and frontier with a broader searching scope compared with manual review. A total of 752 peer-reviewed academic papers published until the end of 2017 are used. The knowledge evolution indicates seven milestones in history, namely, stakeholder concept, method, identification, assessment, management, influence and complexity. The identified knowledge domain consists of four major research areas which are society, sustainability, analytical tool and project management. The knowledge frontier is also revealed, including a dearth of detailed discussions on stakeholder engagement in sustainable urban projects, lack of generalisation of stakeholder studies in complex construction projects, limited application of dynamic and simulation stakeholder analysis in uncertain project environment and few instant and accurate approaches to integrate stakeholder information. The study provides a holistic knowledge map for the past, current and future of stakeholder perspective studies in construction projects."
"Multivariate selection mediated by aridity predicts divergence of drought-resistant traits along natural aridity gradients of an invasive weed Erythranthe Guttata; Germination; Flowering Date Geographical variation in the environment underpins selection for local adaptation and evolutionary divergence among populations. Because many environmental conditions vary across species' ranges, identifying the specific environmental variables underlying local adaptation is profoundly challenging. We tested whether natural selection mediated by aridity predicts clinal divergence among invasive populations of capeweed (Arctotheca calendula) that established and spread across southern Australia during the last two centuries. Using common garden experiments with two environmental treatments (wet and dry) that mimic aridity conditions across capeweedâ€™s invasive range, we estimated clinal divergence and effects of aridity on fitness and multivariate phenotypic selection in populations sampled along aridity gradients in Australia. We show that: (1) capeweed populations have relatively high fitness in aridity environments similar to their sampling locations; (2) the magnitude and direction of selection strongly differs between wet and dry treatments, with drought stress increasing the strength of selection; and (3) differences in directional selection between wet and dry treatments predict patterns of clinal divergence across the aridity gradient, particularly for traits affecting biomass, flowering phenology and putative antioxidant expression. Our results suggest that aridity-mediated selection contributes to trait diversification among invasive capeweed populations, possibly facilitating the expansion of capeweed across southern Australia."
"Survey and analysis of consumers’ behaviour for electronic waste management in Bangladesh E-Waste; Electronic Waste; Electronic Equipment This paper aims to establish consumer's perception of electric waste recycling and management on a national scale in Bangladesh. The attitude, willingness to pay (WTP) and consumers' behaviour were explored by conducting a questionnaire-based survey. The conclusions are based on 915 valid responses out of 2000 online survey invitations. Interestingly, 37.9% of the respondents indicated that they would accept to pay for electronic waste recycling. Analysis also shows that the preferred WTP would cover 5â€“10% of the recycling cost. Factors like environmental awareness, monthly income, and education level affect the consumers' WTP. Nevertheless, most of the participants believe that the Government should share the recycling cost. The study suggests that e-waste recycling can be stimulated by promoting environmental awareness, educating the public about the benefits of recycling e-waste, and making e-waste recycling more convenient. However, additional measures will likely be needed to tackle the e-waste problem. Thus, support for environmental education is imperative in order to promote environmental awareness and increase the WTP of consumers. The study outlines key characteristics of consumer-focused e-waste management archetypes and proposes an effective road map for Bangladesh."
"The Effects of Rabbit Manure-Derived Biochar on Soil Health and Quality Attributes of Two Mine Tailings Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Biochar amendment is becoming a promising technology for mining soil restoration. The addition of biochar can improve soil microbiological parameters related to soil quality, such as enzyme activities. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the effect of rabbit manure (RM) and two rabbit manure biochars prepared at two pyrolysis temperatures (300 and 600 Â°C) on the biochemical properties of two mining soils in the Portman area (Spain) in the presence or absence of vegetation. Soils were amended with the RM, the two biochars and a mixture of the rabbit manure and biochars (50/50 w/w) at a rate of 10% in a mesocosms experiment to study the changes in dehydrogenase, phosphomonoesterase, Î²-glucosidase activities, geometric mean of enzyme activities (GMea) and soil microbial biomass (SMB). Changes in individual enzyme activities were not always consistent. However, when using the GMea as a measure of soil quality, our results showed an increase in the GMea (217â€“360 times) after the addition of rabbit manure to mining soils, while this increase was from 81â€“270 times following the addition of rabbit manure with biochar prepared at 300 Â°C. Therefore, the use of biochar prepared at low temperatures could be a promising direction for the improvement of soil quality and soil carbon sequestration."
"Does bank competition promote financial inclusion? A cross-country evidence Bank Lending Channel; Loans; Credit Rationing The idea of financial inclusion has recently been discussed as one of the key strategies to enhance economic development (World Bank 2014). We move this discussion forward by examining if bank competition is a crucial component enforcing financial inclusion, which is arguably a finance supply-side driven process. In this study, we compute the financial inclusion index built on Sarma (2008) approach to better reflect banksâ€™ willingness and capability to provide financial services. Applying System Generalized Method of Moments to the panel of 93 countries, we find that bank competition promotes financial inclusion."
"Preparation and study of magnesium ammonium phosphate cement from waste lithium slag Magnesium Phosphates; Cements; Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate Due to the recent surge in the lithium slat industry, a high amount of lithium slag (LS) is generated as industrial waste and stacked open, causing environmental pollution and occupying land resources. In this regard, this research very first time investigates the use of LS to prepare and study the physical and mechanical properties of magnesium ammonium phosphate cement (MAPC). It is believed that results will be helpful in reducing the burden of LS on the environment and in improving the construction sector sustainability. For this purpose, LS was replaced with the MAPC by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%. A gradual increase in LS quantity decreased the fluidity and increased the setting time of LS-MAPC mortars. Comparison of results showed that heat curing of samples at 70 Â°C for 24 h produced LS-MAPC mortars having high strength than the air-curing. Among all mixtures, a replacement level of 10% was found as the optimum dosage and produced the best results as compared to other mixtures. Mechanical properties of LS-MAPC mortars were improved when amount of MAPC replacement by LS was 10%. Water absorption and porosity of mortars showed a direct relationship with the percentage of LS. Reaction products were studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscope analysis and their findings corroborated with experimental results."
"Research on Pear Tree Flowering Period Prediction Method Based on Neural Network Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Phenology; Climate Change Plant phenotype is all physical, physiological, biochemical characteristics and traits that reflect the entire process of plant structural composition, growth and development. Timely phenotypic observation of plants is of great significance in terms of crop safety and environmental sustainability. Aiming at the problems of inaccurate flowering time prediction, time-consuming and waste of energy prediction in traditional pear tree phenotype observation, this paper studies the flowering prediction method of pear tree plants based on PCA-BP neural network. Taking pear tree as the research object, the meteorological observation data of Shijiazhuang Meteorological Station was analyzed by principal component analysis method, then three principal components with large correlation with pear flowering period were obtained. BP neural network model was introduced into the pear tree flowering period prediction and the error was reduced to one day, then."
"Four days of simulated shift work reduces insulin sensitivity in humans Cryptochromes; Clock; Suprachiasmatic Nucleus Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 4 consecutive simulated night shifts on glucose homeostasis, mitochondrial function and central and peripheral rhythmicities compared with a simulated day shift schedule. Methods: Seventeen healthy adults (8M:9F) matched for sleep, physical activity and dietary/fat intake participated in this study (night shift work n = 9; day shift work n = 8). Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity before and after 4 nights of shift work were measured by an intravenous glucose tolerance test and a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp respectively. Muscles biopsies were obtained to determine insulin signalling and mitochondrial function. Central and peripheral rhythmicities were assessed by measuring salivary melatonin and expression of circadian genes from hair samples respectively. Results: Fasting plasma glucose increased (4.4 Â± 0.1 vs. 4.6 Â± 0.1 mmol Lâˆ’1; P =.001) and insulin sensitivity decreased (25 Â± 7%, P <.05) following the night shift, with no changes following the day shift. Night shift work had no effect on skeletal muscle protein expression (PGC1Î±, UCP3, TFAM and mitochondria Complex II-V) or insulin-stimulated pAkt Ser473, pTBC1D4Ser318 and pTBC1D4Thr642. Importantly, the metabolic changes after simulated night shifts occurred despite no changes in the timing of melatonin rhythmicity or hair follicle cell clock gene expression across the wake period (Per3, Per1, Nr1d1 and Nr1d2). Conclusion: Only 4 days of simulated night shift work in healthy adults is sufficient to reduce insulin sensitivity which would be expected to increase the risk of T2D."
"A Survey on Trajectory Data Management, Analytics, and Learning Visual Analytics; Cluster Analysis; Pattern Mining Recent advances in sensor and mobile devices have enabled an unprecedented increase in the availability and collection of urban trajectory data, thus increasing the demand for more efficient ways to manage and analyze the data being produced. In this survey, we comprehensively review recent research trends in trajectory data management, ranging from trajectory pre-processing, storage, common trajectory analytic tools, such as querying spatial-only and spatial-Textual trajectory data, and trajectory clustering. We also explore four closely related analytical tasks commonly used with trajectory data in interactive or real-Time processing. Deep trajectory learning is also reviewed for the first time. Finally, we outline the essential qualities that a trajectory data management system should possess to maximize flexibility."
"Machine Learning for Electrocatalyst and Photocatalyst Design and Discovery Neural Networks; Potential Energy Surfaces; Materials Science Electrocatalysts and photocatalysts are key to a sustainable future, generating clean fuels, reducing the impact of global warming, and providing solutions to environmental pollution. Improved processes for catalyst design and a better understanding of electro/photocatalytic processes are essential for improving catalyst effectiveness. Recent advances in data science and artificial intelligence have great potential to accelerate electrocatalysis and photocatalysis research, particularly the rapid exploration of large materials chemistry spaces through machine learning. Here a comprehensive introduction to, and critical review of, machine learning techniques used in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis research are provided. Sources of electro/photocatalyst data and current approaches to representing these materials by mathematical features are described, the most commonly used machine learning methods summarized, and the quality and utility of electro/photocatalyst models evaluated. Illustrations of how machine learning models are applied to novel electro/photocatalyst discovery and used to elucidate electrocatalytic or photocatalytic reaction mechanisms are provided. The review offers a guide for materials scientists on the selection of machine learning methods for electrocatalysis and photocatalysis research. The application of machine learning to catalysis science represents a paradigm shift in the way advanced, next-generation catalysts will be designed and synthesized."
"ADR practice in planning conflicts: Australian lawyers’ thinking on ADR, training and mentorship Alternative Dispute Resolution; Dissent And Disputes; Experienced Mediator Lawyersâ€™ alternative dispute resolution (ADR) practice is an important part of legal practice and education. In this research project, we explored the views of planning lawyers in Melbourne, Australia who were engaged in the ADR processes of mediation and compulsory conferencing. The participants interviewed endorsed the use of ADR in planning disputes and spoke of the need to adopt a collaborative approach drawing on their negotiation and communication skills. They also spoke of their role providing legal expertise in a complex jurisdiction. The lawyers reflected on the nature of planning disputes where conflict can be emotional as disputes deal with the communitiesâ€™ lived experience of the built environment and the wider concerns of the planning of cities. The lawyers showed the ability to focus on the larger justice issues that affect the jurisdiction. Additionally, the study explored the lawyersâ€™ views on their training in ADR. While some participants appreciated ADR training courses, many pointed to the benefits of learning from those lawyers experienced in planning law disputes. The research presented here suggests the need for ongoing peer support and mentorship for lawyers in the use of ADR, in addition to training, that is particular to their jurisdiction."
"Photodegradation of emerging contaminants in a sunlit wastewater lagoon, seasonal measurements, environmental impacts and modelling Dissolved Organic Matter; Photodegradation; Water The seasonal sunlight-induced photodegradation of seven emerging contaminants (ECs) in a municipal wastewater treatment lagoon was examined in a lab-scale study over a year. There were obvious seasonal trends for the degradation rates of all the ECs in both ultrapure water and lagoon wastewater matrices with strong correlations (R2 = 0.65-0.90) between sunlight irradiance and their degradation rates in pure water, indicating the dominant influence of natural sunlight intensity. This suggests the importance of recording light source conditions for the purposes of data interpretation and modelling of sunlight-induced photolysis. It was demonstrated that photolysis of these ECs was likely to occur only within the first 10 cm of the lagoon surface. Strongly temperature dependent photodegradation was observed for the five ECs which primarily underwent indirect photolysis in the lagoon wastewater, and activation energy values (which could be used for simulation of the photodegradation process) were obtained for these compounds. The quantum yields of the ECs were determined under wastewater-relevant pH conditions. The APEX environmental model was adjusted to simulate the photodegradation of these ECs in the lagoon wastewater. The predicted results were largely in agreement with the seasonal measurements, with some overestimated photodegradation rates obtained for winter, suggesting that temperature should be included as a factor for modelling the photolysis of ECs. These results indicate that there is potential to establish a model to predict the photodegradation of a wide range of ECs in wastewater treatment lagoons to facilitate risk assessment of the treated wastewater."
"Reinvestigate the Bid-Ask Bounce Effect and Pricing of Idiosyncratic Volatility: The Case of the Australian Market Momentum Strategies; Overreaction; Momentum We investigate the bid-ask bounce effect on estimation of idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) from asset pricing perspective using a comprehensive country-specific sample. We find that the idiosyncratic volatility-return relationship remains significant while controlling for stock size. However, the explanatory power of IVOL disappears completely when stock liquidity is controlled for. These findings support our argument that the bid-ask bounce effect on pricing of IVOL is strongly influenced by stock liquidity. Our results indicate that mid-price is the ""true"" price to measure IVOL of the least liquid stocks in the Australian stock market."
"Stories of employability: improving interview narratives with image-supported past-behaviour storytelling training Impression Management; Job Interview; Applicant Purpose: Stories of employability are told in employment and educational settings, notably the selection interviews. A popular training approach guiding higher education students to construct employability stories has been the past-behaviour storytelling method. However, insufficient research exists regarding the method's effectiveness and optimisation. This study examines whether the method (1) increases the quantity and quality of interview narratives in story forms and (2) can be enhanced by image stimuli. Design/methodology/approach: In a double-blind randomised control trial with repeated measures, participants submitted four weekly interview narratives. After receiving past-behaviour serious storytelling training in Week 3, they were randomly allocated to an exposure group using images and a control group using keywords as a placebo to continue producing interview narratives. The interview narratives were assessed based on the number of stories and quality ratings of narrative conformity, relevance and conciseness. Results before and after the training, and with and without the image stimuli, were analysed. Findings: Training increased the number of stories. Training and repeated practice also increased narrative quality ratings. However, the image-based intervention was the strongest predictor of improved quality ratings (effect size 2.47 points on the observed scale of 0â€“10, p < 0.01, 95% CI [1.46, 3.47]). Practical implications: A pre-existing ability to tell employability stories cannot be assumed. Training is necessary, and intervention is required for enhancement. Multi-sensory narrative interventions may be considered. Originality/value: This study is the first known double-blind randomised control trial with repeated measures evaluating if storytelling training and image stimuli improve interview narratives."
"Megacity Dhaka: ‘water security syndrome’ and implications for the scholarship of sustainability Sleuths; Cellular Automaton Model; Urbanization The potentials of the scholarship of sustainability present new possibilities for integrated analysis to address syndromes in human-environment systems. A syndrome here means a big-picture complex problem or issue with sustainability implications, such as urban sprawl, land contamination, mass tourism, waste dumping, etc. Through a case historyâ€”that of a â€˜water security syndromeâ€™â€”this paper explores key conceptual aspects for the potential scholarship of sustainability. First, it outlines the scope of this syndrome within the context of one megacity, Dhaka (Bangladesh). Through a holistic literature analysis utilizing systemâ€™s approach six themes are then elucidated, including patterns of change, sectoral impacts, climate change implications, and opportunities to capitalize. A model is constructed representing a â€˜water security syndromeâ€™ in the perspective of developing world, and implications are drawn for the potential scholarship of sustainability."
"Do University Libraries in Australia Actively Plan to Protect Special Collections from Disaster? Disaster Planning; COVID-19; Archivists Despite the increasing digitalisation of special collections, Australian university libraries continue to house tangible original works contributing to collective state, national and global heritage. The protection of special collections relates to the international aspirations provided by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015â€“2030 Priority 3. Currently over five hundred separately grouped university library special collections are recorded in Australia. Globally, there is limited research into university librarian comprehension of how to plan for the protection of special collections. A survey targeted the 35 Australian university libraries identified for inclusion in the study, via the Council for Australian University Librarians (CAUL) database. Eleven (31%) responses qualified for analysis. Of the respondents, the findings include 92% hold tangible special collections as part of their university library collection; 90% do not have a specific plan for the protection of special collections and 90% have experienced a disaster event at some point in their library career. The research concludes that special collections held by Australian universities are at risk and that the role of the university librarian is undervalued in the global efforts to protect cultural and historical heritage in the event of a disaster."
"CIRCULAR DESIGN IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH Wood Flour; Informality; Acacia One Planet Sustainable Buildings and Construction Programme (SBC), led by the Ministry of the Environment, Finland and co-led by RMIT University and UN Environment Programme was initiated in 2015. Work on circular built environments commenced in the second iteration of the programmeâ€™s work plan. SBC was the first global programme that worked on circularity and responsibly sourced materials in the buildings and construction sector. In 2020, the SBC programme published a range of reports focusing on the state of play for circular built environments across specific regions, tied together with a global report. The present focus of the programme is on Africa, Asia and Latin America, where case studies are collected following a common framework. These case studies together with a global survey provide reliable performance data for responsibly sourced building materials in the Global South. The underpinning premise through this process is to support related SDGs across the social, environmental, and economic considerations and enable countries to achieve their targets under the Paris Agreement. This paper presents key findings from this study, largely derived through case studies in the Global South. The results show that not all stages of the building life cycle are addressed through local examples."
"Characterization for Cleaner and Sustainable Production of Glycerol from Tallow Under Aqueous Media at High Pressure and Temperature Transesterification; Catalyst; Rubber Seed Oil Tallow fat is used in pharmaceuticals and also as raw material for the synthesis of glycerine which is used in oleo-chemical industries. In this study, steam-hydrolysis of animal tallow has been carried out to obtain glycerol by high pressure, temperature hydrolysis method without catalyst. The effect of process parameters such as feed ratio and temperature on the production of glycerol by hydrolysis has been studied. The beef tallow has been characterized by TGA for thermal stability where it shows slight decomposition in three stages: 59 Â°C, 187 Â°C, and 293 Â°C leaving 80.96% residue. H1 NMR profile shows doublet-of-doublets arising from two methylene groups and a multiplet for the CH-proton. 13C-NMR of the product demonstrated signals at 62.58 and 72.11 ppm, indicating the presence of the aliphatic carbon in the 1Â°- and 2Â°-alcohol of the final product glycerol. The 1:4 blend of (water to tallow) under 256 Â°C and 60 bar pressure has been recorded as an optimal operating condition (non-catalytic) to yield a degree of hydrolysis of 98.4%. The degree FTIR analysis shows a peak at 3300 cmâˆ’1 due to the presence of water and glycerol which in turn indicates the presence of glycerol."
"Values and cognitive mechanisms: Comparing the predictive factors of Australian meat intake Vegetarians; Vegan Diet; Meat Recent studies have found values for animal-welfare, personal-health and the environment to be the main factors motivating veg*n diets. However, studies are yet to simultaneously compare these values between Australian meat-eaters, vegetarians, and vegans, and therefore, the extent to which they motivate these groups. Further, while cognitive mechanisms (methods of reducing the psychological discomfort of eating meat while holding such values) have been found to facilitate meat intake, these mechanisms are yet to be compared against values in their ability to predict meat consumption. In the current study, meat-eaters reported the lowest concern for animal-welfare, personal-health, and the environment. With the exception of personal-health, vegans reported the greatest concern for these factors. However, cognitive mechanisms predicted meat consumption more strongly than these values. These findings may have implications for reducing meat consumption and improving outcomes for animal-welfare, public health and the environment."
"Assessing the effectiveness for achieving policy objectives of land consolidation in china: Evidence from project practices in jiangsu province from 2001 to 2017 Land Consolidation; Agriculture; Cadastres Land consolidation (LC) is an important measure taken to increase the quantity and productivity of farmland while reducing land fragmentation and ensuring food security. However, long-term land consolidation project (LCP) practices are rarely analyzed to assess the effectiveness for achieving current policy objectives of LC in China. Taking the practices of LCPs in Jiangsu Province from 2001 to 2017 as a case study, we used the spatial self-related analysis, the consistency analysis, and the redundant analysis (RDA), and found that the construction scale and the investment amount of LC in Jiangsu Province displayed varying trends, and that the newly increased farmland rate is clearly divided into three stages and gradually decreases. The newly increased farmland area, the investment funds, and reserved land resources for farmlands are not spatially synchronized in Jiangsu Province. Only the positive relationship between the LC rate and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) growth rate continue to rise. The earlier stage of land consolidation projects (LCPs)â€™s practices is mainly affected by natural and social factors, and the late stage is mainly affected by economic and strategic factors. Finally, a new implementation scheme framework of LC planning has been proposed. This framework provides reference for top-level design, planning, and management of LC policies at the national level in China and other developing countries."
"The impact of natural disasters on migration: Findings from Vietnam Climate Change; Decision to Migrate; Small Islands Increasingly, studies are examining whether the incidence of natural disasters influences household migration. This paper examines whether the severity of natural disasters is important for migration decisions in Vietnam, rather than just examining their occurrence. Data for a sample of 1,003 farm households from the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey are examined for the period 2006-2008. A residual generated regressor approach is adopted to isolate the direct impact of disasters on migration from the indirect impact they have on migration through reducing agricultural output and income. Findings suggest that more severe disasters are directly associated with a greater probability of migration. Furthermore, such outcomes are the same for poor households vis-Ã -vis their non-poor counterparts."
"Mining in Papua New Guinea: A complex story of trends, impacts and governance Papua New Guinea; Resource Extraction; Mining Mining is often portrayed as a contributor to sustainable development, especially so in developing countries such as Papua New Guinea (PNG). Since 1970, several large mines have been developed in PNG (e.g. Panguna, Ok Tedi, Porgera, Lihir, Ramu) but always with controversial environmental standards and social impacts often overlooked or ignored. In PNG, mine wastes are approved to be discharged to rivers or oceans on a very large scale, leading to widespread environmental and social impacts â€“ to the point of civil war in the case of Panguna. The intimate links between indigenous communities and their environment have invariably been under-estimated or ignored, leading many to question mining's role in PNG's development. Here, we review the geology of PNG, its mineral resources, mining history, key trends for grades and resources, environmental metrics (water, energy, carbon), mine waste management, and regulatory and governance issues. The study provides a unique and comprehensive insight into the sustainable development contribution of the mining industry in PNG â€“ especially the controversial practices of riverine and marine mine waste disposal. The history of mining is a complex story of the links between the anthroposphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and geosphere. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that the scale of environmental and social impacts and risks are clearly related to the vast scale of mine wastes â€“ a fact which remains been poorly recognised. For PNG, the promise of mining-led development remains elusive to many communities and they are invariably left with significant social and environmental legacies which will last for decades to centuries (e.g. mine waste impacts on water resources). Most recently, the PNG government has moved to ban riverine tailings disposal for future projects and encourage greater transparency and accountability by the mining sector, including its interactions with communities. There remains hope for better outcomes in the future."
"Towards action research with trans women sex workers: Policy, space and social challenges Gender Dysphoria; Transgender Persons; Transsexualism Trans women face multiple social, economic and health inequalities and the impact of gender oppression and violence is even more profoundly experienced by trans women sex workers, although in culturally specific ways. This paper presents a pilot study conducted to explore and engage with the context of trans women sex workers in Lido Tre Archi, Italy. In line with the community psychology values of social justice, social change and participation, we outline our engagement process and key challenges observed when attempting action research with such a highly marginalised group. Data were collected in the form of ethnographic notes from informal consultations with different stakeholders and participant observations, and of documents (newspaper articles, picture captions) and were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings are organised in three themes relating to the social, policy and physical context in Lido Tre Archi demonstrating evidence of the contextual challenges and how they intertwine to generate a spiral of marginalisation and social exclusion for the participants. We take a collaborative and reflexive stance in our work and conclude with recommended steps and potential limitations to initiate an action research project."
"Recent advances in the construction of sustainable asphalt roads with recycled plastic Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens Although various polyolefins have intermittently been used for making roads since the 1980s, the recycling of plastic waste into roads raises new challenges related to the production, performance and durability of plastic-modified asphalt. This review critically discusses the challenges of incorporating recycled plastics into bitumen/asphalt in terms of plastic selection, chemical compatibility, long-term performance and potential contributions to fuming, microplastic pollution and contaminant leaching. Recent advances in the field are also presented and recommendations for future work to address current research and industrial gaps are suggested. Challenges related to the construction of plastic roads include the wide variability in the plastic composition and its properties after recycling, which not only affect the successful incorporation of plastic in bitumen but also impact the mechanical properties and environmental impact of the roads. The lack of representative testing procedures prevents an accurate understanding of the short- and long-term performance of plastic roads in real conditions and the contribution of plastic roads to fuming and microplastic release remains unclear. However, promising laboratory-based procedures have been developed to benchmark the release of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds, as well as microplastics, from recycled plastic-modified asphalt against conventional polymer-modified asphalts. Standards are still required to facilitate bitumen/asphalt modification by recycled plastics, meet the needs of bitumen/asphalt manufacturers and convince local authorities to foster the construction of plastic roads if proven to be a sustainable practice.

"Language and communication issues in HIV/AIDS intervention management in the South African construction industry: Interview survey findings AIDS/HIV; Child Mortality; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Purpose: Effective communication is a key factor in presenting Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) awareness and prevention campaigns, and delivering treatment programmes, particularly in South Africa where different ethnic groups and a diversity of languages and educational attainment levels are encountered. Language is an important element of such communication. The purpose of this paper is to examine the communication effectiveness of AIDS-related intervention messages. Design/methodology/approach: Case-based semi-structured interviews, with 42 employees from three construction organisations, and with six telephone counsellors from a service provider, were used to explore language in the HIV/AIDS context in the construction industry in the Western Cape region. Findings: Workersâ€™ knowledge about HIV (a key element in prevention and willingness to engage in treatment regimes) tended to align with their level of education. African cultures may inhibit the use of plain language about AIDS. Graphic posters with text in different languages were the most preferred communication media, but need periodic refreshment to remain effective. For toolbox talks and other company presentations, a comprehensive approach to language differences is limited, and appropriate confirmatory feedback loops are not used â€“ the message sent is not always the message received. The recruitment and training processes for service provider counsellors ensure a more comprehensive grasp of HIV knowledge and a more consistent approach to communication. Practical implications: Construction organisations should be more careful in their HIV/AIDS campaigns and programmes, ensure better targeting of audiences and pay more nuanced and sensitive attention to language needs, gender differences and cultural contexts with respect to communicating with workers in ways that engage them more fully about HIV/AIDS, stigma and disclosure. Originality/value: Communication effectiveness is pivotal in the provision of intervention management by construction firms. Ineffective language and communication processes directly and adversely influence HIV/AIDS intervention management success."
"A Review on the Research and Development of Solar-Assisted Heat Pump for Buildings in China Air Source Heat Pumps; Solar; Solar Heating The building sector accounts for over 40% of global energy consumption.

Thirdly, the application of SAHPs in practical projects is examined and relevant regulations, standards, and policies for solar-assisted heat pump development in China are highlighted. Finally, recommendations for the future development of solar-assisted heat pumps in China are suggested."
"Ecosystem dynamics: exploring the interplay within fintech entrepreneurial ecosystems Crowdfunding; Lending; Fintech Scholars and practitioners continue to recognize the crucial role of entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) in creating a conducive environment for productive entrepreneurship. Although EEs are fundamentally interaction systems of hierarchically independent yet mutually dependent actors, few studies have investigated how interactions among ecosystem actors drive the entrepreneurial process. Seeking to address this gap, this paper explores how ecosystem actor interactions influence new ventures in the financial technology (fintech) EE of Singapore. Guided by an EE framework and the use of an exploratory-abductive approach, empirical data from semi-structured interviews is collected and analyzed. The findings reveal four categories representing both the relational perspective, which features interaction and intermediation dynamics, and the cultural perspective, which encompasses ecosystem development and regulatory dynamics. These categories help explain how and why opportunity identification and resource exploitation are accelerated or inhibited for entrepreneurs in fintech EEs. The present study provides valuable contributions to scholars and practitioners interested in EEs and contributes to the academic understanding of the emerging fintech phenomenon."
"Enduring silence: racialized news values, white supremacy and a national apology for child sexual abuse Peace; Sexual Abuse; Rape This article examines news coverage of Australia's 2018 National Apology to Victims of Institutional Child Sexual Abuse to reveal how conventional news values and practices produce racialised hierarchies of media attention that routinely position whiteness at the pinnacle. Via content analysis of media coverage, informed by critical discourse analysis, we focus on whether news reporting of the Apology reflected the Royal Commission's stated commitment, care and attention to ensuring First Nations people, who were over-represented among victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, were afforded voice and agency in media. The coverage was remarkable for its failure to connect the 2018 Apology to the 2008 Apology to the Stolen Generations, or to ongoing concerns regarding high rates of Indigenous child removal and over-incarceration. Overall, we argue that news values and routines work to structure media representation through logics of white supremacy and relegating colonial violence to the past."
"‘I can put my culture on my t-shirt’: The value of design and enterprise in Ntaria Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work In the Aboriginal community of Ntaria, visual communication is utilized to enhance storytelling, kinship relationships, and cultural knowledge. This research investigates how digital design tools could generate new forms of representation and connection while leading to the creation of employment pathways for young adults. Detailed in this paper is how Ntaria Design, a student-led enterprise was cultivated through a design and enterprise education program run at Ntaria School, part of a three-year participatory action study. From a Western Arrarnta perspective, the value of design, and the resulting development of a design-based enterprise was mediated by Country, culture, and community. This in turn necessitated new ways of teaching, learning, and engaging in research together on-Country. The establishment of Ntaria Design illuminates how design education can build entrepreneurial capacity while enabling Aboriginal youth to engage in commercial pathways on their own terms, and according to their own life-worlds."
"Prosperity for the poor: Religion, poverty and development in Sub-Saharan Africa Pentecostal; Prosperity Gospel; Christianity In this chapter, the authors present a much-needed discussion on the role of religion in the development process in Sub-Saharan Africa. The authors invoke the case of the very popular Pentecostal prosperity gospel doctrine, a â€œreligious policyâ€ on poverty alleviation that promises material wealth and health to all believers through faith and monetary offerings to God (church). The authors examine how this doctrine is shaping local imaginations of poverty, and the moral agency of pursuing wealth in the market economy, as well as the ethics and apologetics of the doctrineâ€™s material costs. The chapter therefore presents a useful invitation to development stakeholders and researchers to take religion more seriously in the conversation on development and poverty alleviation in Africa."
"An iterative nonlinear filter using variational Bayesian optimization Cubature; Kalman Filter; Maneuvering Target Tracking We propose an iterative nonlinear estimator based on the technique of variational Bayesian optimization. The posterior distribution of the underlying system state is approximated by a solvable variational distribution approached iteratively using evidence lower bound optimization subject to a minimal weighted Kullback-Leibler divergence, where a penalty factor is considered to adjust the step size of the iteration. Based on linearization, the iterative nonlinear filter is derived in a closed-form. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with several nonlinear filters in the literature using simulated target tracking examples."
"A focused review on membrane contactors for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) effluents Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling The need for a more sustainable wastewater treatment is more relevant now due to climate change. Production and reuse of methane from anaerobic treatment is one pathway. However, this is defeated by the presence of dissolved methane in the effluent and would be released to the environment, adding to the greenhouse gas emissions. This review paper provided summary and analysis of studies involved in the production of dissolved methane from AnMBR, focusing with actual methane measurement (gas and dissolved) from AnMBR with different types of wastewater. Then more focused discussion and analysis on the use of membrane-based technology or membrane contactors in the recovery of dissolved methane from AnMBR effluent are included, with its development and energy analysis. The dissolved methane removal and recovery rate of membrane contactors can be as high as 96% and 0.05 mol methane/m2/h, respectively, with very low additional energy requirement of 0.01 kWh/m3 for the recovery. Future perspectives presented focus on the long-term evaluation and modelling of membrane contactors and on the membrane modifications to improve the selectivity of membranes to methane and to limit their fouling and wetting, thus making the technology more economical for resource recovery."

The key attributes possessed by such a globally relevant talent pool for the workforce of the future include basic digital skills and literacy; learnability skills; skills needed for greening economies; skills required for engaging in Industry 4.0 occupations; skills for next-generation infrastructure and services; skills for technology-infused manufacturing sectors; and broad-based soft skills that help to improve workplace effectiveness, such as skills for teamwork, problem-solving, creativity, and design-thinking. All these will have an important and far-reaching impact on future directions for technical and vocational education and training in the region that policy makers and practitioners need to take into account."
"The sociology of compensation inequality in upper-echelon positions: evidence from Australia Director; Corporate Governance; Board Independence This paper explores the sociology of gender pay equality in leadership positions. Using a large compensation dataset, we examine the impact of gender pay inequality among directors and executives on firm performance. Based on a triangulation research design, quantitative outcomes are supplemented with semi-structured interviews to study compensation expectations, negotiation skills and gender differences in teamwork on boards of directors. The findings show that remuneration transparency is becoming the norm. However, compensation inequalities still exist and undermine performance. The results indicate that diversity targets or specific policies regarding equality and equity of opportunity are insufficient if they are not supported by a cultural understanding and the application of equitable policies and procedures throughout the organisation."
"How urban forest managers evaluate management and governance challenges in their decision-making Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Decisions about urban forests are critical to urban liveability and resilience. This study aimed to evaluate the range of positions held by urban forest managers from local governments in the state of Victoria, Australia, regarding the management and governance challenges that affect their decision-making. This study was based on a Q-method approach, a procedure that allows researchers to evaluate the range of positions that exist about a topic in a structured manner based on the experiences of a wide group of people. We created statements on a wide range of urban forest management and governance challenges and asked urban forest managers to rate their level of agreement with these statements via an online survey. Managers generally agreed about the challenges posed by urban development and climate change for implementing local government policies on urban forest protection and expansion. However, there were divergent views about how effective solutions based on increasing operational capacities, such as increasing budgets and personnel, could address these challenges. For some managers, it was more effective to improve critical governance challenges, such as inter-departmental and inter-municipal coordination, community engagement, and addressing the culture of risk aversion in local governments. Urban forest regional strategies aimed at coordinating management and governance issues across cities should build on existing consensus on development and environmental threats and address critical management and governance issues not solely related to local government operational capacity."
"Hearing loss prevalence and years lived with disability, 1990-2019: Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 Hearing Aids; Very Elderly; Auditory Training Background: Hearing loss affects access to spoken language, which can affect cognition and development, and can negatively affect social wellbeing. We present updated estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study on the prevalence of hearing loss in 2019, as well as the condition's associated disability. Methods: We did systematic reviews of population-representative surveys on hearing loss prevalence from 1990 to 2019. We fitted nested meta-regression models for severity-specific prevalence, accounting for hearing aid coverage, cause, and the presence of tinnitus. We also forecasted the prevalence of hearing loss until 2050. Findings: An estimated 1Â·57 billion (95% uncertainty interval 1Â·51â€“1Â·64) people globally had hearing loss in 2019, accounting for one in five people (20Â·3% [19Â·5â€“21Â·1]). Of these, 403Â·3 million (357Â·3â€“449Â·5) people had hearing loss that was moderate or higher in severity after adjusting for hearing aid use, and 430Â·4 million (381Â·7â€“479Â·6) without adjustment. The largest number of people with moderate-to-complete hearing loss resided in the Western Pacific region (127Â·1 million people [112Â·3â€“142Â·6]). Of all people with a hearing impairment, 62Â·1% (60Â·2â€“63Â·9) were older than 50 years. The Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index explained 65Â·8% of the variation in national age-standardised rates of years lived with disability, because countries with a low HAQ Index had higher rates of years lived with disability. By 2050, a projected 2Â·45 billion (2Â·35â€“2Â·56) people will have hearing loss, a 56Â·1% (47Â·3â€“65Â·2) increase from 2019, despite stable age-standardised prevalence. Interpretation: As populations age, the number of people with hearing loss will increase. Interventions such as childhood screening, hearing aids, effective management of otitis media and meningitis, and cochlear implants have the potential to ameliorate this burden. Because the burden of moderate-to-complete hearing loss is concentrated in countries with low health-care quality and access, stronger health-care provision mechanisms are needed to reduce the burden of unaddressed hearing loss in these settings.

"Finding Common Ground: Developing a Shared Understanding of Tropical Peatswamp Forest Restoration and Fires Across Culture, Language, and Discipline Community Forestry; Forest Governance; Environmental Protection Indigenous and traditional peoples, practitioners and researchers navigate complex social ecological landscapes. The importance of dialogue across cultures, languages, disciplines, and forms of knowledge is increasingly recognised as needed in landscape restoration and environmental governance at multiple scales. A process called adaptive doing was used in two workshops in South Kalimantan Province, followed by remote collaboration among team members in Indonesia and Australia. Examining the breadth of differences in culture, language and knowledge, and recognising assumptions and disciplinary training, enabled each participant to develop a shared understanding of tropical peatswamp forest restoration and fires. The shared understanding extended beyond each participant's original conception and provided a collective vision that brought together the different knowledges, cultural and disciplinary backgrounds, while acting as a point of orientation for the work and purpose within a research project. The experience gained through adaptive doing has led to important collaborative changes in the project and can support future interdisciplinary teams to achieve collaborative practice change and a shared understanding of context."
"Spatial differentiation of non-grain production on cultivated land and its driving factors in coastal China Sleuths; Cellular Automaton Model; Urbanization The rapid development of urbanization and industrialization in coastal China in the past 20 years has exerted a huge squeezing effect on agricultural land use. The phenomenon of non-grain production on cultivated land (NGP) is very common, seriously threatening the protection of high-quality arable land and national food security. In order to find out the overall situation regarding NGP on cultivated land in coastal China, this study revealed the spatial differentiation of NGP and its main driving factors by spatial autocorrelation analysis, multiple linear regression models and geographically weighted regression analysis (GWR). The results show that: (1) in 2018, the non-grain cultivated land area of 11 provinces along the coast of China was about 15.82 Ã— 106 hm2, accounting for 33.65% of the total cultivated land area. (2) The NGP rate in 11 provinces gradually decreased from south to north, but the NGP area showed two peak centers in Guangxi province and Shandong province, then decreased gradually outwards. (3) The low economic benefit of the planting industry (per capita GDP and urban-to-rural disposable income ratio) was the most important driving force, leading to the spatial differentiation of NGP, while the number of rural laborers and land transfer areas also acted as the main driving factors for the spatial differentiation of NGP. However, the influence of each driving factor has obvious spatial heterogeneity. The non-grained area and the non-grain production rate at the municipal level were completely different from those at the provincial level, and the spatial heterogeneity was more prominent. In the future, the local government should control the disorganized spread of NGP, scientifically set the bottom line of NGP, reduce the external pressure of NGP, regulate multi-party land transfer behavior, and strengthen land-use responsibilities. This study can provide a scientific foundation for adjusting land-use planning and cultivated land protection policies in China and other developing countries."
"Video with Impact: Access to the World's Magnetic-Resonance Experts for the Scientific-Education Community Animal Structures; Cadaver; Body Painting Magnetic resonance is a powerful technology that has had a major impact across the physical, life, and medical sciences, from chemistry to medical imaging, with ever-expanding applications in new areas as diverse as mining and food science. It is, however, also a difficult subject to teach, as the theory is complex and requires some familiarity with advanced mathematical concepts to fully comprehend. The first encounters of many students with magnetic resonance are often obscured by explanations that make the subject difficult to understand, lack sufficient detail on the underlying principles, and/or are devoid of real-world examples. This initial, frustrating exposure to the subject can result in disengagement and hinder future attempts to grasp key subject matter. Skilled educators with subject expertise are able to present complex material in an engaging and relevant way, but such people are not present in every institution. A solution to this problem is to use online recordings of globally recognized, engaging lecturers. Here, we report a new resource in the form of four high-quality, online lecture series produced by the Australian and New Zealand Society for Magnetic Resonance (ANZMAG), which are presented by some of the world's best teachers and practitioners of magnetic resonance. The target audience includes postgraduates, final-year undergraduates, university teachers, and researchers. The videos are free to access and are designed to teach and reinforce important concepts in magnetic resonance. To date, the four series, each covering a major topic in magnetic resonance and together totaling over 30 h of lectures, have been viewed over 200,000 times in 168 countries."
"Profiling the glycome of Cardicola forsteri, a blood fluke parasitic to bluefin tuna Opecoelidae; Digenea (Trematoda); Animals Infections by blood flukes (Cardicola spp.) are considered the most significant health issue for ranched bluefin tuna, a major aquaculture industry in Japan and Australia. The hostâ€“parasite interfaces of trematodes, namely their teguments, are particularly rich in carbohydrates, which function both in evasion and modulation of the host immune system, while some are primary antigenic targets. In this study, histochemistry and mass spectrometry techniques were used to profile the glycans of Cardicola forsteri. Fluorescent lectin staining of adult flukes indicates the presence of oligomannose (Concanavalin A-reactive) and fucosylated (Pisum sativum agglutinin-reactive) N-glycans. Additionally, reactivity of succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (s-WGA) was localised to several internal organs of the digestive and monoecious reproductive systems. Glycan structures were further investigated with tandem mass spectrometry, which revealed structures indicated by lectin reactivity. While O-glycans from these adult specimens were not detectable by mass spectrometry, several oligomannose, paucimannosidic, and complex-type N-glycans were identified, including some carrying hexuronic acid and many carrying core xylose. This is, to our knowledge, the first glycomic characterisation of a marine platyhelminth, with broader implications for research into other trematodes."
"Effects of land use and land cover change on ecosystem services in the Koshi River Basin, Eastern Nepal Cultural Ecosystem Services; China; Natural Capital The provision of ecosystem services is directly related to the type of land use and land cover and management practices in a given area. Changes in land use and land cover can alter the supply of ecosystem services and affect the well-being of both humanity and nature. This study analyses the spatiotemporal variations of land use and land cover and quantifies the change in three important ecosystem services (food production, carbon storage, and habitat quality) in the Koshi River Basin, Nepal during 1996â€“2016 by using freely available data and tools such as, Landsat satellite images and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model. During the observed time period, there was an overall gain in urban areas (190 sq.km), forests (773 sq.km) and grassland (431 sq.km); loss of cultivated land (220 sq.km) and shrub lands (847 sq.km), mostly occurring in the lowlands (â‰¤1000 m). As a result of the land cover changes, while food production and carbon storage showed a declining trend, overall habitat quality in the basin increased. There is a need to design novel and effective landscape approaches that address local realities and that will aid the maintenance of ecosystem services. We recommend landscape level planning to improve urban and agricultural sectors and focus on halting the loss of ecosystem services."
"Data in intelligent approach for estimation of disc cutter life using hybrid metaheuristic algorithm China; Dewatering; Confined Aquifer This data in brief presents the monitoring data measured during shield tunnelling of Guangzhouâ€“Shenzhen intercity railway project. The monitoring data includes shield operational parameters, geological conditions, and geometry at the site. The presented data were arbitrarily split into two subsets including the training and testing datasets. The field observations are compared to the forecasting values of the disc cutter life assessed using a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm proposed for â€œPrediction of disc cutter life during shield tunnelling with artificial intelligent via incorporation of genetic algorithm into GMDH-type neural networkâ€ [1]. The presented data can provide a guidance for cutter exchange in shield tunnelling."
"Group Based Unsupervised Feature Selection Manifold Learning; Clustering Algorithm; Dimensionality Reduction Unsupervised feature selection is an important task in machine learning applications, yet challenging due to the unavailability of class labels. Although a few unsupervised methods take advantage of external sources of correlations within feature groups in feature selection, they are limited to genomic data, and suffer poor accuracy because they ignore input data or encourage features from the same group. We propose a framework which facilitates unsupervised filter feature selection methods to exploit input data and feature group information simultaneously, encouraging features from different groups. We use this framework to incorporate feature group information into Laplace Score algorithm. Our method achieves high accuracy compared to other popular unsupervised feature selection methods (~30% maximum improvement of Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)) with low computational costs (~50 times lower than embedded methods on average). It has many real world applications, particularly the ones that use image, text and genomic data, whose features demonstrate strong group structures."
"Perpetration of Image-Based Sexual Abuse: Extent, Nature and Correlates in a Multi-Country Sample Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica Image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) is a form of technology-facilitated abuse in which intimate (nude or sexual) images of a person are taken, distributed, or threats are made to distribute the images, without a personâ€™s consent. It is an increasingly criminalized form of sexual abuse, and yet little is known about the perpetrators of these harms, including the extent, relational nature and correlates of perpetration. This article reports on the first multi-country survey study to comprehensively investigate IBSA perpetration. An online panel survey of the general community (aged 16â€“64 years) in the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, and New Zealand (NZ) (n = 6109) found that self-reported IBSA perpetration was relatively common, with one in six (17.5%, n = 1070) respondents engaging in at least one form of IBSA. Logistic regression analyses identified nine characteristics that significantly increased the odds of having engaged in IBSA perpetration during their lifetime, namely: residing in the NZ as opposed to the UK or Australia, being male, having disability/assistance needs, holding attitudes that minimize the harms and excuse the perpetrators of IBSA, engaging in online dating behaviors, engaging in sexual self-image behaviors, and experiencing IBSA victimization (images taken, images distributed, and images threatened). Policy and prevention implications of the findings, as well as directions for future research are discussed."
"On being posthuman in human spaces: critical posthumanist social work with interspecies families Animal Assisted Therapy; Service Dogs; Animals Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes a critical posthumanist orientation to social work as an approach to address the impediments to care experienced by interspecies families. Secondly, it challenges the anthropocentric assumptions that underpin this exclusion of nonhuman family members in human services disciplines such as social work. Design/methodology/approach: This article presents primary data from a qualitative study into social work and other human services practice in the family violence and homelessness sectors in the state of Victoria, Australia. Findings: Social workers undertook companion animal-inclusive practice to counter vulnerability to interspecies families caused by gender- and species-based violence, and by homelessness. Gender- and species-based violence was exacerbated by a lack of refuge options, and contributed to women considering their companion animals to be their children. The vulnerability that homelessness brought upon interspecies families was amplified by stigma within and external to social work and related professions, and the impediment that experiences of homelessness had on being able to provide care for their nonhuman family members. These factors shaped practice with interspecies families. Scope for future practice was also identified. Research limitations/implications: The research findings can be used to inform policy change that includes consideration of nonhuman family members, as well as critical posthuman program design in social work education. Originality/value: Companion animal-inclusive practice with interspecies families in social work is an under researched area, and there is little empirical data available on the nature of this work in Australia. This paper addresses this gap by centring social workers' own accounts of practice. This paper has scope to contribute to education in social work and other welfare fields, with the potential to empower students to challenge assumptions about social work being solely focused on human-centred concerns."
"Scaled-up ‘safety-net’ schooling and the ‘wicked problem’ of educational exclusion in South Australia: problem or solution? Alternative Education; Young; Disengagement In this article, we investigate a major, long-running policy intervention to combat educational exclusion in South Australia (SA): the Interagency Community Action Networks (ICAN)-Flexible Learning Options (FLO) policy and program agenda (ICAN-FLO). SA is unique for having the only bureaucratically systematised â€˜social inclusionâ€™ schooling approach to the problem of early school leaving in Australia. We frame ICAN-FLO using the concept of wicked problems in policy and specify how some problematic features of ICAN-FLO since its inception in 2007 are predicted by this concept. Problems with ICAN-FLO include a lack of public accountability; shortcomings in transparency about attainment of students enrolled in ICAN-FLO; and the consequent danger that public confidence in ICAN-FLO will be undermined. Constructive suggestions to address these weaknesses are offered, including, more conceptual policy work in partnership with collective and independent stakeholder inquiry and research. We conclude that one ever-present danger with bureaucratically scaled-up social inclusion initiatives like ICAN-FLO is that such initiatives become a parallel â€˜safety-netâ€™ education system for the disadvantaged and thereby corrode the principle of an inclusive mainstream education system meeting the needs of all children and young people in SA or elsewhere."
"An Eco-systems Approach to Climate Impacts on Farmer Wellbeing in Konya Closed Basin Agriculture; Indo-Gangetic Plain; Tillage The aim of this study was to examine the impacts of climate change on the wellbeing of farmers in Konya, Turkey. An ecosystems approach was adopted to take a holistic view of the range of inter-related ecological factors. A focus was on psychological and social impacts with a comparison of impacts on farmers engaged in traditional agriculture and those who had adopted conservation agriculture farming practices. Individual interviews and focus groups were conducted with farmers and agricultural workers to gain an increased understanding of the impact of climate change on their wellbeing. The study found that all farmers were under considerable psychological stress and that the introduction of new farming practices such as conservation agriculture led to increased stress in the early stages of adoption. Implications for the psychological and social support of farmers, particularly in the early stages of adoption of new farming practices are highlighted."
"Prediction of the resilient modulus of compacted subgrade soils using ensemble machine learning methods Unbound; Pavements; Subgrade The accurate estimation of resilient modulus (MR) of compacted subgrade soil is imperative for the safe and sustainable design of flexible pavement systems. The aim of this study is to explore the potential of ensemble machine learning techniques for predicting the MR of pavement subgrade soil. For this, 2813 data points from twelve compacted subgrade soils were collected which consists of the following inputs parameters: dry unit weight, weighted plasticity index, deviator stress, confining stress, number of freezeâ€“thaw cycles, and moisture content. Four commonly used machine learning (ML) methods, namely, gradient boosting regression (GBR), decision tree regression (DTR), K nearest neighbour regression (KNR), and random forest regression (RFR) were developed and implemented for forecasting the MR value. Thereafter, several ensemble ML techniques including voting ensemble (VO-ENSM), voting ensemble with RF as a meta-model (VO-ENSM (RF)), stacking ensemble (ST-ENSM) and bagging ensemble (BG-ENSM) were utilised to amalgamate the outputs from the developed standalone ML models. Additionally, a multiple linear regression model was also developed as a baseline. The predictive veracity, reliability and trustworthiness of the developed ensemble models were corroborated using rigorous statistical testing, ranking technique, and uncertainty analysis. The results as obtained have shown that the BG-ENSM outperformed its counterparts in predicting the MR of subgrade soil. Hence, it can be a part of portfolio of predicting tools utilised by the practitioners in evaluating the strength of the pavement subgrade soil. Finally, the sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the strength of input variables on the MR."
"Assessing multi-climate-hazard threat in the coastal region of Bangladesh by combining influential environmental and anthropogenic factors Bangladesh; Cyclonic Storms; Disaster This study developed a geo-spatial framework for assessing multi-hazard threat on the Bangladesh coast, integrating environmental hazards (EH), geo-environmental attributes (GA), and anthropogenic modifications (AM) based on their potential contribution to overall threat. For this purpose, a fuzzy logic based analytical technique was integrated with geospatial mapping. Thematic layers were prepared for twenty-three theoretically important factors representing the three components of threat. The spatial variations of threat and its components were delineated through spatial overlaying of the respective layers in a GIS environment. The final threat map revealed 32% (5338 km2) and 4% (646 km2) of the area of the western deltaic coast, which encompassed >50â€“60% of the areas of Khulna, Bagerhat, and Satkhira districts, was under high and very high threat, respectively, owing primarily to frequent cyclones, salinity ingression, and subsidence, and secondarily to the low elevation of the coast, high astronomical tide, shallow bathymetry, excessive groundwater extraction, and polder construction. High and very high threat zones within the central estuarine coast corresponded to 27% (4518 km2) and 16% (2618 km2) of the area, including most of Bhola, Barguna, and Patuakhali districts, which was attributable to the effects of coastal erosion, sea-level rise, flooding and the ancillary effects of strong wave action, high river discharge, deforestation, and land transformation. Around 14% (948 km2) and 3% (164 km2) of the eastern cliff coast, comprising the southwestern part of the Coxsbazar district, was found to be under high and very high threat, respectively, due to the direct effects of sea-level rise, storm surge, erosion, and indirect effects of closeness to the shoreline, alluvial composition of the beach, tourism, and pollution from industries. The outcomes of this study could guide the coastal managers of Bangladesh in prioritizing actions aimed at disaster risk reduction and sustainable development of this region."
"New public management and the rise of public sector performance audit: Evidence from the Australian case Public Sector; Auditors; Audit Office Purpose: In the context of global new public management reform trends and the associated phenomenon of performance auditing (PA), the purpose of this paper is to explore the rise of performance audit in Australia and examines its focus across audit jurisdictions and the role key stakeholders play in driving its practice. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a multi-jurisdictional analysis of PA in Australia to explore its scale and focus, drawing on the theoretical tools of Goffman. Documentary analysis and interview methods are employed. Findings: Performance audit growth has continued but not always consistently over time and across audit jurisdictions. Despite auditor discourse concerning backstage performance audit intentions being strongly focussed on evaluating programme outcomes, published front stage reports retain a strong control focus. While this appears to reflect Auditors-General (AGs) reluctance to critique government policy, nonetheless there are signs of direct and indirectly recursive relationships emerging between AGs and parliamentarians, the media and the public. Research limitations/implications: PA merits renewed researcher attention as it is now an established process but with ongoing variability in focus and stakeholder influence. Social implications: As an audit technology now well-embedded in the public sector accountability setting, it offers potential insights into matters of local, state and national importance for parliament and the public, but exhibits variable underlying drivers, agendas and styles of presentation that have the capacity to enhance or detract from the public interest. Originality/value: Performance audit emerges as a complex practice deployed as a mask by auditors in managing their relationship with key stakeholders."
"Tunable Optimal Dual Band Metamaterial Absorber for High Sensitivity THz Refractive Index Sensing Metamaterials; Broadband; Frequency Selective Surfaces We present a simple dual band absorber design and investigate it in the terahertz (THz) region. The proposed absorber works in dual operating bands at 5.1 THz and 11.7 THz. By adjusting the graphene chemical potential, the proposed absorber has the controllability of the resonance frequency to have perfect absorption at various frequencies. The graphene surface plasmon resonance results in sharp and narrow resonance absorption peaks. For incident angles up to 8Â°, the structure possesses near-unity absorption. The proposed sensor absorberâ€™s functionality is evaluated using sensing medium with various refractive indices. The proposed sensor is simulated for glucose detection and a maximum sensitivity of 4.72 THz/RIU is observed. It has a maximum figure of merit (FOM) and Quality factor (Q) value of 14 and 32.49, respectively. The proposed optimal absorber can be used to identify malaria virus and cancer cells in blood. Hence, the proposed plasmonic sensor is a serious contender for biomedical uses in the diagnosis of bacterial infections, cancer, malaria, and other diseases."
"Strategic approaches to restoring ecosystems can triple conservation gains and halve costs Forest Restoration; Tropical Dry Forests; Environmental Restoration And Remediation International commitments for ecosystem restoration add up to one-quarter of the worldâ€™s arable land. Fulfilling them would ease global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity decline but could displace food production and impose financial costs on farmers. Here, we present a restoration prioritization approach capable of revealing these synergies and trade-offs, incorporating ecological and economic efficiencies of scale and modelling specific policy options. Using an actual large-scale restoration target of the Atlantic Forest hotspot, we show that our approach can deliver an eightfold increase in cost-effectiveness for biodiversity conservation compared with a baseline of non-systematic restoration. A compromise solution avoids 26% of the biomeâ€™s current extinction debt of 2,864 plant and animal species (an increase of 257% compared with the baseline). Moreover, this solution sequesters 1 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent (a 105% increase) while reducing costs by US$28 billion (a 57% decrease). Seizing similar opportunities elsewhere would offer substantial contributions to some of the greatest challenges for humankind."
"Volatility impacts on the European banking sector: GFC and COVID-19 Implied Volatility; Stochastic Volatility Model; Option Pricing This paper analyses the volatility transmission between European Global Systematically Important Banks (GSIBs) and implied stock market volatility. A Dynamic Conditional Correlation Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model is applied to determine the dynamic correlation between returns of Europeâ€™s GSIBs and the worldâ€™s most prominent measure of market â€œfearâ€, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). The results identify a higher negative co-relationship between the VIX and GSIB returns during the COVID-19 period compared with the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), with one-day lagged changes in the VIX negatively Granger-causing bank returns. The asymmetric impact of changes in implied volatility is examined by quantile regressions, with the findings showing that in the lower quartileâ€“where extreme negative bank returns are presentâ€“jumps in the VIX are highly significant. This effect is more pronounced during COVID-19 than during the GFC. Additional robustness analysis shows that these findings are consistent during the periods of the Swine Flu and Zika virus epidemics."
"“Pornography Encouraged Me to Belittle Women”: A Thematic Analysis of Men's Reflections on Violence Against Women and Ceasing Pornography Use Erotica; Porn; Sexual Behavior Within a context of increasingly ubiquitous pornography consumption among men, little is known about men who reject pornography, their motivations to stop consuming it, and their concerns about the treatment of women. In this article, we explore the stated motivations of 124 men who have decided to stop consuming pornography, in order to understand what roleâ€”if anyâ€”concerns about violence against women and gender equality played in their decision. Specifically, we focus on the implications of these findings for future research on the role of men in preventing or addressing harmful attitudes about women through their everyday practices."
"Energy poverty and health: Panel data evidence from Australia Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Australia's diverse climate makes it vulnerable to cold winters and extremely warm summers, characterised by severe bushfires and heat waves. Thus, unlike most European countries, energy poverty in Australia is linked with difficulty both maintaining adequate warmth during winter and ensuring adequate cooling during summer. Energy poverty in Australia is, therefore, associated with cold-and-heat-related health issues. We draw on 13 waves of representative panel data for the Australian adult population to examine the relationship between energy poverty and self-assessed health. We use both objective and subjective indicators of energy poverty. We instrument for energy poverty using energy prices. When we instrument for energy poverty, we find that a standard deviation increase in energy poverty is associated with a decline in general health between 0.099 and 0.296 standard deviations. The finding that energy poverty lowers health is robust to different ways of measuring health and alternative methods to addressing endogeneity of energy poverty, including using internal instruments, dynamic panel methods and propensity score matching."
"HALE wing experiments and computational models to predict nonlinear flutter and dynamic response Slender Wings; Flexible; Flutter Experimental and numerical investigations into the linear and nonlinear aeroelastic behaviour of very flexible High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) wings are conducted to assess the effect of geometrical nonlinearities on wings displaying moderate-to-large displacement. The study shows that the dynamic behaviour of wings under large deflection, and specifically the edgewise and torsion natural frequencies and modal characteristics, are largely affected by the presence of geometrical nonlinearities. A modular wing structure has been manufactured by rapid prototyping and it has been tested to characterise its dynamic and aeroelastic behaviour. At first, several simple isotropic cantilever beams with selected crosssections are numerically investigated to extract their modal characteristics. Experiments are subsequently conducted to validate the geometrically nonlinear dynamics behaviour due to high tip displacement and to understand the influence of the beam cross-section geometry. The structural dynamics and aeroelastic analysis of a very flexible modular selected wing is then investigated. Clean-wing wind-tunnel tests are carried out to assess flutter and dynamic response. The wind-tunnel model display interesting aeroelastic features including the substantial influence of the wing large deformation on its natural frequencies and modal characteristics."
"A review of cultural background and thermal perceptions in urban environments Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Microclimate Thermal comfort is among the chief indicators of the sustainability of outdoor spaces. However, the complex nature of comfort represents the interaction of several determinants that leads to a perception of the thermal environment. Recently, researchers have paid particular attention to non-physical factors to understand the mechanisms involved in thermal perceptions in urban environments. The extant literature has contended that culture and cultural background are determinants to individualsâ€™ thermal perceptions. Therefore, this study aimed to review how the link between outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) and cultural background is investigated. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first review study on the subject. The study used a systematic literature review approach based on secondary data available in relevant and contemporary literature. The findings first showed the scarcity of research on cultural background and OTC; however, all studies identified corroborated the significant impact of cultural background on thermal perceptions. Notably, the cultural background was found to be the source of variation in thermal perceptions, tolerance to, and preference for certain thermal conditions, thermal comfort requirements and expectations, choice of clothing, and environmental attitudes. The findings provide a sound basis for future researchers to address the research gaps identified. The study also raises policy makersâ€™ and designersâ€™ awareness of urban environment usersâ€™ genuine needs and requirements."
"The leadership role of teachers and environment club coordinators in promoting ecocentrism in secondary schools: Teachers as exemplars of environmental education Deep Ecology; Sustainability; Anthropocentric This study of Naessian ecocentrism and anthropocentrism in three environment club coordinators/science teachers, their colleagues and some parents at three secondary schools uses deep ecology and relational fields as primary frameworks for open-ended interviews. The findings reveal new insights into the affective, cognitive and behavioural characteristics of coordinators who enhance environmental education in their schools. The work presents preliminary data on leadership among sustainability coordinators who run environment clubs. It fills a gap in the literature by showing that in addition to environmental educators requiring knowledge and attitudes regarding sustainability practices, affective qualities like connectedness and love for the environment may be important to their success as sustainability exemplars. Teachers emerge as sustainability exemplars in a relational field to implement sustainability across the secondary curriculum, galvanise students, teachers and parents to connect to the Earth, and help students, teachers and parents move away from anthropocentrism. Findings suggest that if schools commit resources and time to the coordinator's role, students experience significant benefits by becoming closer to the Earth and more empowered to act for the environment in ways consistent with deep ecology."
"Smart infrastructure: Innovative energy technology, climate mitigation, and consumer protection in Australia and Germany Energy Transition; Innovation System; Sustainability â€˜Smart infrastructureâ€™, such as smart meters, are innovative, information-based energy technologies designed to promote systemic energy efficiency, cost savings, and to transition energy markets toward sustainable outcomes, including reducing climate change impacts. Smart meters promise innovation in electricity markets-as an enabler of demand-side services and a more distributed energy system. The chapter examines three case studies of legal reform for smart meter introduction in Australia and Germany. It concludes that the realization of the innovation promise of smart infrastructure requires the legal system to address consumer-oriented social and economic changes. While legal responses are growing in sophistication, significant questions around consumer protection remain, although Germany emphasizes consumer privacy more than Australian case studies. Finally, Germany most closely links innovation to climate change and electricity system transitions, whereas, increasingly, Australian policies emphasize the consumer benefits and innovation in the business models for electricity distribution."
"Accelerated carbonation treatment of recycled concrete aggregates using flue gas: A comparative study towards performance improvement Carbonation; Carbon Dioxide; Curing (Nonfood Products) CO2 source is one of the limiting factors for popularizing the accelerated carbonation technology in recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) improvement. In this paper, the feasibility of using flue gas (CO2 content of 20 %) from cement plant as alternative CO2 source to improve RCAs was systematically studied and evaluated. Results showed that the carbonation extent and physical properties of the RCAs treated by flue gas were obviously improved and were comparable to those treated by commercial mixed gas with CO2 content between 20 % and 100 %. Based on the results of thermal gravimetric (TG), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, calcium hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrates in RCAs were significantly transformed into calcium carbonate at the optimal gas flow rate (5 L/min) after 168 h of treatment. The workability, compressive strength and flexural strength of concrete incorporating carbonated RCAs treated by flue gas were comparable with those treated by mixed CO2 gas, but were much better than those of concrete containing non-carbonated RCAs at all the replacement rate. Finally, the environmental impact and economic feasibility using flue gas to improve RCAs were evaluated based on a combined waste recycling system. All indicated that flue gas could be effectively utilized as CO2 source to improve RCAs."
"Long-term impact of natural disasters on vietnamese income per capita: The case of typhoon durian Synthetic Control Method; Disasters; Cyclonic Storms This study estimates the effect of natural disasters on Vietnamese income per capita in both short and long-term. The analysis also evaluates the effects by sources of income including income from salary; income from agriculture, fishery, forest; and income from industry, construction, trade, and services. Typhoon Durian happened in December 2006 in southern provinces of Vietnam is chosen for the comparative case study. The analysis applies the Synthetic control method (SCM) to construct a counterfactual with respect to two different control groups and conducts a permutation test for the estimated values. The results show that typhoon Durian decreased aggregate income per capita of the affected region and the effect was long lasting. The reduction of monthly income per capita was estimated to be 56,925 VND which accounts for 7.9% of the total income. The most affected source of income is from agriculture, forestry, and fishery."
Packaging Strategies That Save Food: A Research Agenda for 2030 Food Loss; Waste Prevention; Community Participation Thoroughly considering and optimizing packaging systems can avoid food loss and waste. We suggest a number of issues that must be explored and review the associated challenges. Five main issues were recognized through the extensive experience of the authors and engagement of multiple stakeholders. The issues promoted are classified as follows: (1) identify and obtain specific data of packaging functions that influence food waste; (2) understand the total environmental burden of product/package by considering the trade-off between product protection and preservation and environmental footprint; (3) develop understanding of how these functions should be treated in environmental footprint evaluations; (4) improve packaging design processes to also consider reducing food waste; and (5) analyze stakeholder incentives to reduce food loss and waste. Packaging measures that save food will be important to fulfill the United Nations Sustainable Development goal to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and to reduce food losses along production and supply chains.
"Are fire services ‘extremely gendered’ organizations? Examining the Country Fire Authority (CFA) in Australia Wildfires; Wildland-Urban Interface; Disaster Emergency management organizations often have military-based histories and continue to maintain militaristic styles of operation. Similar to the military, these organizations tend to be male dominated and culturally masculinized. The militarization and masculinization of rural fire services in Australia are generally unrecognized but highly important elements defining these organizations, and the example of the Country Fire Authority (CFA) is considered here. Using a cultural artefacts approach, historical and contemporary elements of the CFA's structure and practice are analysed using the concept of an â€˜extremely genderedâ€™ organization, with a focus on how the CFA is structurally and culturally gendered. We argue there is value in expanding the notion of â€˜extremely genderedâ€™ institutions beyond the military, to include other militarized organizations. Doing so not only helps to better understand and address resistance to change and gender equality measures, it also draws attention to the important role that such organizations play in the greater patriarchal order."
"The Distribution of People and Employment in Metropolitan Commutersheds: The Impact on Rural Housing Markets Counterurbanisation; Rural Population; Rurality The concentration of population in the major metropolitan cities has again become prominent in public debate in Australia. Politicians and commentators have called for an increase in the population of rural areas by improving commuter access to metropolitan employment through infrastructure investments that facilitate commuting from regional places of residence to metropolitan places of work, referred to as metro-bound commuters. This article investigates the impact of commuter-based population growth on rural communities, and particularly housing markets. Increasing rural housing markets indicate a process of gentrification, calling into question policies that promote population redistribution not underpinned by rural employment growth."
"Policing repeat and high-risk family violence: police and service-sector perceptions of a coordinated model Domestic Violence; Intimate Partner Violence; Police Family violence forms a significant part of police-work, with many police agencies adopting evolving responses to family violence over time. This article presents the qualitative findings of a mixed-method evaluation of â€˜Alexisâ€™, a coordinated police-social-services approach to family violence piloted in the state of Victoria, Australia. In-depth interviews were conducted with 14 stakeholders (7 police members and 7 community service providers) to examine perceptions of how the model was working and how it differed from other policing approaches to family violence. Five key themes were extracted from the data via thematic analysis: (i) collaboration between police, an embedded family violence worker and other agencies; (ii) increased police accountability; (iii) adoption of a proactive major crime approach; (iv) emphasis on professional development; and (v) the allocation of dedicated time and resources. Implications for future policy development are discussed, with the findings highlighting promising practices for policing high-risk and recidivist family violence."
"Urban children and adolescents’ perspectives on the importance of nature Greenspace; Green Infrastructure; National Parks People who regard nature as important and personally meaningful are often compelled to conserve it. This compulsion is increasingly vital in a world where global climate and biodiversity crises are worsening, with younger generations set to bear most of the resulting ecological burden. By understanding why children and adolescents value nature, we can gain insights into how they might act for its benefit. In this study, we asked over 1000 Australian students (aged 8â€“14) to explain why â€˜natureâ€™ wasâ€”or was notâ€”important to them. Qualitative responses were gathered via a survey methodology using an online questionnaire, with thematic analysis used to identify key findings. Results show that respondents valued nature for its ability to keep humans alive and resourced, also appreciating nature as beautiful and relaxing. Respondents frequently commented on how nature made them feel: happiness, love, freedom, and calm featured prominently. A small number of students reported ambivalence about nature, or even feelings of fear. These results demonstrate substantial depth to studentsâ€™ understandings of nature and the ways they choose to engage with their surroundings. Encompassing a diversity of perspectives on nature allows us to better engage with youth on environmental matters."
"A machine learning platform for the discovery of materials Generalized Gradient Approximation; First-principles Calculation; Density Functional Theory For photovoltaic materials, properties such as band gap Eg are critical indicators of the materialâ€™s suitability to perform a desired function. Calculating Eg is often performed using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods, although more accurate calculation are performed using methods such as the GW approximation. DFT software often used to compute electronic properties includes applications such as VASP, CRYSTAL, CASTEP or Quantum Espresso. Depending on the unit cell size and symmetry of the material, these calculations can be computationally expensive. In this study, we present a new machine learning platform for the accurate prediction of properties such as Eg of a wide range of materials."
"A comparative study of biological activated carbon based treatments on two different types of municipal reverse osmosis concentrates Ozonation; Micropollutant; Effluent A study was conducted to understand the impact of reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) characteristics on the efficacy of biological activated carbon (BAC) based treatments for removing organics and nutrients from two ROC streams (ROCa derived from municipal waste input with high salinity, and ROCb derived from domestic waste plus industrial trade waste with markedly lower salinity). Fluorescence excitation and emission matrix spectra and molecular weight analysis demonstrated that ROCa and ROCb had a significantly different composition of organic compounds due to the petrochemical processing and abattoir waste compounds in ROCb. Although the sequence of coagulation, UV/H2O2 and BAC gave the highest organic removal from the two ROCs (67% DOC for ROCa and 62% for ROCb), UV/H2O2 followed by BAC achieved satisfactory removal (>55%) for both ROC types. Sequential treatment involving coagulation gave better phosphorus removal (>90%) than any single treatment (<65%). Total nitrogen (TN) removal was fairly low (<50%) for all the treatment options and the salinity level had insignificant impact on nitrogen removal. Analysis of bacterial communities suggested that higher phosphorus removal and lower total nitrogen and nitrate removal from ROCb than ROCa was related to the presence of various denitrifying or phosphorus accumulating bacteria in the BAC."
"MODELLING the KEY ENABLERS of ORGANIZATIONAL BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) IMPLEMENTATION: AN INTERPRETIVE STRUCTURAL MODELLING (ISM) APPROACH Information Modeling; Facilities Management; Construction Industry Building Information Modelling (BIM) implementation is a dynamic process and there are a number of influential variables that may change throughout. There is little research on the dynamics of the change environment and the AEC organizations approaches to BIM adoption and implementation. A considerable number of BIM enablers have been identified and/or developed in the extant literature. However, stipulating BIM implementation enablers per se provides only a static view that is not adequate for describing effective management of BIM implementation in Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) organizations. This study is the second part of an ongoing research about BIM implementation enablers. In the first paper ""Building Information Modelling (BIM) adoption and implementation enablers in AEC firms: A systematic literature review"" (Abbasnejad et al., 2020) the organizational BIM enablers have been identified. The aim of this second paper is to (1) further review and validate the key BIM implementation enablers using both the existing literature and expert interviews, and (2) develop a structural model of the key enablers using the ISM technique to understand the mutual interaction of these enablers and identify the driving enablers and the dependent enablers. Twenty-eight enablers for BIM implementation were initially identified from the literature and subsequent discussion with experts from academia and industry has been conducted to select most key BIM implementation enablers. Eleven enablers were finally chosen based on the literature review and expert interviews and the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) technique has been adopted to evaluate the contextual interrelationships among them. MICMAC (Matrix Impacts Cross-reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification) analysis was employed to classify the eleven enablers based on their dependence and driving power. The results indicate that there is no enabler in the autonomous cluster and this therefore signifies that all enablers are required for the implementation of BIM. BIM leadership and top management support have been identified as the enablers with the highest driving power in the initial stages of the BIM adoption and implementation process and for that reason, these enablers demand a greater priority given that there are other dependent enablers that will be impacted."
"Determinants of foreign direct investment inflows: The role of economic policy uncertainty Economic Policy Uncertainty; Macroeconomic Variables; China This article investigates the impacts of the domestic economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and the World Uncertainty (WUI) on net foreign direct investment inflows (FDI) for 21 economies over the period 2003â€“2013. By using the sequential (two-stage) technique of linear panel data models, this study provides two major results. First, the growth rate of domestic EPU adversely affects FDI inflows. Second, when combined with the domestic EPU level, the World Uncertainty (WUI) that includes the economic policy uncertainty measure of 143 countries has a positive impact on the FDI inflows into the host country. The findings suggest that although domestic economic policy uncertainty has an adverse effect on FDI inflows; an increase in the global (world) economic policy uncertainty could increase FDI inflows into the country. We explain this systematic aversion to global uncertainty through the existence of a behavioural bias (anchor and adjustment) illustrating the investorsâ€™ sensitivity to their ability to associate a frame to uncertainty."
"Plant and microbial impacts of an invasive species vary across an environmental gradient Wetlands; Reed; Lipara Invasive plants often successfully occupy large areas encompassing broad environmental gradients in their invaded range, yet how invader dominance and effects on ecological communities vary across the landscape has rarely been explored. Furthermore, while the impacts of invasion on plant communities are well studied, it is not well understood whether responses of above-ground (plant) and below-ground (microbial) communities are coupled. Here we test patterns in Phragmites australis (common reed) invasion in a field survey of eight sites situated across a salinity gradient, ranging from freshwater to saline marsh, in Southeast Louisiana. At each site, we surveyed plant composition and used metabarcoding methods to assess soil fungal and bacterial composition in plots within the dense Phragmites stand, in a transition zone of ~50:50 Phragmites:native plants, and in native-only areas. We hypothesized that Phragmites' abundance and impact on above- and below-ground communities would vary across the salinity gradient and that the responses of above- and below-ground communities to invasion would be coupled. We found weak evidence that invasion varied across the gradient: Phragmites stem densities increased slightly with salinity, and Phragmites increased above-ground litter accumulation more in fresh and saline areas compared to brackish. We found stronger evidence that plant and microbial responses to invasion varied with salinity. Phragmites strongly reduced native plant density across the gradient, with slightly greater reductions in fresh and saline areas. Plant species richness displayed consistent decreases with invasion across the salinity gradient; however, fungal and bacterial richness increased sharply with invasion only in brackish sites. Furthermore, the effect of Phragmites on plant and microbial community composition became stronger as salinity increased. Plants and microbes exhibited coupled responses to invasion in the magnitude of compositional shifts brought on by Phragmites, but Phragmites' effects on richness were not coupled. Synthesis. Overall, the variability in Phragmites impacts across the gradient, particularly soil microbial impacts, suggests that it may be difficult to generalize invader effects from single-site or single-ecosystem studies. However, above- and below-ground communities showed some coupled responses to Phragmites; thus understanding plant community responses to invasion gives insight into impacts occurring below-ground."
"Challenges and Current Status of the Biological Treatment of PFAS-Contaminated Soils Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are Synthetic Organic Compounds (SOCs) which are of current concern as they are linked to a myriad of adverse health effects in mammals. They can be found in drinking water, rivers, groundwater, wastewater, household dust, and soils. In this review, the current challenge and status of bioremediation of PFAs in soils was examined. While several technologies to remove PFAS from soil have been developed, including adsorption, filtration, thermal treatment, chemical oxidation/reduction and soil washing, these methods are expensive, impractical for in situ treatment, use high pressures and temperatures, with most resulting in toxic waste. Biodegradation has the potential to form the basis of a cost-effective, large scale in situ remediation strategy for PFAS removal from soils. Both fungal and bacterial strains have been isolated that are capable of degrading PFAS; however, to date, information regarding the mechanisms of degradation of PFAS is limited. Through the application of new technologies in microbial ecology, such as stable isotope probing, metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics there is the potential to examine and identify the biodegradation of PFAS, a process which will underpin the development of any robust PFAS bioremediation technology."
"The regulation of learning and co-creation of new knowledge in mobile learning Self-Regulated Learning; Metacognition; Self-Control Mobile devices as learning tools enrich mobile computer supported collaborative learning (mCSCL). Engaging in metacognitive interaction promotes students' regulatory learning and this can provide a positive influence to learning outcomes. However, despite insightful empirical studies, there is no research into the actual processes of new knowledge creation in this context. This leads to the question of how mobile learning experiences can support the co-creation of new knowledge. Two classroom action research studies were carried out using a qualitative research approach. The analysis of the mobile messages using conversation analysis indicates that self-regulated learning in mCSCL is non-linear, defying existing theory. The findings also show that learners find ways to self-regulate learning activities in socially stimulated learning environments. Through knowledge sharing, students seek new insights into the learning instead of mere transfer of existing content. The Strategic Cocreation of New Knowledge in mCSCL Model has been developed providing innovative ways to approach mobile learning. The findings also comprise improved descriptive models in cross-boundary learning. This research is significant as emerging elements encourage instructors to rethink and design better mobile learning activities to optimize learning. Three recommendations are made and if implemented, will enable learning facilitators to achieve enhanced learning outcomes, engage learners better and improve learning experiences."
"HIGH SPEED VIDEOMETRIC MONITORING of ROCK BREAKAGE Ball Mills; Comminution; Mill Estimation of rock breakage characteristics plays an important role in optimising various industrial and mining processes used for rock comminution. Although little research has been undertaken into 3D photogrammetric measurement of the progeny kinematics, there is promising potential to improve the efficacy of rock breakage characterisation. In this study, the observation of progeny kinematics was conducted using a high speed, stereo videometric system based on laboratory experiments with a drop weight impact testing system. By manually tracking individual progeny through the captured video sequences, observed progeny coordinates can be used to determine 3D trajectories and velocities, supporting the idea that high speed video can be used for rock breakage characterisation purposes. An analysis of the results showed that the high speed videometric system successfully observed progeny trajectories and showed clear projection of the progeny away from the impact location. Velocities of the progeny could also be determined based on the trajectories and the video frame rate. These results were obtained despite the limitations of the photogrammetric system and experiment processes observed in this study. Accordingly there is sufficient evidence to conclude that high speed videometric systems are capable of observing progeny kinematics from drop weight impact tests. With further optimisation of the systems and processes used, there is potential for improving the efficacy of rock breakage characterisation from measurements with high speed videometric systems."
"Redressing gendered undervaluation in New Zealand aged care: Institutions, activism and coalitions Political Representation; Quotas; Parliament This article explores the apparent conundrum of how, with minimal employment standards and limited equal pay laws, New Zealand managed to significantly redress the gendered undervaluation of low-paid aged care work. To draw out the pathways to these reforms, we focus on the long-term strategic coalitions that underpinned them. We examine, in particular, the activism of a diverse range of policy actors â€“ unions, employers, industrial and human rights bodies and civil society groups, which together have worked to â€˜undoâ€™ the limitations of equal pay and employment regulation. Our findings point to the benefits of strategic collaboration between policy actors in New Zealand and an approach which recognises the intersection of unequal pay with other gendered dimensions of disadvantage in aged care work. Different strategies used over time by diverse actors helped them overcome inadequate industrial and equal pay infrastructure to realise meaningful increases in hourly rates of pay, buttressed by improved working time arrangements and provision for career progression. We conclude by highlighting some lessons for institutional and policy actors in other national settings drawn from the New Zealand collaborative approach to equal pay in care work."
"A new high step-up DC-DC converter for renewable energy applications DC-DC Converter; Inductors; Acceleration (Physics) This paper presents a new non-isolated boost converter with high boost ability and low voltage stress on the main switch. The proposed converter uses a hybrid switched-inductor (SL)/switched-capacitor (SC) technique to couple with an active switched network. The proposed converter is very suitable for many industrial applications such as photovoltaic (PV) and fuel-cell. A multicell hybrid SL/SC structure of the proposed converter is also derived in order to get a higher boost ratio. The operation principle, parameter design, and comparison with other converters are given. A laboratory prototype with the closed-loop control is designed for test, and both simulation and experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed converter."
"Political hazards and entry modes of Chinese investments in Africa International Joint Ventures; Multinational Corporations; Foreign Subsidiaries Africa has achieved the fastest growth rate of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) recently. Yet heightened political hazards present substantial challenges to foreign firms in Africa. This study examines the entry strategies that firms may take to mitigate such hazards by exploring the relationship between political hazards and entry mode choices in Africa. We further consider how an investing firmâ€™s host country experience and foreign aid provided by its home country government to host countries in Africa can influence this relationship. In a sample of listed Chinese firmsâ€™ investments in Africa from 2000 to 2014, we find that Chinese firms tend to use the joint venture mode when political hazards are high in an African country. This relationship is weakened when they accumulate host country experience and when the Chinese governmentâ€™s foreign aid to an African country increases. Our findings point to firm-level strategies to mitigate political hazards as well as instruments available to home country governments to help their multinational firms operating in host countries characterized by unstable political environments."
"Image-Based Geometrical Characterization of Nodes in Additively Manufactured Lattice Structures Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Additive manufacturing (AM) enables the fabrication of lattice structures with optimal mechanical, fluid, and thermal properties. However, during the AM fabrication process, defects are produced in the strut and node elements, which comprise the lattice structure. This leads to discrepancies between the AM fabricated lattice and its idealized computer-aided design (CAD) model, negatively affecting the ability to predict the mechanical behavior of the fabricated lattice via numerical models. Current research is focused on quantification of geometric uncertainties in the strut elements of the lattice; as-manufactured node geometries remain relatively unexplored on an individual scale, despite their criticality to the mechanical response of the structure. Understanding the geometrical properties of as-manufactured nodes relative to CAD idealizations can be used to improve lattice designs and numerical models. In this research, X-ray microcomputed tomography (Î¼CT) is used to analyze and quantify the as-manufactured nodal geometry, found in face-centered cubic and face-centered cubic with axial struts lattices fabricated via selective laser melting. A custom tool is developed that enables auto-isolation and classification of nodal joints from Î¼CT-derived cross-sectional slices. Geometrical properties are extracted from the isolated nodal cross sections and compared with their idealized CAD model counterpart. Quantification of geometrical defects provides insight into how nodes within an AM lattice structure differ from each other and their idealized design. Overall, this research is an initial step toward developing accurate and efficient numerical models, as well as better node design for AM."
"12-month randomised controlled trial of ginseng extract for moderate COPD Ginseng; Placebos; Male Fertility Background Panax ginseng (ginseng) is a therapeutic herb which might be beneficial in COPD. The study investigated if ginseng, compared with placebo, is effective and safe for people with moderate COPD. Methods This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared 24 weeks of ginseng capsules (100 mg twice daily) with placebo. Participants were followed up for a further 24 weeks. Participants were aged 40 years and over and had airflow limitation in the moderate (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2) COPD range. The coprimary endpoints were the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, the COPD Assessment Test and the Short Form Health Survey. Secondary outcomes included lung function, exacerbation rate and use of relief medication. Findings 168 participants were randomised 1:1 from five centres in Australia and China. Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups. There were no significant differences between ginseng and placebo, with overall results improving in both groups. Ginseng seemed safe for, and well tolerated by, people with COPD. Interpretation There was no significant difference in improvement in health-related quality of life (primary outcome) between the ginseng and placebo groups. Trial registration number ACTRN12610000768099."
"International portfolio strategies and opportunities: The case of the US, Japan and Asia Volatility Spillover; Spillover; Comovement This study examines long- and short-run diversification gains for a portfolio comprising the developed (DJIA, S&P 500, and Nikkei 225) markets and emerging or frontier Asian markets. The study covers two periods: 2000â€“2013 and 2000â€“2018. This allows for a comparison of an investment made in the year 2000 and ended in either 2013 or 2018. Long- and short-term diversification gains are examined using different data frequencies to allow for the possibilities of portfolio rebalancing on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. The study reveals differences in both long- and short-term diversification gains under these scenarios."
"Plastic Waste Upcycling: A Sustainable Solution for Waste Management, Product Development, and Circular Economy Plastic Waste; Pyrolysis; Catalyst Plastic waste pollution, including non-biodegradable landfills, leaching of toxic chemicals into soil and waterways, and emission of toxic gases into the atmosphere, is significantly affecting our environment. Conventional plastic waste recycling approaches generally produce lower value materials compared to the original plastic or recover inefficient heat energy. Lately, upcycling or the valorization approach has emerged as a sustainable solution to transform plastic waste into value-added products. In this review, we present an overview of recent advancements in plastic waste upcycling, such as vitrimerization, nanocomposite fabrication, additive manufacturing, catalytic transformation, and industrial biotechnology, envisaged with technical challenges, future developments, and new circular economy opportunities."
"Social support and self-care outcomes in adults with diabetes: The mediating effects of self-efficacy and diabetes distress. Results of the second diabetes MILES – Australia (MILES-2) study Diabetes Mellitus; Management Education; Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring Aims: Diabetes self-care outcomes are positively impacted by social support. Understanding the mechanisms involved can inform more effective interventions. This study tested potential cross-sectional mediation of social support through self-efficacy and diabetes distress for self-care and clinical outcomes (diet, physical activity, blood glucose monitoring, HbA1c). Method: We analysed a sub-sample of the Australian Diabetes MILES-2 cross-sectional online survey (N = 1727). Measures were: Diabetes Social Support Scale, Confidence in Diabetes Self-care Scale, Problem Areas In Diabetes scale, diet and physical activity subscales of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities, and self-reported HbA1c. Separate mediation path models were tested for each of the four self-care/clinical outcomes in groups with type 1 and type 2 (insulin- and non-insulin-treated) diabetes. Results: Social support was associated with more optimal self-care and self-reported HbA1c outcomes. When diabetes-specific self-efficacy and distress were included as mediators, the direct path from social support became non-significant. Conversely, the indirect effects of social support through diabetes-specific self-efficacy and distress were significant across all diabetes groups and outcomes. Conclusion: Diabetes-specific self-efficacy and distress may be important mechanisms linking social support with diabetes self-care and clinical outcomes. Social support interventions could explore whether improving diabetes self-efficacy and decreasing diabetes distress could help improve self-care."
"Sustainable cold supply chain management under demand uncertainty and carbon tax regulation Inventory Routing; Supply Chain; Vendor Managed Inventory Increasing awareness of sustainability in supply chain management has prompted organizations and individuals to consider environmental impacts when managing supply chains. The issues concerning environmental impacts are significant in cold supply chains due to substantial carbon emissions from storage and distribution of temperature-sensitive product. This paper investigates the impact of carbon emissions arising from storage and transportation in the cold supply chain in the presence of carbon tax regulation, and under uncertain demand. A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed to determine optimal replenishment policies and transportation schedules to minimize both operational and emissions costs. A matheuristic algorithm based on the Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm and a mixed integer programming is developed to solve the problem in realistic sizes. The performance and robustness of the matheuristic algorithm are analyzed using test instances in various sizes. A real-world case study in Queensland, Australia is used to demonstrate the application of the model. The results highlight that higher emissions price does not always contribute to the efficiency of the cold supply chain system. Furthermore, the analyses indicate that using heterogeneous fleet including light duty and medium duty vehicles can lead to further cost saving and emissions reduction."
"Urban forest governance and decision-making: A systematic review and synthesis of the perspectives of municipal managers Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Empirical research on the views of municipal managers can provide insights into urban forest governance and decision-making. However, current research is fragmented across a diversity of case studies using a variety of methods. To address this issue, we undertook a systematic review and synthesis of empirical studies based on the views of municipal managers. We extracted information on the concerns, priorities, factors, and actors that influence municipal manager decision-making using a governance framework to extract ideas on the discourses, actors, rules, and resources that influence their decision-making. Out of >1400 articles found in searches, only 60 were relevant empirical studies, with 32 of them based in the US. Most studies elicited views from managers using pre-determined surveys/questionnaires. This literature is focused heavily on themes of resources, such as budgets and personnel, as important influences in program performance and urban forest success. Themes related to coordination of actors, such as the coordination of departmental units, were also frequently mentioned but were not explicitly associated with program performance or urban forest success. Future research aimed at gaining insights on urban forest governance and decision-making from the perspective of municipal managers will benefit from distinguishing operational capacities (i.e., budgets, personnel) from management processes (i.e., coordination), and focus on how municipal managers understand, facilitate, and find support in management processes. This will reveal how they implement co-governance and collaborative decision-making. Future research could better extend the knowledge base of existing studies by establishing clear governance frameworks and methods based on the views of managers."
"Occurrence of perfluoroalkyl substances in selected Victorian rivers and estuaries: An historical snapshot Fluorocarbon; Fluorochemicals; Perfluorooctane This reconnaissance study was undertaken in 2012 to examine the occurrence of common perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), including perfluoroalkyl sulphonic acids and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids in rivers and estuaries in Port Philip Bay, Victoria, Australia. In total, 19 PFAS were screened in grab samples of water using a combination of solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry measurement techniques. Eighteen of the PFAS screened were observed in samples. The highest level of PFOS observed at a freshwater site was 0.045 Î¼g/L; this concentration is approximately half the draft Australian 95% species protection level for total PFOS. The highest level of PFOA in the study (0.014 Î¼g/L) was some four orders of magnitude lower than the draft Australian trigger value for PFOA (220 Î¼g/L). However, none of the PFAS observed at the freshwater sites had research quotient (RQ) or toxicity unit (TU) values above 1 or -3, respectively. The highest concentration of PFOS observed at an estuarine site was 0.075 Î¼g/L; the highest level of PFOA, 0.09 Î¼g/L). There are no Australian marine water quality trigger values for PFAS, so potential risk was assessed using the European environment quality standards (EQS) adopted in EU Directive 2013/39/EU, RQ and TU methods. In that context, none of the PFAS observed at estuary sites had concentrations higher than the EU standards, or RQ above 1 or Log10TU above -3. Together these assessments suggest none of the PFAS screened would have posed an acute risk to organisms in the fresh or estuary waters studied at the time of sampling on an individual or collective basis. However, the detection of these PFAS in Victorian estuaries highlights that the issue is not just an issue for more densely populated countries in the northern hemisphere, but also potentially of concern in Australia. And, in that context, more sampling campaigns in Port Philip Bay are of paramount importance to assess the potential risk pose by these compounds to aquatic ecosystems."
"Risk management in border inspection Tax Compliance; Taxation; Income As part of their commitments under the WTO's Agreement on Trade Facilitation, many developing countries will adopt risk management, a strategy for selecting import shipments for inspection. In this paper we formalize key enforcement issues related to risk management. We argue that the complexities of international trade oversight mean that inspecting agencies lack certainty about the conditional probability that a given shipment will comply with import regulations. Ambiguity of this sort is likely to be important in developing countries that lack the sophisticated information technology (IT) used in advanced risk management. We show empirically that infrequent shipments have conditionally higher inspection rates, a finding that is consistent with our ambiguity hypothesis. We formalize a role for ambiguity in a theoretical model of border inspection. We calibrate the model and shock the ambiguity parameters to illustrate the consequences of an IT-driven improvement in risk management capabilities for search and compliance."
"‘Two different worlds’: Papua New Guinean women working in development in Port Moresby Papua New Guinea; Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1; Masculinity This article examines the lives of Port Moresby women who work in the development sector of Papua New Guinea. In particular, it demonstrates how development discourse structures the very fabric of working relationships within this sector in Port Moresby. Underpinned by neocolonial geographies in which those in the global north rescue those in the global south, these discourses produce workplaces in which Papua New Guinean women are seen as lacking the moral and technical capacities to run development projects in their own country. The article argues that the privileges held by expatriates and denied to local women, in conjunction with the workplace discrimination to which they are subjected, ironically undermine the development sector's supposed commitment to promoting gender equality in Papua New Guinea."
"Put My Skills to Use? Understanding the Joint Effect of Job Security and Skill Utilization on Job Satisfaction Between Skilled Migrants and Australian Born Workers in Australia Job Insecurity; Personnel; Perceived Employability The topic of skilled migrants has gained importance in the past decade as they are increasingly becoming one of the main drivers for labor supply in developed countries like Australia. Although there is research on skilled migrants, most have been studied from the perspectives of (un)employment, wage and over-education. Some evidence suggests that skilled migrants are often less satisfied with their job compared to their local counterparts, yet little is known about why these differences exist. Using a nationally representative sample of Australian workers, we examine how two important job characteristics, job security and skill utilization, exert their differential interaction effect on job satisfaction for skilled migrants and Australian born workers. We found a differential moderation effect between job security and skill utilization for skilled migrants and Australian born workers. For skilled migrants, high job security did not lead to positive reaction (i.e., job satisfaction), as this effect was dependent on their skill utilization; while such moderation effect was not present for Australian born workers. This study highlights the need to take a more fine-tuned approach by understanding target sample groups (e.g., skilled migrants) when study the relationship between key job characteristics and job satisfaction. Furthermore, it highlights the importance for organizations to revisit their human resource management strategies and policies to recognize the needs for enhancing skill utilization for skilled migrants."
"Negotiating Indonesian Married Women’s Agency in a Career: Work From Home Arrangement as a Possible Solution Personnel; Teleworker; Flexible Working Financial challenges have led to the emergence of dual-earner couples. Nonetheless, in male-dominated societies like Indonesia, womenâ€™s career involvement, although contributing to the household income, is not correlated with menâ€™s contribution to the household task. A career is seen as a privilege for women because their primary value is conventionally anchored on marriage and family. International studies suggested that the Work From Home (WFH) arrangement is an effective solution to enable women to balance their work and family roles. While WFH was nonexistent in Indonesia before the COVID-19 pandemic, the latter forced companies to adopt the former. This provided an opportunity to examine whether WFH can be a remedy for working Indonesian women to negotiate their work and family roles. Hence this study is aimed to look closely at the issue, comprising two general aims. First, it provides a general picture of current practices of division of gender in Indonesia using current literature. Second, using online survey data from 201 Indonesian workers, this report provides empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of WFH, particularly for married working women in Indonesia in negotiating their work and household roles. While describing current feminism issues in the non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) societies, the article also discusses the long-term practical strategy to empower Indonesian women in careers by emphasizing gender equality while acknowledging the menâ€™s leadership role."
"Livestock's near-term climate impact and mitigation policy implications Meat Consumption; Diet; Livestock Products Human consumption of livestock remains a marginal issue in climate change debates, partly due to the IPCC's arbitrary adoption of 100-year global warming potential framework to compare different emissions, blinding us to the significance of shorter-term emissions, namely methane. Together with the gas it reacts to form - tropospheric ozone - methane has been responsible for 37% of global warming since 1750, yet its atmospheric life is just 10 years. Neglecting its role means overlooking powerful mitigation opportunities. The chapter discusses the role of livestock, the largest anthropogenic methane source, and the need to include reduced meat consumption in climate change responses. Looking beyond the conventional focus on the consumer, we point to some underlying challenges in addressing the meatclimate relationship, including the climate science community's reluctance to adopt a short-term focus in its climate projections. Policy options are presented."
"Physicochemical properties of biochars produced from biosolids in Victoria, Australia Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon Some of the barriers associated with the land application of biosolids generated in wastewater treatment plants can be eliminated simply by converting the biosolids into biochar using a thermal conversion process called â€œpyrolysisâ€. In the current work, eight biosolids from four different wastewater treatment plants in southeast Melbourne, Victoria, Australia were collected and pyrolysed to produce biochars at two different temperatures (500 and 700Â°C). In addition, characterisation studies were carried out on the biochars to obtain their physicochemical properties, which were subsequently compared with the properties of the parent biosolids. The major findings of the work demonstrated that biochars exhibited large decreases in DTPA-extractable metals such as Cd, Cu, and Zn, and also led to favorable changes in several chemical and physical characteristics (i.e., pH, Olsen P, electrical conductivity, and surface area) for agricultural land application compared to their original form (i.e., biosolids). Overall, the study suggests that there is great potential for converting biosolids to biochar using pyrolysis. This may not only improve the properties of biosolids for land application, but also has potential to reduce the risk to receiving environments and, furthermore, eliminate many of the costly elements associated with biosolids stockpiling and management."
"From 'Thinging' to 'Musyawarahing' and beyond Participatory Design; Co-Design; Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) With Participatory Design (PD) increasingly applied across a range of cultural contexts, there is a growing need to better understand the relationship between PD and the many distinct traditional approaches to decision-making PD encounters and the democratic ideals underpinning them. Currently, the PD discourse is strongly tied to Scandinavian democratic history and ideals. Most prominently, contemporary PD literature has drawn links between design and the etymology of the word Äâ‚¬Thing' - a democratic gathering in ancient Northern European societies. While this concept provides a useful lens for planning and analysing PD projects conducted in Scandinavia, other conceptualizations of design might be more useful and appropriate for PD taking place elsewhere. By conducting an initial exploration of traditional approaches to democratic decision-making practiced in parts of the Asia-Pacific, this paper offers a small step towards appreciating the diversity of democratic ideals PD may meet, how PD may adapt to these, and what can be learned from them. The paper, specifically, explores the traditions of musyawarah-mufakat practiced in Indonesia, and to a more limited extend talanoa, berkaul and hui practiced in Fiji, Sumatra, and Aotearoa respectively."
"The changing geography of homelessness: A spatial analysis from 2001 to 2016 Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease â€¢ Homelessness on a per capita basis remains highest in very remote areas but is becoming more dispersed nationally with concentrations in major cities growing over time, particularly in the most populous states (NSW and Victoria). By 2016 capital cities accounted for just under two-thirds of all homelessness nationally. â€¢ Changes in homelessness rates between 2001 and 2016 are largely due to factors specific to regions, with little of the change accounted for by the mix of homelessness operational groups in a region, or overall national trends. â€¢ Homelessness is rising in areas with a shortage of affordable private rental housing and higher median rents. This rise is most acute in capital city areas, specifically, Sydney, Hobart and Melbourne. â€¢ The area supply of affordable private rental housing is statistically significantly associated with the variation in homelessness rates nationally, in capital cities and regional areas. Overcrowding accounts for a large part of this variation across areas after controlling for other area-based attributes. â€¢ The impact of labour markets vary across capital cities, regional towns and remote areas. Overcrowding in capital cities is strongly associated with weak labour markets and poorer areas that have a higher than average concentration of males. However, these associations do not hold for overcrowding in remote areas. â€¢ Nationally and in capital cities rates of overcrowding are highest where there is a concentration of children aged less than 14 years. For other forms homelessness, rates are elevated in areas with high concentrations of those aged between 25 and 40 years. In regional and remote areas, rates of all forms of homelessness are elevated in areas with high proportions of children aged below 14 years. Homelessness is lower in city, regional and remote areas where there is a higher than average concentration of married people. â€¢ Area based overcrowding is most strongly associated with areas that are more culturally and linguistically diverse. The area based share of Indigenous persons remains the strongest determinant of homelessness in remote areas. â€¢ There is substantial mismatch between the distribution of homelessness and specialist homelessness service capacity. Nationally, in 2016, 48 per cent of Specialist Homelessness Services (SHS) accommodation capacity and 44 per cent of support capacity would need to shift across SA3 boundaries to better The risk and experience of homelessness is shaped by the places in which people live and gravitate to, either by choice or necessity. Yet most research has focussed on understanding individually based causes, triggers or pathways into and out of homelessness and its consequences for individuals. This research offers policy makers evidence on the changing geography of homelessness. It outlines the extent to which homelessness is becoming more spatially concentrated over time, where it is rising and falling, and of the importance that housing affordability, poverty and labour market opportunities play in reshaping its distribution over time. It seeks to address the policy question: What structural factors are important in driving changes in the geography of homelessness over the period 2001â€“2016, and is service delivery to those with experience of homelessness matching these spatial dynamics? The following research questions address this policy theme: RQ1: How does the incidence of homelessness and its components vary within and between regions, states and territories, and is it becoming more or less geographically concentrated? RQ2: Is homelessness rising or falling in areas where there are shortages of affordable private rental housing, and are Specialist Homelessness Services (SHS) well located to intervene? RQ3: What role do structural factors such as housing and labour markets, demographics and other area-based indicators, play in shaping differences in rates of homelessness between Australian regions, states and territories over the study period 2001â€“2016?"
"Introduction to advances in UAV avionics for imaging and sensing Controller; Altitude Control; Vertical Takeoff and Landing An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) - aka drone, unmanned aircraft system or remotely piloted aircraft system - is an aircraft without a human pilot on board. Its flight can be controlled autonomously by computers in the vehicle or by remote control. UAVs can uniquely penetrate areas, which may be too dangerous or too difficult to reach for piloted craft. The UAV cyber-physical system comprises all the subsystems and interfaces for processing and communication functions performed by the embedded electronic system (avionics) and the ground control station. To accomplish the desired real-time autonomy, the avionics is highly tied with aerodynamics sensing and actuation. An entirely autonomous UAV can (i) obtain evidence about the environment, (ii) work for an extended period of time without human interference, (iii) move either all or part of itself all over its operating location devoid of human help and (iv) stay away from risky situations for people and their assets. This chapter intends to introduce the material addressed in further chapters of this book. The next sections go through some concepts that are recurrent in the book."
"News media representations of people receiving income support and the production of stigma power: An empirical analysis of reporting on two Australian welfare payments Stigma; Mental Patient; Stereotyping People receiving working-age income support payments are often stigmatised as morally and/or behaviourally deficient. We consider the role of the media, as a potential source of structural stigma, in perpetuating negative characterisations of people in receipt of either the Disability Support Pension (DSP) or unemployment benefits (Newstart) during a major period of welfare reform in Australia. Newspaper articles (N = 8290) that appeared in Australiaâ€™s five largest newspapers between 2001 and 2016, and referenced either payment were analysed. We found an increased use of fraud language associated with the DSP, which coincides with increased political and policy focus on this payment. We conclude that in a period of increasing political concern with welfare reform, media coverage of welfare recipients is a form of stigma power, acting discursively as symbolic violence."
"The occurrence of microplastic in specific organs in commercially caught fishes from coast and estuary area of east China Plastics; Marine Debris; Litter It is important to understand where microplastics go in the body of organisms. They can readily affect target organs and transport microplastic-associated chemicals to humans via consumption. The plastics (>20 Î¼m) in guts and gills of 13 species of fishes from coast estuary areas of China were examined for the presence of microplastics. Muscle and liver were analyzed from a commercial species, the Asian seabass (Lateolabrax maculatus), of which 73% of the suspected items were verified by micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. We targeted the organ specific distribution of microplastics. Microplastics were detected in gut and gills in 22%-100% and 22%-89% of total individuals, respectively. Microplastics in gut varied from 0.3 to 5.3 items/ind. and varied from 0.3 to 2.6 items/ind in gill, respectively. The size of microplastics in gills were smaller than those found in the guts. No microplastics were detected in the liver or muscle tissue of L. maculatus, and several non-plastic items detected in muscles can be attributed to background contamination. Further research is required using a larger number of specimens and better quality control and quality assurance are required to assess the presence of small microplastics or nanoplastics in fishes internal organs and muscle."
"Self-Assembled Peptide Habitats to Model Tumor Metastasis Diphenylalanine; Peptide Nanotubes; Self-Assembly Metastatic tumours are complex ecosystems; a community of multiple cell types, including cancerous cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells that exist within a supportive and specific microenvironment. The interplay of these cells, together with tissue specific chemical, structural and temporal signals within a three-dimensional (3D) habitat, direct tumour cell behavior, a subtlety that can be easily lost in 2D tissue culture. Here, we investigate a significantly improved tool, consisting of a novel matrix of functionally programmed peptide sequences, self-assembled into a scaffold to enable the growth and the migration of multicellular lung tumour spheroids, as proof-of-concept. This 3D functional model aims to mimic the biological, chemical, and contextual cues of an in vivo tumor more closely than a typically used, unstructured hydrogel, allowing spatial and temporal activity modelling. This approach shows promise as a cancer model, enhancing current understandings of how tumours progress and spread over time within their microenvironment."
"Ethnic diversity and transport poverty Public Transport; Accessibility; Transit Transport poverty is a growing concern in many developed countries. However, research on the determinants of transport poverty is relatively scant. We contribute to the debate on the determinants of transport poverty by presenting the first study to empirically examine the effects of ethnic diversity on transport poverty. Using 12 waves of longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, covering the period 2005â€“2016, we find a positive association between ethnic diversity and transport poverty. This result is robust to endogeneity, alternative ways of measuring ethnic diversity and transport poverty. We show that trust is an important channel through which ethnic diversity influences transport poverty. Thus, policies aimed at fostering tolerance, trust and inclusion in diverse communities are important to mitigate the negative effects of ethnic diversity on desirable socioeconomic outcomes."
"Is the tracking error time-varying? Evidence from agricultural ETCs Investor Sentiment; Exchange Traded Funds; Stock Market This study extensively analyses a recently popularized asset class, exchange-traded commodities (ETCs). We demonstrate that the tracking error of ETCs is dependent on the volatility of the underlying commodity prices but not persistent. Furthermore, we find the tracking ability of agricultural ETCs is affected by the replication method and the leverage of the ETCs. Our findings are important for academics and market regulators as they indicate the structure of an ETC and the time-varying volatility of agricultural prices matters for its tracking performance."
"Versatility in sustainable building design (SBD) practices: an empirical study Crime Prevention; Burglary; Environmental Design Purpose: Through an empirical study, this research proposes a multi-dimensional assessment method for Sustainable Building Design (SBD). This approach is adopted to investigate and evaluate the current practices of SBD and to provide a basis for refining such processes while reducing existing shortfalls. In doing so, a holistic sustainable framework for rating the sustainable performance of buildings is proposed. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the aforementioned purpose, this research (1) investigates the most current trends in SBD including the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM); (2) examines the practical issues of SBD; (3) proposes a multi-dimensional assessment method; and (4) compares 18 separate case studies in the three countries of Australia, United Kingdom and USA, as part of the SBD implementation. To compare these case studies, an additional SBD tool, Green Building Rating and Certification System (GBELS) was carefully selected and applied. Five core values of SBD were identified based on functionality, accessibility and productivity, which align with the GBELS outcomes. Findings: This research found that, for the 18 examined buildings, the main issues in SBD in the three countries concerned environmental and ecological issues. These included the impacts of buildings on the environment, as well as issues concerning the buildings' life cycle analysis and assessment. It was also determined that energy usage, pollution reduction and climate change concerns were important inclusions in establishing these buildings, particularly in the USA. Originality/value: To support the research aim, this paper explores the most innovative trends in SBD assessments including their Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), grade (stars) classification, Relative Weight (RW) and particularly GBELS. GBELS was selected for this research, since it is relatively new and there is little available literature discussing its adaptation. Accordingly, this research further evaluates the application of GBELS as a part of versatility in SBD multi-dimensional assessment method. As the basis of these tests, a total of 18 separate case studies are closely evaluated."
"Recent advances in the prediction of fouling in membrane bioreactors Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling Compared to the traditional activated sludge process, the membrane bioreactor (MBR) has several advantages such as the production of high-quality effluent, generation of low excess sludge, smaller footprint requirements, and ease of automatic control of processes. The MBR has a broader prospect of its applications in wastewater treatment and reuse. However, membrane fouling is the biggest obstacle for its wider application. This paper reviews the techniques available to predict fouling in MBR, discusses the problems associated with predicting fouling status using artificial neural networks and mathematical models, summarizes the current state of fouling prediction techniques, and looks into the trends in their development."
"Resilient Senior Russian-Australian Voices: “We Live to Sing and Sing to Live” Art; Prescribing; Dementia This research examines the understandings and meanings of shared music making held by the members of the Young Hearts Russian choir in Melbourne, Australia and its impact on quality of life. The elderly participants in this interpretative phenomenological case data are first generation migrants who speak most strongly in their first language (Russian). Individual semi-structured interviews were undertaken with nine people and focus group discussion involved all 28 choir members. Data collected in their first language revealed stories of survival and resilience in the face of adversity. The findings are reported under two broad themes: Maintaining independence and resilience (Subthemes: The importance of participation, Maintaining â€˜faceâ€™, Overcoming illness and disability, and Becoming a family), and Learning, rehearsing and performing music. Singing together enhances quality of life, combats social isolation, fosters resilience and sense of autonomy, and allows participants to access inner resources to face the challenges of life. Supported and enacted via musical and social engagement, the participants continue to be resilient in older age as they are faced with the consequences of ageing, particularly infirmity and isolation. They remain protective of their independence and resistant to relegation to residential care."
"Zero-carbon steel production: The opportunities and role for Australia Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals The global steel industry is entering a period of change unprecedented in its long history, and Australia, with the globally largest exports of both iron ore and metallurgical coal, must consider its position carefully. Steel production is critical to the support of global economic development and employs sophisticated, mature and highly-optimised blast furnace technology, but is nevertheless responsible for 7â€“9% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Global net-zero pledges mean that the industry cannot proceed with only incremental improvements, and must anticipate major changes to its core processes, or else depend on negative emissions technologies that may cost even more to implement. Transition scenarios in this paper highlight the rate at which â€˜green steelâ€™ technologies would need to be deployed to meet sectoral net-zero targets. The paper shows the co-location of Australia's major iron ore deposits with excellent renewable energy resources, highlighting a potential advantage for local large-scale development of this industry. Deploying the huge renewable energy infrastructure required would lead to potential challenges for global materials supply chains. For Australia to find a strong and ongoing role in this industry, there it will need to consider long-sighted environmental and industrial policies, including R&D funding, project financing and (low-)emissions certification."
"Australian housing market and the Indonesian foreign real estate investment Real Estate Investment Trusts; Risk-adjusted Returns; Stock Market Offshore high net worth investors were active in the Australian property market after the Global Financial Crisis 2008. Indonesia is the direct neighbouring country to Australia and the bilateral investment between the two countries represents an important component of the Australia's foreign relation. During the extensive media coverage on offshore investment in Australia housing market, both the number of wealthy Indonesians and their investments in the Australian housing market were allegedly on an increasing trend. This research intends to uncover the factors that influenced Indonesian investors' decision on the Australian residential property market investment by employing a qualitative semi-structured interview with various senior property professionals and investors from both Australia and Indonesia. Uncertainty in the Indonesian regulatory framework was the major â€œpushâ€ factors that resulted in Indonesians' investment into the Australian residential property market. The wealthy Indonesians overseas property ventures were further encouraged by the favourable Australian â€œpullâ€ factors such as reputable living condition and stable macroeconomic environment. A better understanding on these drivers will assist the policy makers to better grasp the issue related to foreign real estate investment from Indonesia."
"Immersive cartography and post-qualitative inquiry: A speculative adventure in research-creation Education; Posthuman; Materialist Immersive Cartography and Post-Qualitative Inquiry introduces immersive cartography as a transdisciplinary approach to social inquiry in an age of climate change and technological transformation. Drawing together innovative theories and practices from the environmental arts, process philosophy, education studies, and posthumanism, the book frames immersive cartography as a speculative adventure that gradually transformed the physical and conceptual architectures of a university environment. The philosophical works of Alfred North Whitehead, Gilles Deleuze, and Felix Guattari are touchstones throughout the book, seeding the development of concepts that re-imagine the university through a more-than-human ecology of experience. Illustrated by detailed examples from Rousell's artistic interventions and pedagogical experiments in university learning environments, the book offers new conceptual and practical tools for navigating the ontological turn across the social sciences, arts, and humanities. Rousell's wide-ranging and detailed analysis of pedagogical encounters resituates learning as an affective and environmentally distributed process, proposing a ""trans-qualitative"" ethics and aesthetics of inquiry that is orientated toward processual relations and events. As a foothold for a new generation of scholarship in the social sciences, this book opens new directions for research across the fields of post-qualitative inquiry, art and aesthetics, critical university studies, affect theory, and the posthumanities."
"Slag waste incorporation in high early strength concrete as cement replacement: Environmental impact and influence on hydration & durability attributes Concrete Aggregates; Construction and Demolition Waste; Mechanical Properties This paper investigates the effects of incorporating slag waste (Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag; GGBS) as cement replacement in high early strength concrete. GGBS was used in various replacement ratios and resulting properties of the developed concretes were evaluated. Compressive strength, heat of hydration and shrinkage were determined for evaluating hydration attributes while chloride penetrability and carbonation resistance were investigated for studying the durability-related characteristics of the resulting concretes. The optimum ratio of GGBS as SCM has been determined, in this study, as 30% at which there is merely an average strength decline of 11% while reducing the total carbon dioxide emissions by 30%. Similarly, at this replacement level, the decreased chloride ion penetrability (15%) and higher carbonation resistance (3%) further encourage its use in precast concrete incorporating (HESC). Finally, the beneficial effects of using slag waste in concrete were quantified by determining associated CO2 emissions. It is concluded that slag incorporation in concrete significantly reduces the CO2 emissions, (up to 68%) depending on the cement replacement level, thus promoting green construction and sustainable development."
"Effect of community road infrastructure, socio-demographic and street pattern in promoting walking as sustainable transportation mode Built Environment; Mode Choice; Urban Form Background: Traffic demand is growing worldwide and the increased carbon emission from transport and travel activities is contributing to greenhouse gas emission and climate change. As the oil and gas capital of Canada, the city of Calgary has a very high carbon footprint per population and the reduction of automobile use is an important policy goal for the city. Walking, a part of active transportation promotes sustainable transportation initiative by reducing greenhouse gas emission. To encourage walking, favorable walking environment should be ensured which largely depends on street pattern and connectivity. However, the effect of street pattern on walking at community level was not explored much in previous studies, particularly at rapidly expanding city such as Calgaryâ€™s context. Aims and Objectives: The study identifies the effects of different neighborhood design and planning factors associated with the share of walking in work trips while controlling for differences in social economic characteristics of the neighborhood. Methods: A linear regression model was developed using community-level data from the 2011 census and the road infrastructure data of Calgary. Results: Our study finds that different street patterns and types of land use, length of train tracks, number of train stations and number of schools have significant effect on walking. Conclusion: Thus, different neighbourhood street patterns and land uses should be considered in the development of new communities for promoting active and sustainable transportation."
"Regulating for gender-equitable decent work in social and community services: Bringing the state back in Social Support; Social Care; Direct Payments This article explores the potential of regulatory and policy reform for gender-equitable decent work in social and community services, a rapidly growing sector of female employment in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Along with other feminised sectors, employment in this sector is marked by low rates of unionisation, poor pay and fragmented, insecure working hours. Internationally, gig economy work is now appearing in the sector. A distinguishing feature of the sector is employersâ€™ reliance on government funding through contracted services or via direct payments to individuals. The distance of government from accountability for workers in publicly funded services directly contributes to gendered undervaluation and poor working conditions. However, the presence of the state also provides options for regulatory reform. This article considers the different roles played by government, as employment regulator, as funding and bargaining actor and as market manager and care regulator. Adopting a broad conception of regulation, it canvasses options for bringing the state back in to address gender inequality and precarious work. In the Australian context, it examines potential for rebuilding state accountability for gender-equitable decent work in individualised social care in which the gender inequalities and poor working conditions present in social and community services are amplified."
"Auditor and auditee engagement with public sector performance audit: An institutional logics perspective Public Sector; Auditors; Audit Office In the context of contemporary public sector performance audit practice in Australia, this study provides significant insights into performance auditorsâ€™ and auditeesâ€™ apparent logics and attitudes to performance audits. Employing a documentary analysis and in-depth semistructured interviews with senior audit leaders from all Australian Auditor-General jurisdictions, performance auditorsâ€™ and auditeesâ€™ attitudes toward performance audits and their intentions, strategies, and responses were explored through the lens of institutional logics. Empirical evidence reveals that performance auditorsâ€™ logics have gradually moved toward greater stakeholder engagement with auditees, parliamentarians, and the media, while preserving their performance audit prerogatives. Auditees appear to become more receptive to performance auditorsâ€™ engagement strategies and consultation attempts if auditors maintain a collaborative attitude. Both parties occasionally apply bridging and buffering strategies in situations where their logics are not aligned with those of the other stakeholder group. This study discovered that competing logics held by performance auditors and auditees are in some respects drawn closer together, while differences nonetheless co-exist, although often in an uneasy partnership."
"Budgeting reconsidered: exploring change initiative in a bank Balanced Score Card; Management Control Systems; Strategic Management Accounting Purpose: This study aims to explore and understand a beyond budgeting-inspired initiative to abandon budgeting in a multinational bank. Design/methodology/approach: Analysing data from semi-structured interviews with actors involved in and affected by the change initiative, this paper draws on Kasurinenâ€™s accounting change framework as well as concepts from institutional theory to investigate the rationale for and the challenges of budget abandonment. Findings: Although the improving financial market stability and the increasing accountability of banks after the global financial crisis motivated the initial organisational changes, the appointment of a head of finance with experience of beyond budgeting was a major catalyst of change. This change-promoting leader was of utmost importance in providing relevant training and support, facilitating the change initiative and overcoming the initial resistance to change. However, the remnants of former budgeting practice did not regress as intended, and the change initiative stalled. Originality/value: This research contributes to beyond budgeting and accounting change studies by illustrating a stalled change initiative in the context susceptible to beyond budgeting ideas and highlighting the importance of aligning discourse and meaning with practice and routines."
"Transforming community well-being through patients' lived experiences Product-service Systems; Service Economy; Value Co-Creation The purpose of this article is to (1) explicate micro-to-meso linkages of well-being, (2) provide a theoretical framework to guide research on connecting patient experiences to community well-being, and (3) offer guidelines to policymakers. We develop a conceptual framework establishing connections between micro and meso levels through the expansion of patients' lived ecosystems. We introduce the concept of patient ecosystem management (PEM), an organizational process that focuses on treating patients differently in terms of assessing, managing, and expanding resources to achieve patient health and well-being goals. This process establishes a foundational perspective that is necessary to connect patients' ecosystems and to facilitate community well-being. Theoretically, this research creates ties between micro-level interactions and a collective measure (community well-being). Policymakers and healthcare professionals should take a PEM perspective, which will require new roles and behaviors, and leverage technology to expand and overlap patients' individual service ecosystems (intra-alignment), thus enlarging community well-being (inter-alignment)."
"Listening for futures along Birrarung Marr: speculative immersive experience in environmental education Emotion; Cultural Geography; Field Work This paper considers experiences of speculative immersion as artists and children map the multilayered sonic ecology of Birrarung Marr, a traditional meeting place for Aboriginal language groups of the Eastern Kulin Nation. We explore how speculative practices of immersion shaped the mapping of precolonial, contemporary, and future soundscapes of Birrarung Marr, and the ceremonial burial of these sonic cartographies for future listeners. Bringing together Indigenous and non-Indigenous concepts of immersion in mutually respectful and purposeful conversation, we work to re-theorise immersive experience as a process of ecological multiplicity and affective resonance, rather than one of phenomenological containment. By approaching immersion as both a concept and a sensation that ruptures the boundary between body and environment, we follow how immersion 'drifts' across porous thresholds of sensing, thinking, dreaming, making, and knowing in situated environmental education contexts. In doing so, the paper stresses the importance of speculative immersive experience in cultivating liveable urban futures under conditions of climate change, and responds to the need for new understandings of immersion that take more-than-human ecologies of experience into account."
"Metals extraction processes from electronic waste: constraints and opportunities E-Waste; Electronic Waste; Electronic Equipment The skyrocketing demand and progressive technology have increased our dependency on electrical and electronic devices. However, the life span of these devices has been shortened because of rapid scientific expansions. Hence, massive volumes of electronic waste (e-waste) is generating day by day. Nevertheless, the ongoing management of e-waste has emerged as a major threat to sustainable economic development worldwide. In general, e-waste contains several toxic substances such as metals, plastics, and refractory oxides. Metals, particularly lead, mercury, nickel, cadmium, and copper along with some valuable metals such as rare earth metals, platinum group elements, alkaline and radioactive metal are very common; which can be extracted before disposing of the e-waste for reuse. In addition, many of these metals are hazardous. Therefore, e-waste management is an essential issue. In this study, we critically have reviewed the existing extraction processes and compared among different processes such as physical, biological, supercritical fluid technologies, pyro and hydrometallurgical, and hybrid methods used for metals extraction from e-waste. The review indicates that although each method has particular merits but hybrid methods are eco-friendlier with extraction efficiency > 90%. This study also provides insight into the technical challenges to the practical realization of metals extraction from e-waste sources. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]"
"Study on the Carbon Footprint Reduction Through Recycling Activities in UTHM: Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic ARIMA; Mathematical Modeling; COVID-19 Recycling is an excellent method to manage institutional solid waste and reduce the environmental carbon footprint. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented chaos and affected recycling activities in UTHM. Therefore, the trend of carbon reduction through recycling activities in UTHM was determined to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the trend of carbon reduction. The data was collected from the recycling center in UTHM and the carbon reduction was further calculated to compare the difference before and after the pandemic outbreak. The weight of paper products collected was the highest, accounting for more than 75%, while the weight of aluminium collected was the lowest, accounting for less than 1%. Furthermore, it was found that the trend of carbon reduction increased steadily in 2019. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused the trend to plunge and approach zero in March 2020. Nevertheless, once the COVID-19 pandemic was under control, the carbon reduction trend improved and peaked again in 2021. In addition, paper products achieved the highest of the total carbon reduction at 5143.072 tCO2e while aluminium was the lowest at 0.357 tCO2e. The highest total carbon reduction was achieved in 2019 with 1980.168 tCO2e while the lowest was recorded in 2020 with 1220.932 tCO2e. As a result, the Covid-19 Pandemic had a significant impact on the recycling rate in UTHM, which resulted in a reduction in the total amount of carbon reduction."
"Embedding Pinhole Vertical Gold Nanowire Electronic Skins for Braille Recognition Strain Sensor; Flexible Electronics; Sensor Electronic skins (e-skins) have the potential to be conformally integrated with human body to revolutionize wearable electronics for a myriad of technical applications including healthcare, soft robotics, and the internet of things, to name a few. One of the challenges preventing the current proof of concept translating to real-world applications is the device durability, in which the strong adhesion between active materials and elastomeric substrate or human skin is required. Here, a new strategy is reported to embed vertically aligned standing gold nanowires (v-AuNWs) into polydimethylsiloxane, leading to a robust e-skin sensor. It is found that v-AuNWs with pinholes can have an adhesion energy 18-fold greater than that for pinhole-free v-AuNWs. Finite element modeling results show that this is due to friction force from interfacial embedment. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the robust e-skin sensor can be used for braille recognition."
"Experimental and DFT studies of gadolinium decorated graphene oxide materials for their redox properties and as a corrosion inhibition barrier layer on Mg AZ13 alloy in a 3.5% NaCl environment Corrosion Protection; Graphene Oxide; Corrosion Resistant Coatings Magnesium alloys are broadly used worldwide in various applications; however, the serious disadvantage of these alloys are subject to corrosion and in aggressive/corrosive environments. A coating containing gadolinium-based composite materials can increase the alloy protection by strong electron transfer between the host alloy and the lanthanide-containing protective layer. This investigation aims to develop a Gd nanorod functionalised graphene oxide material as a corrosion inhibition barrier on the Mg alloy surface. The obtained functional materials were characterised by various spectroscopy techniques. The corrosion inhibition and composite material stability were studied by the electrochemical methods. The electrochemical stability was shown to increase with the applied current. The hydrogen evolution constantly increased and the corrosion inhibition significantly improved. Also, the computational studies of the material were performed, and their results support the experimental findings. Overall, the resultant composite material's corrosion resistance and cyclic stability are improved, and it could be used as a sodium-ion battery cathode material due to its high reversibility.

"Development of a turbo electric distribution system for remotely piloted aircraft systems High Speed; Permanent Magnets; Eddy Currents Turboelectric distributed propulsion systems are paving the way for more electric aircraft systems (TeDP). This type of system provides a solution for some of the drawbacks of current low-energy-density batteries, which limit the ability of long-endurance electric aircraft. However, turboelectric propulsion requires the use of advanced turboelectric motors, superconductive materials and cryogenic cooling technologies, which are still under development and may be in production in the near future. This paper investigates a turboelectric propulsion system that can be considered an initial step in the production of TeDP in a remotely piloted aircraft system with the use of existing technology. This is achieved by replacing the gear and the starter motor of a turboprop with a high-speed permanent magnet electric machine to generate electrical power and propelling the aircraft through a distributed electric propulsion system. In this theoretical study, an augmentation to Breguetâ€™s range and endurance equation is developed. This study confirmed that the new system is 31% lighter than the turboprop engine. Then the effect of the weight savings is used in the distributed electric propulsion (DEP) aerodynamic studies and found that there is a drastic increase in the range for a TeDP developed with the high-speed machine."
"Nurses’ Perceived Facilitators of Research Utilisation in a Multicultural Setting in Saudi Arabia: Observational Study Evidence-Based Practice; Nursing Research; Nurses Facilitators of research utilisation are important in the implementation of evidence-based practice. Numerous facilitators for nursing practice have been identified, but knowledge of the impact of demographic characteristics on these enablers of research utilisation is limited. The studyâ€™s aim was to determine nursesâ€™ perceptions of the facilitators of research utilisation and assess differences in the facilitator of research utilisation score based on nursesâ€™ demographic characteristics. A total of 2650 registered nurses from five hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were recruited for participation. A facilitator scale and self-designed demographic survey were used for data collection. The number of completed questionnaires was 1824 (69%). The results showed that many of the participants were female, aged between 20 to 40 years, and were expatriates mainly from the Philippines. Most respondents were clinical nurses with 6 to 10 years of experience. Many of the nurses had a bachelorâ€™s degree and a qualification from the Asian region. The mean total facilitator score was 26.1, with strong facilitators of research, including advanced education, providing colleague support, more clinically focused research and employing nurses with research skills. Recommendations for the facilitation of research utilisation include a strengthening of the research curriculum in nursing education programs as well as through continuing professional education."
"Vocational education and the revitalisation of manufacturing in the United States Apprenticeship Training; Firm; Human Capital Theory Manufacturing in advanced open economies has experienced significant disruption. Rapid technological change, outsourcing and off shoring have beset manufacturing resulting in a general and steady decline in manufacturing employment. Despite this turbulence, there remains a strong nostalgia for manufacturing resulting in frequent public policy discussion about how best to revitalise the industry. A popular view is that a strong manufacturing industry relies upon an equally strong vocational, education and training (VET) system to provide requisite skill needs. Given the dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing industry do such arguments still hold true? This paper considers this question through an examination of what the revitalisation of US manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and the extent to which USâ€™s decentralised and largely eroded VET system serves as a barrier to the industryâ€™s revitalisation. Drawing upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and secondary data collected in three US cities, the paper argues that the focus on needing to have a strong VET system overlooks the emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems that evolve to address local skill needs. These micro skill eco-systems open the prospects for skills and training innovations to meet changing workforce needs in a changing industry."
"Comparative root transcriptomics provide insights into drought adaptation strategies in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) Cicer; Ascochyta; Genetic Variability Drought adversely affects crop production across the globe. The root system immensely contributes to water management and the adaptability of plants to drought stress. In this study, drought-induced phenotypic and transcriptomic responses of two contrasting chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) genotypes were compared at the vegetative, reproductive transition, and reproductive stages. At the vegetative stage, drought-tolerant genotype maintained higher root biomass, length, and surface area under drought stress as compared to sensitive genotype. However, at the reproductive stage, root length and surface area of tolerant genotype was lower but displayed higher root diameter than sensitive genotype. The shoot biomass of tolerant genotype was overall higher than the sensitive genotype under drought stress. RNA-seq analysis identified genotype-and developmental-stage specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to drought stress. At the vegetative stage, a total of 2161 and 1873 DEGs, and at reproductive stage 4109 and 3772 DEGs, were identified in the tolerant and sensitive genotypes, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed enrichment of biological categories related to cellular process, metabolic process, response to stimulus, response to abiotic stress, and response to hormones. Interestingly, the expression of stress-responsive transcription factors, kinases, ROS signaling and scavenging, transporters, root nodulation, and oxylipin biosynthesis genes were robustly upregulated in the tolerant genotype, possibly contributing to drought adaptation. Furthermore, activation/repression of hormone signaling and biosynthesis genes was observed. Overall, this study sheds new insights on drought tolerance mechanisms operating in roots with broader implications for chickpea improvement."
"ROBUST TECHNIQUES FOR BUILDING FOOTPRINT EXTRACTION IN AERIAL LASER SCANNING 3D POINT CLOUDS Aerial Image; Lidar; Point Cloud The building footprint is crucial for a volumetric 3D representation of a building that is applied in urban planning, 3D city modeling, cadastral and topographic map generation. Aerial laser scanning (ALS) has been recognized as the most suitable means of large-scale 3D point cloud data (PCD) acquisition. PCD can produce geometric detail of a scanned surface. However, it is almost impossible to get point clouds without noise and outliers. Besides, data incompleteness and occlusions are two common phenomena for PCD. Most of the existing methods for building footprint extraction employ classification, segmentation, voting techniques (e.g., Hough-Transform or RANSAC), or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based methods. It is known that classical PCA is highly sensitive to outliers, even RANSAC which is known as a robust technique for shape detection is not free from outlier effects. This paper presents a novel algorithm that employs MCMD (maximum consistency within minimum distance), MSAC (a robust variant of RANSAC) and a robust regression to extract reliable building footprints in the presence of outliers, missing points and irregular data distributions. The algorithm is successfully demonstrated through two sets of ALS PCD."
"Effect of composition on the tensile and corrosion performance of nickel aluminium bronze produced via laser powder bed fusion Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Nickel Aluminium Bronze (NAB) is a key material for marine applications due to its combination of high strength and superior corrosion resistance in seawater. While wrought components show enhanced strength and corrosion resistance compared to their cast equivalent, casting is often required in order to achieve necessary component shapes. This study investigates the potential manufacturing of NAB components through laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), which is known for its ability to create highly complex designs. NAB powders with compositions C63000 (Cu-10.2Al-4.8Fe-5.0Ni-0.2Si, wt%) and C95800 (Cu-9.0Al-4.0Fe-4.6Ni-1.9Mn, wt%), were tested for their manufacturability, mechanical performance, and corrosion behaviour in both as-built and heat treated conditions. As-built NAB shows a dominant Î²â€² martensitic structure, which is unique to L-PBF due to the rapid heating/cooling rates of laser processing and leads to very high strength in excess of 1100 MPa but brittle performance. After heat treatment, the Î²â€² decomposes into lamellar ÎºIII which breaks down into a dense mixture of laths and particles through spheroidization. This allows AM NAB to attain the same tensile and corrosion behaviour as the wrought equivalent. As built C95800 has greater elongation but lower strength and worse corrosion performance compared to NAB owing to the formation of continuous soft and ductile Î± bands around Î²â€² grains. After heat treatment, the prior Î± regions correspond to globular nickel rich spheroids and iron rich precipitates similar to ÎºIV. This causes heat treated C95800 to show similar tensile performance to cast NAB, while the corrosion behaviour remains similar to wrought."
"Untreated rice husk ash incorporated high strength self-compacting concrete: Properties and environmental impact assessments Cement; Rice Hulls; Mortar The suitability of untreated rice husk ash (URHA) as a supplementary to the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and fine aggregates (FA) in high strength self-compacting concrete (SCC) was investigated in terms of mechanical properties as well as environmental impact assessments (EIA). In total, nine SCC mixes were prepared and investigated with various levels of URHA replacements to OPC and FA. Initially, the fresh and hardened properties of URHA incorporated SCC were determined. Further, EIAs were carried out considering eighteen different environmental impact indices for the optimum URHA incorporated SCC mixes to determine the most appropriate mix in terms of mechanical properties along with their environmental impacts. The experimental results reveal, URHA in the range of 10â€“15% can be used without compromising the fresh and hardened properties of SCC. The results of the EIAs are presented and discussed in terms of compressive strength to environmental indices ratios to normalise the comparison. The EIAs disclose that even through some of the mixes provide better performance in terms of certain environmental impact categories; especially CO2 emission, water pollution (fresh and marine) and ecotoxicity, their strength to environmental impact ratios are relatively low. Thus, it is recommended to select the optimum mix design of URHA incorporated high strength SCC in terms of mechanical properties and as well as EIA."

"Higher Education in Times of Instability and Disruption: Rethinking Notions of Values, Value Creation and Instructional Practices in Vietnam and beyond Employability; Competency; Soft Skills The disruptive nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a massive shift in instructional practices in higher education across the globe. The impact of this pandemic on education globally has led to a surge in online teaching and the use of various digital technologies and platforms to support instructional practices. However, this world-changing event has foregrounded the limitations of technology in addition to other important indications, particularly as it relates to the notion of value and by extension value creation. Within the context of the Vietnamese higher education ecosystem, what is evident is that a re-evaluation of values is worth considering, in terms of the value of local higher education institutions, in addition to the value creation produced by the same. This article will engage with pertinent implications for the post-COVID realities which offer untold challenges and opportunities in Vietnam and elsewhere. Moreover, the post-COVID realities of late modernity only serve to accentuate the importance of values and value creation in this context as higher education institutions would re-evaluate, rethink, and retool approaches to instructional practices. A focus on questions of value aids in considering the broader conditions and contexts which support some of the fruitful and situated outcomes of higher education which includes human capital development, employment, social mobility and the production of modern social identities."
"Greater Knowledge Enhances Complainant Credibility and Increases Jury Convictions for Child Sexual Assault Child Sexual Abuse; Disclosure; Cross Examination Child sexual assault (CSA) cases reliant on uncorroborated testimony yield low conviction rates. Past research demonstrated a strong relationship between verdict and juror CSA knowledge such as typical delays in reporting by victims, and perceived victim credibility. This trial simulation experiment examined the effectiveness of interventions by an expert witness or an educative judicial direction in reducing jurors' CSA misconceptions. Participants were 885 jurors in New South Wales, Australia. After viewing a professionally acted video trial, half the jurors rendered individual verdicts and half deliberated in groups of 8â€“12 before completing a post-trial questionnaire. Multilevel structural equation modeling exploring the relationship between CSA knowledge and verdict demonstrated that greater CSA knowledge after the interventions increased the odds ratio to convict by itself, and that the judicial direction predicted a higher level of post-trial CSA knowledge in jurors than other expert interventions. Moreover, greater CSA knowledge was associated with heightened credibility perceptions of the complainant and a corroborating witness. At the conclusion of the trial, the more jurors knew about CSA, the higher the perceived credibility of both the complainant and her grandmother, and the more likely jurors were to convict the accused."
"Designer Ecosystems for the Anthropocene—Deliberately Creating Novel Ecosystems in Cultural Landscapes Anthropocene; Climate Change; Environment Crisis Accepting that nature and culture are intricately co-evolved has profound implications for the ethical, legal, philosophical and pragmatic dimensions of social and environmental policy. The way we think about nature affects how we understand and manage ecosystems. While the ideals of preserving wilderness and conserving ecosystems have motivated much conservation effort to date, achieving these ideals may not be feasible under Anthropocene conditions unless communities accept custodial responsibilities for landscapes and other species. This paperâ€™s origins are in the authorâ€™s work with the Martuwarra Fitzroy River Council representing Indigenous traditional owners in Australiaâ€™s Kimberley region. These landscapes, shaped by 60,000 years of human occupation, interweave knowledge, laws and governance regimes, and material and spiritual connections with country. This interweaving offers insights into options for dealing with humanityâ€™s complex sustainability challenges. The paper also draws on the literature about cultural landscapes, ecological design, agroecology and permaculture to explore options for applying ecological design as a planning and problem-solving framework. The paper concludes that design-based approaches offer significant opportunities for using ecological science to integrate conservation and production in agricultural landscapes in ways that can meet human needs while also conserving biodiversity under climate change."
"Local area crime and energy poverty Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Energy poverty is a distinct form of poverty that the International Energy Agency estimates could affect as many as one billion people globally. In high-income countries, it is primarily an affordability issue resulting from some combination of having low-income, high expenditure on energy and living in energy inefficient buildings. Rates of energy poverty are typically higher in low-income neighborhoods, in which local area crime rates are also higher. Here, we match longitudinal data at the household level with local area crime rates to estimate the causal effect of local area crime on the probability of being in energy poverty. Our baseline estimates suggest that a standard deviation increase in crime rate causes a 4â€“5% increase in the likelihood of being in energy poverty. Our instrumental variable estimates are considerably higher, suggesting these are lower bound estimates. We find that social capital, perceived safety and physical activity are channels through which crime influences energy poverty and that being internal on Locus of Control dampens the effect of crime on energy poverty."
"A human-centred assessment framework to prioritise heat mitigation efforts for active travel at city scale Street Trees; Urban Forests; Green Infrastructure Hot weather not only impacts upon human physical comfort and health, but also impacts the way that people access and experience active travel options such as walking and cycling. By evaluating the street thermal environment of a city alongside an assessment of those communities that are the most vulnerable to the effects of heat, we can prioritise areas in which heat mitigation interventions are most needed. In this paper, we propose a new approach for policy makers to determine where to delegate limited resources for heat mitigation with most effective outcomes for the communities. We use eye-level street panorama images and community profiles to provide a bottom-up, human-centred perspective of the city scale assessment, highlighting the situation of urban tree shade provision throughout the streets in comparison with environmental and social-economic status. The approach leverages multiple sources of spatial data including satellite thermal images, Google street view (GSV) images, land use and demographic census data. A deep learning model was developed to automate the classification of streetscape types and percentages at the street- and eye-view level. The methodology is metrics based and scalable which provides a data driven assessment of heat-related vulnerability. The findings of this study first contribute to sustainable development by developing a method to identify geographical areas or neighbourhoods that require heat mitigation; and enforce policies improving tree shade on routes, as a heat adaptation strategy, which will lead to increasing active travel and produce significant health benefits for residents. The approach can be also used to guide post COVID-19 city planning and design."
"Shifts to Global Development: Is this a reframing of power, agency, and progress? Sustainable Development Goals; Agenda; United Nations This special section on global development has been developed from a conference roundtable event run by the Development Geographies Research Group of the Royal Geographical Society. In this special section, we (some of the committee) introduce the four papers and their critical contributions to emerging debates. These extend early work on how the â€œglobalâ€ is being made, focusing on the projects of multilateral development agencies and state institutions to examine how (and whether) the rebranding of â€œinternational developmentâ€ as â€œglobal developmentâ€ constitutes a shift in thinking and practice. Together, the papers draw our attention to the considerable opportunities and implications that this reframing offers, while highlighting that critical attention is required as to how that framing is deployed and by whom. They reveal disparity between global development as a much-needed reframing of power, agency, and progress and global development as produced by mainstream development actors and interventions, necessitating more critical research into how this normative agenda is adopted and enacted in dominant policy and practice."
"Making home or making do: a critical look at homemaking without a home Homelessness; Assisted Living Facilities; Mental Disease This paper critically examines the concept of alternative forms of â€˜homemakingâ€™ among people without a settled home. The introductory section establishes the framework for the paper, providing an overview of homelessness and the homemaking literature. Strengths in the homemaking approach are identified, which reconceptualises homelessness as a human-centered phenomenon that can be understood as â€˜resistanceâ€™ to societies that block accesses to mainstream housing for people who are (also) socially and economically marginalised. Homemaking moves beyond mainstream academic analyses which explore homelessness in terms of â€˜sinâ€™ (addiction and criminality), â€˜sicknessâ€™ (poor health, especially poor mental health) and â€˜systemsâ€™ (housing market failure and inadequate social protection and public health systems). The paper argues that, while important in refreshing our thinking about homelessness by offering a new, radical epistemology of housing, homemaking is limited by not contextualising the dwelling practices it seeks to explain, particularly in respect of how it defines â€˜homelessnessâ€™ and also risks misinterpreting transitory behavioural adaptations as something deeper."

Furthermore, the recommendations of this research would assist policymakers in Africa to beer address governance challenges and work towards achieving the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development."
"SPH simulation of natural convection in a modeled reactor core using a new combinatorial kernel Numerical Methods; Particle Method; Free Surface Flow A new kernel function, a combination of a polynomial term and a reciprocal term, is proposed in this work for the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation. A dam-break case is used to validate the new kernel, and satisfactory consistent results between the current method and the existed both experimental and numerical profiles have been obtained. Then, the current method has been used to simulate the natural convection flow and heat transfer in modeled reactors. Various temperature differences, channel numbers, and channel length have been considered for comparative study. Both the water particle trajectories, velocities, and temperature fields have been obtained. To perform better statistics, a mapping method from current Lagrangian results onto Eulerian grids has been proposed by using the new kernel again. The mean and root-mean-square quantities have been analyzed to show the basic characteristics of water's recycling flow in accompany by convective heat transfer."
"Recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic membrane bioreactor using degassing membrane contactors Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling At present, the recovery and utilization of methane from anaerobic wastewater treatment systems as a source of energy are well-researched and widely adopted for a more sustainable system approach. However, not all methane produced in an anaerobic treatment system is completely recovered; subsequently, dissolved methane present in the effluent can be released into the environment and contribute to greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere and reduce the system's methane yield. Many studies have already investigated and discussed the factors affecting the production of dissolved methane, as well as the techniques for its recovery. Among the recovery techniques, the use of degassing membrane contactor is most preferred for wastewater treatment application. However, reported data in the literature is limited to certain types of wastewater characteristics and anaerobic systems. Studies on membrane-based recovery of dissolved methane from AnMBR effluents are reviewed in this paper. For the case of the degassing membrane contactor, porous, or micro-porous membranes provides higher dissolved methane recovery efficiency than non-porous. However, porous membranes are more susceptible to pore wetting problem. Among the different operating conditions of degassing membrane contactors, liquid velocity, or flow rate greatly affects the recovery, wherein higher velocity decreases the recovery efficiency of dissolved methane. Consequently, research priorities aimed at development of degassing membrane to accommodate higher liquid velocity and to reduce pore wetting. Moreover, energy analysis of the AnMBR with degassing membrane system should be analyzed for performance in full-scale applications."
"Evaluating Satellite Soil Moisture Datasets for Drought Monitoring in Australia and the South-West Pacific Microwave; Soil Moisture; Brightness Temperature Soil moisture (SM) is critical in monitoring the time-lagged impacts of agrometeorological drought. In Australia and several south-west Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS), there are a limited number of in situ SM stations that can adequately assess soil-water availability in a near-real-time context. Satellite SM datasets provide a viable alternative for SM monitoring and agrometeorological drought provision in these regions. In this study, we investigated the performance of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Soil Moisture Operational Products System (SMOPS), SM from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2) and SM from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) over Australia and south-west Pacific SIDS. Products were first evaluated in Australia, given the presence of several in-situ SM monitoring stations and a state-of-the-art hydrological modelâ€”the Australian Water Resources Assessment Landscape modelling system (AWRA-L). We further investigated the accuracy of SM satellite datasets in Australia and the south-west Pacific through Triple Collocation analysis with two other SM reference datasetsâ€”ERA5 reanalysis SM data and model data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) dataset. All datasets have differing observation periods ranging from 1911-now, with a common period of observations between 2015â€“2021. Results demonstrated that ASCAT and SMOS were consistently superior in their performance. Analysis in the six south-west Pacific SIDS indicated reduced performance for all products, with ASCAT and SMOS still performing better than others for most SIDS with median R values ranging between 0.3â€“0.9. We conducted a case study of the 2015 El NiÃ±o and Positive Indian Ocean Dipole-induced drought in Papua New Guinea. It was shown that ASCAT is a valuable dataset indicative of agrometeorological drought for the nation, highlighting the value of using satellite SM products to provide early warning of drought in data-sparse regions in the south-west Pacific."
"New Normal or Old Problems? “Hibernation” and Planning for Music Careers in the Victorian Music Industries during COVID-19 Cultural Economy; Freelancer; Art Compared to many nations in the global metropole, Australia experienced low per capita cases of the novel coronavirus during 2020. However, despite the nationâ€™s geographical isolation, its dependence on international travel did result in a number of infections in early 2020, prompting federal and state governments to impose travel restrictions, social distancing orders, and eventually some state-wide lockdowns. The strategy to help affected businesses and workers was a combination of income support, tax relief and economic incentives to spur on spending as businesses were able to again operateâ€”an approach that became known as â€œhibernationâ€. This article examines music workersâ€™ expectations for their future, and the future of the music industries, post-â€œhibernationâ€. Through surveying and interviewing workers and business owners from across the Victorian music industries during a period of lockdown, it is explored how workers position themselves in relation to the idea that the sector could return to â€œnormalâ€ post-COVID, and these responses are situated within creative work research. Without common spaces of socialization and common economic objectives, workers within the hibernated music industries have demonstrated individualized approaches to their career planning, fragmented by the breakdown of daily rituals and routines. Some workers are orienting themselves to a future where the sector re-opens mostly unchanged, while others believe that the industry will be fundamentally different post-COVID. Workersâ€™ activities in lockdown are shaped by these beliefs, with many exiting or preparing for an exit from music work, while those who anticipate staying undertake extensive labour to ensure the viability of their careers. The article concludes by considering what this might mean for the future of live music events in Victoria."
Sentiment and stock market connectedness: Evidence from the U.S. – China trade war Investor Sentiment; Exchange Traded Funds; Stock Market We assess the impact of monthly and daily investor sentiment on stock market return and volatility connectedness during the U.S.-China trade war period. Our analyses focus on the connectedness between the two economies and their major trading partners. We also investigate the asymmetric impact of sentiment on volatility connectedness by exploring the upside and downside markets separately. We consistently document a negative relationship between investor sentiment and stock market connectedness for both return and volatility. We further confirm that investor sentiment exerts a larger impact on volatility connectedness in the downside market compared to the upside market.
"Fog computing as a critical link between a central cloud and iot in support of fast discovery of new hydrocarbon reservoirs Cloud Computing; Indoleacetic Acids; Configuration Management The overall process of discovering hydrocarbon traps, starting with geological exploration through to Seismic Data Processing (SDP) is very expensive and time consuming. In the real-world, the oil and gas production relies on how soon seismic data is computationally processed. The ability for an oil and gas company to perform seismic computation at higher speed within shorter time provides competitive advantage in the race to discover new hydrocarbon reservoirs. We are convinced that the current state of research in areas such as cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing will make a major change. The goal of this paper is to present the first step towards the development of such a three-level system and show its feasibility in the context of a model for hydrocarbon exploration and discovery operation."
"A lightweight authentication scheme for vehicular ad hoc networks based on MSR Network Security; Location Privacy; Revocation Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) has become a promising technology for nowadays' intelligent transportation system (ITS). Secure communications in VANETs can help improve safe and comfortable driving environment for drivers. In order to guarantee secure communication, security, privacy, and efficiency should be carefully considered during the deployment of VANETs. In this paper, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving authentication scheme to enhance the communication security in VANETs. The proposed scheme employs the modular square root (MSR) technique to achieve the design goals. The security analysis demonstrates that our scheme achieves more advantages on supporting mutual authentication and other security requirements by comparing with existing schemes. We also provide the authentication proof using BAN logic and analyze the security validation using ProVerif. Additionally, compared with existing schemes, our scheme significantly reduces the computation delay on message signing and verification by at least 150 times. Meanwhile, the communication cost of our scheme achieves a reduction of nearly 25%."
"Reduced tubular degradation of glomerular filtered plasma albumin is a common feature in acute and chronic kidney disease Albumins; Megalin; Intrinsic Factor-Cobalamin Receptor Tubular epithelial cells take up and degrade plasma albumin filtered by the glomerulus. Tubular damage resulting in reduced albumin uptake or degradation has been suggested as one mechanism contributing to albuminuria in kidney disease. This study investigated whether tubular albumin uptake or degradation is altered in acute and chronic glomerular disease. Mouse models of acute glomerular injury (anti-GBM disease and LPS-induced albuminuria) and chronic disease (streptozotocin-induced diabetes and db/db mice) were examined. Mice were injected intravenously with Alexa-albumin plus DQ-albumin and killed 20 minutes later. Tubular uptake of albumin (Alexa-albumin) and albumin degradation (Dye Quenched (DQ)-albumin) was assessed in tissue sections via confocal microscopy. Tubular uptake of Alexa-albumin in the models of diabetic nephropathy was not different to normal mice. However, the fluorescence signal resulting from degradation of DQ-albumin was significantly reduced in db/db mice, and the ratio of degraded to intact albumin was reduced in both models. The ratio of degraded to intact albumin in tubules was also reduced in the anti-GBM model. In the LPS model, both tubular uptake and degradation of albumin were significantly reduced, with a substantial reduction in the ratio of degraded to intact albumin in tubules. LPS stimulation of cultured tubular epithelial cells inhibited albumin uptake, indicating a direct role for LPS in modifying tubular handling of albumin. In conclusion, reduced degradation of filtered albumin in the proximal tubule is a common feature of glomerular diseases. This may be a general mechanism whereby tubular dysfunction contributes to the development of albuminuria."
"Probing influence factors of implementation patterns for sustainable land consolidation: Insights from seventeen years of practice in Jiangsu province, China Land Consolidation; Agriculture; Cadastres Land consolidation is a key measure in the implementation of agricultural sustainability and has a strategic importance in farmland fragmentation reduction and rural revitalization. In order to understand spatiotemporal patterns of land consolidation implementation and their influences at a large scale, a comprehensive evaluation of 1046 land consolidation projects was conducted in Jiangsu Province, China. The results of this study showed that the construction scale (CS) and investment amount (IA) rose in waves in Jiangsu province during the period 2001-2017, while the newly increased farmland rate (NIFR) continued to decline. Spatial patterns of land consolidation aggregated, whereas the scale and the kernel density of the newly increased farmland area (NIFA) was differentiated in different time periods. In addition, the regional differentiation was significant. The gravity center of CS, IA, and NIFA moved with an overall trend from South Jiangsu to North Jiangsu, and finally stopped at the Li-Xia River plain area in North Jiangsu. The key factors that promoted land consolidation included natural farmland quality and the proportion of the primary industry production in GDP. The potential of NIFA, the farmland production amount, and the income of the financial transferring payment were also important factors. Spatial patterns were initially influenced by natural conditions and were later influenced more significantly by economic and policy conditions. In the future, differentiated land consolidation policy oriented by public involvement should be formulated to improve new frameworks of system implementation, as well as to provide evidence for spatial configuration, district cooperation, policy adjustment, and the systematic improvement of sustainable land consolidation."
"The way forward—moving toward net zero energy standards Energy; Refurbishment; Renovation Net zero energy building standards have been gaining prominence lately as the next performance target for buildings. However, despite the demonstrated benefits of such building performance across triple bottom-line concepts, Australia is yet to formulate a policy toward adopting a net zero energy building standard. Evidence from various scholars suggests that Australia cannot delay the implementation of deep improvements in energy efficiency in the built environment any longer, as issues of energy security, affordability and increasing greenhouse gas emissions have become critical. This chapter reviews recent advances in the high-performance building standards with emphasis on global developments of net zero energy standards and discusses how Australia is positioned in relation to this standard and the ways Australia might move forward to this standard."
"An active site inhibitor induces conformational penalties for ACE2 recognition by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Free Energy; Molecular Mechanics; Ligands The novel RNA virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus II (SARS-CoV-2), is currently the leading cause of mortality in 2020, having led to over 1.6 million deaths and infecting over 75 million people worldwide by December 2020. While vaccination has started and several clinical trials for a number of vaccines are currently underway, there is a pressing need for a cure for those already infected with the virus. Of particular interest in the design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics is the human protein angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) to which this virus adheres before entry into the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 virion binds to cell-surface bound ACE2 via interactions of the spike protein (s-protein) on the viral surface with ACE2. In this paper, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and binding enthalpy calculations to determine the effect that a bound ACE2 active site inhibitor (MLN-4760) would have on the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 s-protein with ACE2. Our analysis indicates that the binding enthalpy could be reduced for s-protein adherence to the active site inhibitor-bound ACE2 protein by as much as 1.48-fold as an upper limit. This weakening of binding strength was observed to be due to the destabilization of the interactions between ACE2 residues Glu-35, Glu-37, Tyr-83, Lys-353, and Arg-393 and the SARS-CoV-2 s-protein receptor binding domain (RBD). The conformational changes were shown to lead to weakening of ACE2 interactions with SARS-CoV-2 s-protein, therefore reducing s-protein binding strength. Further, we observed increased conformational lability of the N-terminal helix and a conformational shift of a significant portion of the ACE2 motifs involved in s-protein binding, which may affect the kinetics of the s-protein binding when the small molecule inhibitor is bound to the ACE2 active site. These observations suggest potential new ways for interfering with the SARS-CoV-2 adhesion by modulating ACE2 conformation through distal active site inhibitor binding."
"Feminist academic organizations: Challenging sexism through collective mobilizing across research, support, and advocacy Feminism; Identity Work; Organization Studies This paper examines the establishment of a feminist academic organization, GENMAC (Gender, Markets, and Consumers; genmac.co), serving gender scholars in business schools and related fields. In so doing, it builds on the emerging literature of feminist academic organizations, as situated within feminist organizational studies (FOS). Through a feminist case study and by assessing the reflections of GENMAC's board members, we tell the story of the emergence of GENMAC and detail the tensions the organization encountered as it formally established itself as a feminist organization within the confines of a business school setting, a patriarchal system, and a neoliberal university paradigm. We build on the FOS literature by considering how our organization counters cultures of heightened individualism and builds collective action to challenge sexism through the nexus of research, support, and advocacy pillars of our organization. We demonstrate how, through these actions, our organization challenges hierarchies of knowledge, prioritizes the care and support needed for the day-to-day survival of gender scholars in business schools, and spotlights and challenges structural inequalities and injustices in the academy."
"Individual tree canopy parameters estimation using uav-based photogrammetric and lidar point clouds in an urban park Lidar; Tree Crown; Canopy Height Estimation of urban tree canopy parameters plays a crucial role in urban forest management. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely used for many applications particularly forestry mapping. UAV-derived images, captured by an onboard camera, provide a means to produce 3D point clouds using photogrammetric mapping. Similarly, small UAV mounted light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can also provide very dense 3D point clouds. While point clouds derived from both photogrammetric and LiDAR sensors can allow the accurate estimation of critical tree canopy parameters, so far a comparison of both techniques is missing. Point clouds derived from these sources vary according to differences in data collection and processing, a detailed comparison of point clouds in terms of accuracy and completeness, in relation to tree canopy parameters using point clouds is necessary. In this research, point clouds produced by UAV-photogrammetry and-LiDAR over an urban park along with the estimated tree canopy parameters are compared, and results are presented. The results show that UAV-photogrammetry and-LiDAR point clouds are highly correlated with R2 of 99.54% and the estimated tree canopy parameters are correlated with R2 of higher than 95%."
"Critical factors for the adoption of e-government in developing countries: Validation of a measurement model Open Government; Transparency; E-Governance The benefits of e-government have attracted many countries across the world to introduce e-government. There is, however, lack of studies in validating a measurement model for evaluating the adoption of e-government in developing countries. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a measurement model for evaluating the adoption of e-government in developing countries from the perspective of citizens. A pre-test, pilot study, reliability test, the convergent validity, the goodness of model fit and the discriminant validity are performed based on the data collected from 478 respondents using a survey instrument distributed in Saudi Arabia to validate a measurement model. This study, furthermore, validates the measurement model through the use of the structural equation modeling. The results reveal that a total of ten constructs with 39-items are valid for investigating the adoption of e-government in developing countries. This survey instrument provides a useful set of refined measures that can be used in similar contexts for investigating the adoption of e-government."
"Effects of binders on electrochemical properties of high capacity silicon composite anodes Lithium-ion Batteries; Electrode; Silicon Monoxide In this study, the effects of four kinds of binders including polyimide (PI), sodium alginate (SA), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) on the electrochemical properties of a high capacity silicon composite anode (SMG@C) were investigated. Phase constitutes and morphologies of the SMG@C anode materials were carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrochemical properties of the SMG@C anode using the four kinds of binders were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed that in the case of using SA as the binder, the discharge capacity reached 1207 mAh/g after 75 cycles at a current density of 100 mA/g, indicating the best cycle stability. Moreover, the discharge capacity can be restored to the initial capacity state during rate-cycle testing; and the impedance was the lowest among the four binders. This paper also analysed the measured electrochemical impedance spectra with the four different binders and revealed their action mechanisms."
"Sulfated Zirconia Catalysts for D-Sorbitol Cascade Cyclodehydration to Isosorbide: Impact of Zirconia Phase Hydrogenolysis; Catalyst; Sorbitol Isosorbide is a widely touted intermediate for the production of biorenewable polymers and plastics, accessible through the aqueous phase cascade conversion of D-sorbitol to isosorbide via 1,4-sorbitan. However, existing routes to isosorbide typically employ mineral acids under forcing conditions, and hence alternative heterogeneously catalyzed processes are highly desirable. Aqueous phase D-sorbitol conversion was therefore investigated over families of sulfated zirconia (SZ) solid acid catalysts, with the effect of employing monoclinic, tetragonal ZrO2, or Zr(OH)4 as the parent support compared. The cascade proceeds via a stepwise dehydration to 1,4-sorbitan and subsequently isosorbide, with the latter favored over stronger acid sites. Monoclinic SZ exhibits superior activity to tetragonal SZ, reflecting a higher acid site density and pyrosulfate formation at lower SO4 2- loadings than over the other supports. Isosorbide selectivity at iso-conversion was proportional to acid site density, but independent of zirconia phase."
"Evaluation of Micro-EDM (μEDM) Characteristics of Conductive Silicon Carbide Using a Coupled Thermo-Structural Process Model Electric Discharge Machining; Wire; Tool Wear In this work, micro-EDM (Î¼EDM) characteristics of conductive SiC have been evaluated using the knowledge of existing coupled thermo-structural model. A simplified thermo-structural model of Î¼EDM process on conductive SiC has been used to simulate the Î¼EDM process on conductive SiC. So far, the studies have used traditional melting and evaporation removal mechanism during EDM simulation which is suitable for metals. In case of ceramics, material removal occurs by various phenomenon such as spalling, melting, evaporation and it depends on Î¼EDM energy and type of ceramic. Thus, we aim here to evaluate the characteristics of a SiC ceramic using the thermo-structural model. To make the model more realistic, Gaussian heat flux distribution has been used and transient study has been performed. The model uses process parameters (voltage, capacitance and time) and material properties as input to predict the transient temperature distribution, crater dimensions, volume of material removed and thermal residual stresses. To simulate the material removal, element death has been performed. The element death is purely based on attainment of certain temperature suitable for material removal irrespective of material removal mechanism. The transient thermal analysis was carried out in heating phase and the structural analysis was carried out in cooling phase. Observatory experiments were performed to add value to the model predictions."
"Slag waste incorporation in high early strength concrete as cement replacement: Environmental impact and influence on hydration & durability attributes Concrete Aggregates; Construction and Demolition Waste; Mechanical Properties This paper investigates the effects of incorporating slag waste (Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag; GGBS) as cement replacement in high early strength concrete. GGBS was used in various replacement ratios and resulting properties of the developed concretes were evaluated. Compressive strength, heat of hydration and shrinkage were determined for evaluating hydration attributes while chloride penetrability and carbonation resistance were investigated for studying the durability-related characteristics of the resulting concretes. The optimum ratio of GGBS as SCM has been determined, in this study, as 30% at which there is merely an average strength decline of 11% while reducing the total carbon dioxide emissions by 30%. Similarly, at this replacement level, the decreased chloride ion penetrability (15%) and higher carbonation resistance (3%) further encourage its use in precast concrete incorporating (HESC). Finally, the beneficial effects of using slag waste in concrete were quantified by determining associated CO2 emissions. It is concluded that slag incorporation in concrete significantly reduces the CO2 emissions, (up to 68%) depending on the cement replacement level, thus promoting green construction and sustainable development."
"An evaluation of the Free Senior High School Policy in Ghana Development Assistance; Aid Effectiveness; Delivery Of Health Care Based on 65 interviews and secondary information, this study evaluated the programme, process and political dimensions of the Ghana Free Senior High School Education (SHS) Policy. The evidence from the data showed that the programme and its political dimensions were emphasised to the neglect of the process dimension. Effectiveness, one of the criteria in the programme dimension, was somewhat stressed. The remaining five criteria, including Equity, efficiency and responsiveness, were ignored. Overall, the political dimension was the most popular focus given that the introduction of the policy itself had been positively welcomed and this served to bolster confidence in the political regime as a whole. Some of the five stages of the process dimension, e.g. agenda setting and formulation, were poorly executed or were skipped, and implementation was fraught with challenges, such as inadequate funding and limited space. Implications in relation to the Multiple Streams Model, policy success/failure theory and the political settlement framework are discussed."
"Australia’s crisis responses during COVID-19: The case of international students Foreign Nurse; Workforce; Health Workers Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global international education sector has been fraught with multiple, intensifying stressors, which have severely affected international studentsâ€™ lives and study. Host government policies on international education can make a critical difference for this vulnerable population during the pandemic. Australiaâ€™s crisis response policies during the pandemic have been closely tracked and vigorously discussed amongst Chinese international students. This study examines how Australiaâ€™s crisis responses addressed the needs of international students during the pandemic, and how these policies impacted Chinese international studentsâ€™ experiences and perceptions of studying in Australia. We collected qualitative data through interviews with Chinese international students, parents and migration agents, virtual ethnography on WeChat, and analysis of Australiaâ€™s policy responses. Our thematic analysis highlights participantsâ€™ experiences and views of Australiaâ€™s crisis responses in the four areas of financing, third-country transit, visas and immigration, and pandemic management. We discuss these findings in relation to the historical context of Australiaâ€™s higher education funding reforms during the 1980s and 1990s."
"Assessment of a micro-grid hybrid wind-diesel-battery alternative energy system applicable for offshore islands Grid; Microgrid; Energy Systems A complete structure of a crossbreed smaller scale matrix wind-diesel elective vitality framework has been exhibited so as to get the outcomes to satisfy the heap solicitation of 78 kWh/d and a zenith load of 7.1 kW for a little system of that particular zone. By fitting utilization of the HOMER reasonable power source programming, the whole improvement technique has been driven with the idea of climatological data. Proliferation results show that the proposed coordination is attentively and naturally viable and that the Net Present Cost (NPC) similarly as CO2 surge is diminished by about 79% and 87% independently consistently diverged from standard power plants. The headway results uncovered that the blend of 11 Wind turbines (10 kW), 4 Diesel Generator (4 kW) and 2 Battery (Surrette 6CS25P) is the most extraordinary cautiously sensible essentialness unit and insignificant cost of imperativeness (COE) is about USD 0.154/kWh and Net Present Cost (NPC) is USD 72, 405. The examination between the investigated half breed vitality framework and customary vitality frameworks has been accounted for appropriately to legitimize the significance of sustainable power source assets everywhere throughout the world. This advanced blend of half breed elective vitality framework will be appropriate for every single other area on the planet with comparative meteorological and natural conditions."
"Growth of rGO nanostructures via facile wick and oil flame synthesis for environmental remediation Water; Hydrophobicity; Aerogels Oil spills into ocean or coastal waters can result in significant damage to the environment via pollution of aquatic ecosystems. Absorbents based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) foams have the capacity to remove minor or major oil spills. However, conventional chemical synthesis of rGO often uses petrochemical precursors, potentially harmful chemicals, and requires special processing conditions that are expensive to maintain. In this work, an alternative cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach suitable for large-scale production of high-quality rGO directly from used cooking sunflower oil is discussed. Thus, produced flaky graphene structures are effective in absorbing used commercial sunflower oil and engine oil, via monolayer physisorption in the case of used sunflower and engine oils facilitated by van der Waals forces, Ï€â€“Ï€ stacking and hydrophobic interactions, Ï€-cation (H+) stacking and radical scavenging activities. From adsorption kinetic models, first-order kinetics provides a better fit for used sunflower oil adsorption (R2 = 0.9919) and second-order kinetics provides a better fit for engine oil adsorption (R2 = 0.9823). From intra-particle diffusion model, R2 for USO is 0.9788 and EO is 0.9851, which indicates that both used sunflower and engine oils adsorption processes follow an intra-particle diffusion mechanism. This study confirms that waste-derived rGO could be used for environmental remediation."
"Reflections on integrated research from community engagement in peatland restoration Indonesia; Swamp Forest; Biomass Burning Community engagement and integrated research are key approaches to solving complex socio-ecological challenges. This paper describes the experience of bringing together a team of natural and social scientists from Australia and Indonesia in the â€˜Gambut Kitaâ€™ (translated as â€˜Our Peatâ€™) project. Gambut Kita aims to produce new knowledge and support efforts to successfully, and equitably, restore Indonesiaâ€™s tropical peatlands and ensure that livelihoods can be maintained on restored (rewetted) landscapes. The paper focuses on experiences of using community engagement for integrated research. It discusses three community engagement approaches used in the projectâ€”resilience, adaptation pathways and transformation approach (RAPTA), participatory rural appraisal (PRA), and community-led analysis and planning (CLAP). It also describes the qualitative analysis of 14 interviews with the project team of lessons learned in community engagement for integrated research. â€˜Criteria for successâ€™ from the literature on international development projects is used to assess progress. The findings highlight the specific complexities of working across countries and cultures. Successful community engagement is not so much about the â€˜toolâ€™ but about the trust, agency, and support to change. The tools do, however, have different strengths. PRA and CLAP can build deep community understanding and relationships. RAPTA has strengths in framing visions and pathways to the future, systems thinking, anticipatory learning, and taking a cross-scale systems view which is required to solve many of the problems manifesting at local or community scales. Similarly, success in integrated research is not just about individuals, but structures (e.g. explicit process) and infrastructure (e.g. access to technology). These findings suggest that integrated research needs special considerations in terms of design, and these relate across scales to individual researchers as well as teams, leaders and organisations. Integrated research projects need careful, inclusive, iterative management with a lot of interaction to learn from each other, build a common vision, achieve clarity of roles, and share emerging findings."
"(η6-Arene) ruthenium(II) complexes with ferrocene-tethered salicylaldimine ligands: Synthesis, characterization and anti-cancer properties 4-Cymene; Antineoplastic Activity; Iridium A series of ruthenium(II) complexes (5a-5f) derived from ferrocenyl salicylaldimine ligands (3a-3f), coordinated in a chelating mode through the deprotonated phenolic oxygen atom and the imine nitrogen, were synthesized and fully characterised. The molecular structures of selected ligands and complexes were also confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The heterobimetallic Ru-Fe complexes 5a-5f were evaluated for their in vitro anti-cancer activity against human liver cancer (HepG2) and human cervical cancer (HeLa) cell lines and showed better activities compared to the ferrocenyl salicylaldimine ligands. Among the heterobimetallic complexes, 5c and 5d showed enhanced cytotoxicity against HeLa cancer cells (IC50 value of 9.34 ÂµM compared to 31.32 ÂµM for cisplatin), and HepG2 cancer cells (IC50 value of 15.74 ÂµM compared to 27.95 ÂµM for cisplatin), respectively. Mechanistic studies indicated compound 5d induced cell cycle arrest in the S phase. Further, compound 5d treatment resulted in increased ROS generation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in HepG2 cells."
"Effectiveness of Case-based Learning: Views of Construction and Real Estate Students Problem-Based Learning; Medical Students; Medical Education Case-based learning (CBL) is a teaching method used in many disciplines of tertiary education. Based on a questionnaire survey and focus group discussions, the perception of the real estate and construction students on CBL in enhancing professional competencies was evaluated. A total of 278 undergraduate students at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University participated in the study. A series of 8 cases related to construction economics and finance were mounted on an electronic platform, which forms the basis of continuous assessment for two undergraduate subjects taken by year-2 and year-3 full-time and part-time students. Results revealed that students perceive CBL as effective in enhancing problem-solving skills, leading to improvement of motivation and promotion of effective group collaboration and fostering self-directed learning. A comparison was then made on the effectiveness of CBL in terms of examination and course work performance between 2013/14 (control group) and the 2014/15 (treatment group) academic years. The results clearly revealed that the introduction of CBL has improved studentsâ€™ performance significantly. However, as this was their first exposure to CBL, students did experience stress and some lack of confidence, increased workload, and uncertainty. Overall, the findings encourage an active CBL pedagogical approach in construction and real estate curricula."
"Marine Protists and Rhodotorula Yeast as Bio-Convertors of Marine Waste into Nutrient-Rich Deposits for Mangrove Ecosystems Schizochytrium; Labyrinthulida; Docosahexaenoic Acid This paper represents a comprehensive study of two new thraustochytrids and a marine Rhodotorula red yeast isolated from Australian coastal waters for their abilities to be a potential renewable feedstock for the nutraceutical, food, fishery and bioenergy industries. Mixotrophic growth of these species was assessed in the presence of different carbon sources: glycerol, glucose, fructose, galactose, xylose, and sucrose, starch, cellulose, malt extract, and potato peels. Up to 14 g DW/L (4.6 gDW/L-day and 2.8 gDW/L-day) of biomass were produced by Aurantiochytrium and Thraustochytrium species, respectively. Thraustochytrids biomass contained up to 33% DW of lipids, rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6, 124 mg/g DW); up to 10.2 mg/gDW of squalene and up to 61 Î¼g/gDW of total carotenoids, composed of astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, echinenone, and Î²-carotene. Along with the accumulation of these added-value chemicals in biomass, thraustochytrid representatives showed the ability to secrete extracellular polysaccharide matrixes containing lipids and proteins. Rhodotorula sp lipids (26% DW) were enriched in palmitic acid (C16:0, 18 mg/gDW) and oleic acid (C18:1, 41 mg/gDW). Carotenoids (87 Î¼g/gDW) were mainly represented by Î²-carotene (up to 54 Î¼g/gDW). Efficient growth on organic and inorganic sources of carbon and nitrogen from natural and anthropogenic wastewater pollutants along with intracellular and extracellular production of valuable nutrients makes the production of valuable chemicals from isolated species economical and sustainable."
"Recycled plastic modified bitumen: Evaluation of VOCs and PAHs from laboratory generated fumes Asphalt; Volatile Organic Compounds; Bituminous Materials A key aspect when investigating the use of recycled plastics in bitumen relates considerably to the issues relating to occupational, health and safety for humans and the environment from a fuming and emissions perspective. This research investigates laboratory-generated fumes in the forms of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) generated from producing polymer modified bitumen using five different types of recycled plastics. A comparative analysis of recycled plastic modified bitumen fumes was conducted based on a series of optimized parameters, including working temperatures (160 Â°C, 180 Â°C and 200 Â°C) and polymer contents (1%, 2%, 4% and 6% by weight of bitumen) against neat bitumen and polymer-modified bitumen. Forty-eight volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and sixteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were quantified using gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (GCâ€“MS). The results from the comparative analysis revealed that the incorporation of recycled plastics could reduce overall emissions from both VOCs and PAHs perspectives. The reduction in emissions can be attributed to the enhancement in thermal stability of the bitumen blend when recycled plastics are added. The reduction rate is heavily dependent on the type and source of recycled plastics used in the blending process. Furthermore, a specific compound concentration analysis of the top-four weighted compounds emitted reveals that the total concentration of emissions can be deceiving as specific compounds can spike when adding recycled plastics in bitumen despite a reduction trend for the overall concentration."
"“They Burn Brightly, But Only for a Short Time”: The Role of Social Workers in Companion Animal Grief and Loss Animal Assisted Therapy; Service Dogs; Animals The humanâ€“animal bond is a relational theory which describes the dynamic between humans and nonhuman animals that satisfies needs in each for companionship and emotional support, framing companion animals as valued family members. Social workers have historically ignored the central role companion animals play in the lives of their clients, adopting an anthropocentric view underpinned by human rights and social justice. However, the need for companion animal-inclusive practice features in recent social work literature. As companion animals are intricately woven into the lives of their guardians, it follows that their inevitable death brings a profound sense of loss and thus an opportunity for social work intervention. The aim of this research was to see if there was a role for social work practitioners to support grieving animal companion guardians. Qualitative thematic analysis was performed on 218 candid online responses to an article on the topic of losing a companion animal, from which four major themes were identified: strength of the bond, anthropocentrically disenfranchised grief, anticipatory grief in the context of euthanasia, and the need for professional support. This analysis demonstrates the strength of the humanâ€“ animal bond, illustrates how the dominant anthropocentric hegemony disenfranchises this variety of grief and loss, describes the experience of anticipatory grief in the context of euthanasia, and identifies the need for professional support. Implications for social work practice are identified, with opportunities for social workers to exchange their anthropocentric approach for a biocentric view, provide support to veterinarians and other professionals, and to work toward challenging the social constructs, which disenfranchise companion animal loss."
"G-CSFR antagonism reduces neutrophilic inflammation during pneumococcal and influenza respiratory infections without compromising clearance Bacterial Proteins; Streptococcus Pneumoniae; Pneumolysin Excessive neutrophilic inflammation can contribute to the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Whilst anti-inflammatory therapies such as corticosteroids are used to treat excessive inflammation, they do not selectively target neutrophils and may compromise antimicrobial or antiviral defences. In this study, neutrophil trafficking was targeted with a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor monoclonal antibody (G-CSFR mAb) during Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 19F) or influenza A virus (IAV, strain HKx31) lung infection in mice. Firstly, we demonstrated that neutrophils are indispensable for the clearance of S. pneumoniae from the airways using an anti-Ly6G monoclonal antibody (1A8 mAb), as the complete inhibition of neutrophil recruitment markedly compromised bacterial clearance. Secondly, we demonstrated that G-CSF transcript lung levels were significantly increased during pneumococcal infection. Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of G-CSFR mAb significantly reduced blood and airway neutrophil numbers by 30â€“60% without affecting bacterial clearance. Total protein levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (marker for oedema) was also significantly reduced. G-CSF transcript levels were also increased during IAV lung infection. G-CSFR mAb treatment significantly reduced neutrophil trafficking into BAL compartment by 60% and reduced blood neutrophil numbers to control levels in IAV-infected mice. Peak lung viral levels at day 3 were not altered by G-CSFR therapy, however there was a significant reduction in the detection of IAV in the lungs at the day 7 post-infection phase. In summary, G-CSFR signalling contributes to neutrophil trafficking in response to two common respiratory pathogens. Blocking G-CSFR reduced neutrophil trafficking and oedema without compromising clearance of two pathogens that can cause pneumonia."
"A focused review on membrane contactors for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) effluents Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling The need for a more sustainable wastewater treatment is more relevant now due to climate change. Production and reuse of methane from anaerobic treatment is one pathway. However, this is defeated by the presence of dissolved methane in the effluent and would be released to the environment, adding to the greenhouse gas emissions. This review paper provided summary and analysis of studies involved in the production of dissolved methane from AnMBR, focusing with actual methane measurement (gas and dissolved) from AnMBR with different types of wastewater. Then more focused discussion and analysis on the use of membrane-based technology or membrane contactors in the recovery of dissolved methane from AnMBR effluent are included, with its development and energy analysis. The dissolved methane removal and recovery rate of membrane contactors can be as high as 96% and 0.05 mol methane/m2/h, respectively, with very low additional energy requirement of 0.01 kWh/m3 for the recovery. Future perspectives presented focus on the long-term evaluation and modelling of membrane contactors and on the membrane modifications to improve the selectivity of membranes to methane and to limit their fouling and wetting, thus making the technology more economical for resource recovery."
"Accounting professionalization, the state, and transnational capitalism: The case of Iran Accounting Profession; Accountants; Professionalization We examine accounting professionalization in Iran to understand state-controlled adaptation of Iran's professional accounting organization in response to transnational pressure. Using a neo-Gramscian theory of hegemony, the study shows that Iran's accounting occupation as an element of civil society was re-constituted through the interplay of shifting state ideology and transnational capitalism over the past five decades. The state's desire to integrate Iran with the global financial system in recent decades drove changes to Iran's accounting professional organization for alignment with transnational norms. The adaptation occurred amidst local resistance to transnational preference for granting regulatory powers to an autonomous professional accounting body. The study highlights professional autonomy as a contested ideational site of struggle in this process. The state preserved standard setting authority within the state apparatus, granted statutory audit and professional certification powers to an ideologically-trusted professional body, and relegated an accounting association construed as espousing neoliberal ideology to the politically less sensitive responsibility of offering professional education. We interpret this regulatory role specialization of the occupational groups as a product of the state's selective co-optation of the groups on ideological grounds. The study highlights the role of a country's ideological distance from neoliberalism in shaping adaptation of regulatory institutions for alignment to transnational norms."
"Digital harassment and abuse: Experiences of sexuality and gender minority adults Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica Digital harassment and abuse refers to a range of harmful, interpersonal behaviours experienced via the internet, as well as via mobile phone and other electronic communication devices. Whereas much existing research has focused on the experiences of children and young people (including foremost â€˜cyberbullyingâ€™), there have been few international studies on adult experiences of digital harassment and abuse. As such, little is currently known about the extent, nature and impacts of digital harassment and abuse on adult victims. In particular, there exists a significant gap in current research into sexual, sexuality and gender based digital harassment and abuse. This article draws on findings from a larger research project in which we surveyed 2956 Australian adults and 2842 British adults (aged 18 to 54) about their experiences of technology-facilitated sexual violence (TFSV). The data presented here focus on the experiences of sexuality diverse adults (n = 282) who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or heterosexual, as well as gender diverse adults (n = 90), including women, men and transgender individuals. Results suggest that transgender individuals experience higher rates of digital harassment and abuse overall, and higher rates of sexual, sexuality and gender based harassment and abuse, as compared with heterosexual cisgender individuals. Implications of the findings are discussed with respect to policy, prevention, and future research."
"Community Learning Centres (CLCs) for Adult Learning and Education (ALE): development in and by communities Adult Literacy; Life Long Learning; Education Institutionalised forms of adult learning and education (ALE) such as community learning centres (CLCs) and related models are found in most parts of the world. These are spaces offering opportunities for literacy and skills training, health and citizenship, general, liberal and vocational education, in line with fuller recognition of the meaning of lifelong learning, and in the context of local communities. Often these institutions form the basis for even more informal and participatory learning, like study circles and community groups. They may share facilities like libraries and museums, clubs and sports centres, which are not within the remit of the Ministry of Education. This article reviews relevant literature and identifies recent studies and experiences with a particular focus on the Asia-Pacific and Africa regions, but also considers insights related to interventions at the global level. Findings point to low levels of participation of adults in general, and more specifically so for vulnerable and excluded groups which can hardly cross respective barriers. The authorsâ€™ discussion is guided by the question What conditions are conducive to having more and better ALE for lifelong learning â€“ and which roles can CLCs and other community-based ALE institutions play? This discussion is timely â€“ the authors argue that CLCs need to be given more attention in international commitments such as those made in the context of the International Conferences of Adult Education (CONFINTEA) and the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). CLCs, they urge, should be part of transformative discourse and recommendations at CONFINTEA VII in 2022."
"Innovative responses to urban transportation: current practice in Australian cities Energy Transition; Innovation System; Sustainability There is extensive theorisation and knowledge of innovation systems internationally; however, the application of this knowledge to urban transport issues is less developed. â€¢ Innovations are occurring in urban transport systems internationally across multiple domains, including technological advances as well as policy and institutional development. â€¢ Recent analysis highlights the role of the state in fostering transport innovations and the institutional context for innovation. â€¢ Passive and active responses to innovations in Australian urban transport systems are uneven and fragmented. â€¢ There are many opportunities for Australia's urban transport policy and the regulatory institutional environment to better respond to innovations, including through greater coordination around agreed national goals, institutional design for innovation, and greater effort to engender cross-sectoral innovation practices."
"‘So, What is a Good Masculinity?’: Navigating Normativity in Violence Prevention with Men and Boys Young; Sex Education; Sexuality Engaging men and boys to address the links between masculinity and gendered violence is a rapidly expanding space for primary prevention, in Australia and globally. There are parallel debates within feminist commentary on violence prevention and in masculinity studies over how to conceptualise and deconstruct masculinity for the long-term transformation of gender inequality. This article analyses semi-structured interviews with Australian prevention practitioners whose work focuses on engaging men and boys, which included initiatives aimed at gender equality, healthy masculinity, preventing violence against women, and domestic/family violence prevention. Interviews highlighted that these practitioners are currently grappling with how to address masculinity as a construct and/or a normative process within their work to achieve gender transformative change. These tensions reflect ongoing concerns over reproducing narrow associations between men and masculinity that perpetuate essentialised identity categories. Importantly, I question whether a focus on â€˜positiveâ€™ or â€˜healthyâ€™ masculinities can effectively go beyond the binary gender relations that underpin gendered violence. The research findings suggest a need for greater reflexive and creative thinking around how men and masculinity are (de)centred within violence prevention to better support gender transformation."
"The effect of enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated wastepaper for bioethanol production Saccharification; Cellulases; Enzymatic Hydrolysis Enzymatic hydrolysis of waste biomass for bioethanol production is considered a decades old traditional, inexpensive, and energy-effective approach. In this study, waste office paper was pretreated with diluted sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrolyzed with one of the most available and cost-effective enzymes, cellulase derived from Trichoderma reesei, under submerged static condition. Three different pretreatment approachesâ€”cut into 2 cm2, blended with distilled water, and pretreated with diluted H2SO4â€”have been implemented, and pretreatment with diluted H2SO4 was the most effective. Hydrolysis with different concentrationsâ€”0.5 M, 1.0 M, 1.5 M, 2.0 M of H2SO4â€”was performed. The maximum glucose content was obtained at 2.0 M H2SO4 at 90 min reaction time, and glucose yield was 0.11 g glucose/g wastepaper. The cut paper, wet-blended, and acid-treated wastepaper was hydrolyzed with cellulase enzyme for 2, 4, and 5 consecutive days with 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg enzyme loadings. The maximum glucose content obtained was 9.75 g/l from acid-treated wastepaper, after 5 days of enzymatic hydrolysis with 20 mg enzyme loading and a glucose yield of a 0.5 g glucose/g wastepaper. The wastepaper hydrolysate was further fermented for 6, 8, and 10 hours continuously with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), and at 10 hours of fermentation, the maximum glucose consumption was 0.18 g by yeast. Further, HPLC analysis of the fermented medium presented a strong peak of bioethanol content at 16.12 min. The distillation of bioethanol by rotary evaporator presented 0.79 ml bioethanol/fermented solution, which indicated the conversion efficiency of 79%."
"Impacts of farmers' adaptation to drought and salinity intrusion on rice yield in Vietnam's Mekong Delta Crops; CERES (Experiment); Climate Change Impact Purpose: The Vietnamese Mekong River Delta (VMD) is one of the most affected deltas by climate change in the world. Several studies have investigated factors influencing farmers' climate change adaptation behaviors in the region; however, little is known about the effectiveness of such measures. This paper examines the determinants of adaptation strategies among VMD rice farmers and assesses the impacts of such practices on rice yield. Design/methodology/approach: Endogenous switching regressions were employed using a survey data of 300 rice-producing households in An Giang and Tra Vinh provinces in 2016. Findings: The results show that farmers receiving early disaster warnings are more likely to adopt adaptation measures to climate change. If nonadaptors had chosen to respond, their rice yield would have increased by 0.932 tons/ha/season. Research limitations/implications: The data sample is small and collected from two provinces in the VMD only; therefore, the results may be specific for the study sites. However, future research can adopt the proposed method for other regions. Originality/value: The study estimates the production impacts of farmers' decisions on whether or not to adapt to extreme climate events. The proposed approach allows for capturing both observed and unobserved behaviors."
Reviewing the purpose of professional experience: A case study in initial teacher education reform Initial Teacher Education; Teacher Identity; Mentoring This paper documents the results of a mixed method study focussing on staff perceptions of professional experience in the Education faculty of an Australian university. The study takes place in a climate of both legislative and organisational change and the outcomes provide insights into viewpoints of both academic and professional staff understanding of priorities and the purposes of professional experience. The study contributes to the contemporary political discourse and rigorous accountability surrounding professional experience and the role of teacher educators as well as offering potential new insights into the complexity of pre-service teacher preparation in contemporary schools and universities.
"Transformer-Based Multi-task Learning for Queuing Time Aware Next POI Recommendation Human Mobility; Taxis; Points Of Interest Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is an important and challenging problem due to different contextual information and wide variety in human mobility patterns. Most of the prior studies incorporated user travel spatiotemporal andsequential patterns to recommend next POIs. However, few of these previous approaches considered the queuing time at POIs and its influence on userâ€™s mobility. The queuing time plays a significant role in affecting user mobility behaviour, e.g., having to queue a long time to enter a POI might reduce visitorâ€™s enjoyment. Recently, attention based recurrent neural networks-based approaches show promising performance in next POI recommendation but they are limited to single head attention which can have difficulty finding the appropriate complex connections between users, previous travel history and POI information. In this research, we present a problem of queuing time aware next POI recommendation and demonstrate how it is non-trivial to both recommend a next POI and simultaneously predict its queuing time. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-task, multi head attention transformer model called TLR-M. The model recommends next POIs to the target users and predicts queuing time to access the POIs simultaneously. By utilizing multi-head attention, the TLR-M model can integrate long range dependencies between any two POI visit efficiently and evaluate their contribution to select next POIs and to predict queuing time. Extensive experiments on eight real datasets show that the proposed model outperforms than the state-of-the-art baseline approaches in terms of precision, recall and F1 score evaluation metrics. The model also predicts and minimizes the queuing time effectively."
"A contemporary view of interpersonal aggression and cyberbullying through ICT: multilevel insights from LMX differentiation Mobbing; Incivility; Nurses Purpose: While the rapid adoption of information communication technologies (ICT) in organizations has been linked with a higher risk of cyberbullying, research on the influence of cyberbullying on interpersonal behaviors in the workplace remains limited. By drawing on the ego-depletion theory and the leader-member exchange (LMX) theory, this research investigates how, why and when workplace cyberbullying may trigger interpersonal aggression through ICT. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected data from 259 employees and 62 supervisors working in large ICT organizations in China through a multi-wave survey. The authors performed multilevel analysis and used hierarchical linear modeling to test the proposed moderated mediation model. Findings: The results revealed that workplace cyberbullying has a significant and positive influence on interpersonal aggression in the workplace via ego depletion. The authors found that differentiation in LMX processes at group level moderates the indirect relationship between workplace cyberbullying and interpersonal aggression (via ego depletion). Furthermore, the positive indirect effect of workplace cyberbullying was found to be stronger in the presence of a high LMX differentiation condition in comparison to a low LMX differentiation condition. Research limitations/implications: The data were collected from Chinese ICT organizations, which may limit the generalization of this studyâ€™s findings to other cultural and sectoral contexts. Originality/value: This paper provides the first step in understanding how, why and when workplace cyberbullying triggers interpersonal aggression by investigating the role of ego depletion as a mediator and LMX differentiation as a boundary condition. This is the first study to empirically examine the relationships between workplace cyberbullying, ego depletion, LMX differentiation and interpersonal aggression in ICT organizations using multi-level modeling."
"A complementary approach of response surface methodology and an artificial neural network for the optimization and prediction of low salinity reverse osmosis performance Reverse Osmosis; Desalination; Sea Water The treatment of saline water sources by reverse osmosis (RO) is being utilized increasingly to address water shortages around the world. The application of RO is energy-intensive; therefore, plant and process optimization are crucial. The desalination of low salinity water sources with total dissolved solids (TDS) of <5000 mg/L is less energy intensive than the desalination of highly saline seawater and brackish water. A gap exists in optimization studies on lower salinity water (TDS = 500â€“5000 mg/L). The novelty of the study is the development of a complementary approach using response surface methodology (RSM) and an artificial neural network (ANN) for performance modelling, optimization, and prediction of RO desalination of low salinity water. Feed water salinity, pressure, and temperature were controlled variables to model the performance of the RO system. A performance index incorporating salt rejection efficiency and permeate flux was used as the response target of the system. The optimal parameter combination within their modelled range for the best performance index occurred near the highest pressure input of 150.57 psi, at the temperature of 38.8 Â°C, and at the lowest feed salt concentration of 577 mg/L. Both the RSM and ANN models demonstrated high validity. The RSM and ANN showed R2 values of 0.99 each and with a root mean square error of 2.41 and 5.85 respectively. The RSM showed a small benefit in model accuracy over the ANN, but the ANN has the benefit of not requiring the central composite design before experimentation and being a continuously improving prediction method as more data becomes available. Further applications of the optimization and modelling approach can be applied to RO system optimization considering membrane types and additional feedwater characteristics."
"Outdoor thermal comfort of urban park-A case study Thermal Comfort; Hot Temperature; Microclimate Urban parks are an important component of urban public green space and a public place where a large number of urban residents choose to conduct outdoor activities. An important factor attracting people to visit and stay in urban parks is its outdoor thermal comfort, which is also an important criterion for evaluating the liability of the urban environment. In this study, through field meteorological monitoring and a questionnaire survey, outdoor thermal comfort of different types of landscape space in urban parks in Chengdu, China was studied in winter and summer. Result indicated that (1) different types of landscape spaces have different thermal comforts, (2) air temperature is the most important factor affecting outdoor thermal comfort; (3) because the thermal sensation judgment of outdoor thermal comfort research in Chengdu area, an ASHRAE seven-sites scale can be used; (4) the neutral temperature ranges of Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) in Chengdu in winter and summer were obtained through research; (5) and UTCI is the best index for evaluating outdoor thermal comfort in Chengdu. These findings provide theoretical benchmarks and technical references for urban planners and landscape designers to optimize outdoor thermal comfort in urban areas to establish a more comfortable and healthy living environment for urban residents."
"Persistent organic pollutant (POPs) concentrations from great-winged petrels nesting in Western Australia Feathers; Birds; Grus Japonensis Marine animals that traverse coastal and offshore environments are potentially exposed to multiple sources of pollution. Baseline data of pollutant concentrations of these fauna are needed in remote areas as human populations grow and economic development increases because changes may affect local wildlife in unforeseen ways. Persistent organic pollutant (POPs) concentrations were quantified in an understudied seabird, the great-winged petrel (Pterodroma macroptera), that breeds in southern Western Australia. Organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) were measured in adults. Total POPs concentrations ranged 5.6â€“46.4 ng gâˆ’1 ww. The most frequently detected POPs were the dichlorodiethyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolite 4,4'DDE, the PCB CB-28, and the BFR polybrominated diphenyl ether BDE-99. These results contribute to the limited POPs data in marine fauna in this remote region, and the Southern Hemisphere, adding to the growing body of evidence that remote regions are affected by global trends of POPs distributions."
"Polyurethanes from seed oil-based polyols: A review of synthesis, mechanical and thermal properties Epoxidized Soybean Oil; Tung Oil; Vegetable Oil Polyurethanes (PUs) are multipurpose polymers that are increasingly used in many industrial fields. The main compounds used to synthesize PUs are still derived from petrochemicals. The last decade has witnessed an upsurge of research and technological innovations in developing PUs, especially the polyol component from bio-based resources. These efforts are primarily driven by uncertainty surrounding the crude oil reserves and environmental pollution. Among the bio-derived resources, seed oils are the most promising and intensely investigated raw materials in the PU industry due to their abundance, inherent biodegradability, and low price. There are numerous strategies to chemically functionalize the structure of seed oils by introducing hydroxyl groups and convert them into reactive polyols for PU synthesis. The seed oil-based polyols with different structures and functions enable synthesis of industrial PUs with mechanical and thermal characteristics comparable to those of petrochemical-based PUs. Herein we systematically review the literature on synthesis of PUs using polyols derived from seed oils with special focus on their mechanical performance and thermal properties. Given the potential of seed oil-based PUs in many industrial applications, we expect that they will attract increasing commercial interest and scientific research to bring these materials to the market in the near future."
"Survey of Long-tailed macaque's Behaviour in Mount Rinjani National Park, Lombok Timur Pan Troglodytes; Primates; Grooming The research was conducted in Mount Rinjani National Park, Lombok Timur, to observe the daily activities of Long-tailed macaque in utilizing their habitat and vocalization analysis as a hallmark of species. The Long-tailed macaque' activities were analyzed using the scan sampling method. Ten (10) individuals of Long-tailed macaque were observed. The results showed that the observed activities of Long-tailed macaque were feeding, sleeping, inactive, grooming, mating, moving, excretion, playing, making sound, and agonistic (fighting). The average percentage of Long-tailed macaque observed was feeding (10.1%), sleeping (9%), inactive (9.4%), grooming (14.9%), mating (8.5%), moving (11.1%), excretion (7.9%), playing (9.7%), making sound (9.5%), and agonistic (9.9%). The daily activities can be as a reference in detecting the 'species' of the Long-tailed macaque. To support the population of this species, especially for long-term survival, the manager of the Rinjani Nasional Park should preserve the forest with conservation of natural forests and wildlife or biodiversity conservation and ecotourism, also prevent littering and illegal activities."
"Spatiotemporal variations of DOM components in the Kushiro River impacted by a wetland Fluorescence; Parallel Factor Analysis; Aromaticity Dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been recognized as a serious water quality problem in natural water bodies receiving pollution loads from point and nonpoint sources. The present study investigates the spatiotemporal variability of DOM composition in the Kushiro River and its tributaries (Eastern Hokkaido, Japan) impacted by the Kushiro wetland. Water samples were collected in the wet and dry seasons from several locations of the river and analyzed for DOM characteristics by UVâ€“visible and excitationâ€“emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy techniques and by developing water quality index. Rather than the spatial effect, significant seasonal impacts on DOM pollution in the Kushiro River were observed. Overall concentrations of DOM decreased during the dry season. The increase of specific ultraviolet absorbance in the dry season indicated an increasing trend of humification, aromaticity and molecular weight of DOM. Five fluorescent peaks, including peaks A, C, M, B, and T were predicted by EEM spectra. Peaks A and C were found to be the most dominating peaks in both the seasons and indicated enrichment of humic-like matters in river water. The intensities of poly-aromatic humic substances as well as DOM components of microbial origin increase in the wet season and proteins like autochthonous DOM increase during the dry season. The study recognized the contribution of freshly produced DOM component by the decomposition of wetland plants in wet season and effect of snowfall in the dry season. Analysis of three fluorescence indices revealed that the river water primarily contains terrestrially dominated DOM. A significant impact of the adjacent WWTPs and wetland to the river water DOM were also observed. The water quality index of river water DOM showed low to medium levels of DOM pollution in the Kushiro River."
"A Trustworthy Privacy Preserving Framework for Machine Learning in Industrial IoT Systems Privacy Preserving; Randomized Response; Differential Privacy Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is revolutionizing many leading industries such as energy, agriculture, mining, transportation, and healthcare. IIoT is a major driving force for Industry 4.0, which heavily utilizes machine learning (ML) to capitalize on the massive interconnection and large volumes of IIoT data. However, ML models that are trained on sensitive data tend to leak privacy to adversarial attacks, limiting its full potential in Industry 4.0. This article introduces a framework named PriModChain that enforces privacy and trustworthiness on IIoT data by amalgamating differential privacy, federated ML, Ethereum blockchain, and smart contracts. The feasibility of PriModChain in terms of privacy, security, reliability, safety, and resilience is evaluated using simulations developed in Python with socket programming on a general-purpose computer. We used Ganache_v2.0.1 local test network for the local experiments and Kovan test network for the public blockchain testing. We verify the proposed security protocol using Scyther_v1.1.3 protocol verifier."
"Using the capability approach to evaluate energy vulnerability policies and initiatives in Victoria, Australia Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort Energy vulnerability is a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-specific phenomenon that poses a challenge for equity in energy transition policies. The Capability Approach (CA) is a normative framework focused on peopleâ€™s opportunities and freedoms, used to address dimensions of social justice. Whereas the CA has been used to assess and measure conditions of poverty, exclusion and inequality, its application to evaluate policies is rare. Building on work that establishes being able to heat the home adequately as a secondary capability towards being able to lead a healthy life, this narrative review maps the conditions and processes that shape this secondary capability in Victoria, Australia. It also evaluates local policies and initiatives aimed at addressing energy vulnerability. The map identifies structural, geographical and cultural phenomena and feed-back loops and exposes a hierarchy of capabilities for vulnerable households that need to be satisfied. The policy review finds that current efforts focus on mitigating inequalities in resources with little evidence for outcomes in security or transformative agency. Future initiatives may give more attention to the satisfaction of the tertiary capability of being able to live in an energy efficient dwelling, customise solutions to the multitude and range of conditions and acknowledge the need of warmth throughout the home."
"Making ecologies on private land: Conservation practice in rural-amenity landscapes Payments For Ecosystem Services; Payment; China This book explores conservation practices on private land, based on research conducted with landholders in the hinterlands of Melbourne, Australia. It examines how conservation is pursued as an intimate interaction between people and ecologies, suggesting that local ecologies are lively participants in this process, rather than simply the object of conservation, and that landholders develop their ideas of environmental stewardship through this interaction. The book also explores the consequences of private property as a form of spatial organisation for conservation practice; the role of formative interactions with ecologies in producing durable experiential knowledge; how the possibilities for contemporary conservation practice are shaped by historical landscape modification; and how landholders engage with conservation covenants and payment schemes as part of their conservation practice. The authors conclude with ideas on how goals and approaches to private land conservation might be reframed amid calls for just social and ecological outcomes in an era of rapid environmental change."
"Vernacular human security and moris diak in timor-leste: A social contract between the living and spirit actants Timor-Leste; Post-Independence; Peacebuilding The concept of human security argues that the improvement of peopleâ€™s wellbeing and livelihoods is a vital component in the stability of the state. What happens, however, when the state is not viewed as the only (if at all) source of influence on peopleâ€™s everyday security? This article argues for a particular vernacular of human security that recognizes a social contract between the living with spirit actants, in ways that can often compete with or challenge state-building efforts. In Timor-Leste, ancestral spirits (matebian sira) can directly intervene in the physical safety of their living descendants, and livelihoods (in terms of food security) often depends on engagement between the living and their ancestors as well as nature spirits (rai-nain-sira)."
"Non-invasive fluorescent monitoring of ovarian cancer in an immunocompetent mouse model Ovarian Neoplasms; Fallopian Tubes; Carcinoma In Situ Ovarian cancers (OCs) are the most lethal gynaecological malignancy, with high levels of relapse and acquired chemo-resistance. Whilst the tumour&#x96;immune nexus controls both cancer progression and regression, the lack of an appropriate system to accurately model tumour stage and immune status has hampered the validation of clinically relevant immunotherapies and therapeutic vaccines to date. To address this need, we stably integrated the near-infrared phytochrome iRFP720 at the ROSA26 genomic locus of ID8 mouse OC cells. Intrabursal ovarian implantation into C57BL/6 mice, followed by regular, non-invasive fluorescence imaging, permitted the direct visualization of tumour mass and distribution over the course of progression. Four distinct phases of tumour growth and dissemination were detectable over time that closely mimicked clinical OC progression. Progression-related changes in immune cells also paralleled typical immune profiles observed in human OCs. Specifically, we observed changes in both the CD8+ T cell effector (Teff):regulatory (Treg) ratio, as well as the dendritic cell (DC)-to-myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) ratio over time across multiple immune cell compartments and in peritoneal ascites. Importantly, iRFP720 expression had no detectible influence over immune profiles. This new model permits non-invasive, longitudinal tumour monitoring whilst preserving host&#x96;tumour immune interactions, and allows for the pre-clinical assessment of immune profiles throughout disease progression as well as the direct visualization of therapeutic responses. This simple fluorescence-based approach provides a useful new tool for the validation of novel immuno-therapeutics against OC."
"Linking high-performance work systems to affective commitment, job satisfaction, and career satisfaction: Thriving as a mediator and wasta as a moderator High Performance Work Systems; Personnel; HR Practice This study examines how high-performance work systems (HPWSs) are related to Saudi employeesâ€™ work and career outcomes. Drawing on the socially embedded model of thriving, we propose a model that includes the mediating role of thriving at work and the moderating role played by wasta in the relationship between HPWS and the employee outcomes of affective commitment, job satisfaction, and career satisfaction. To test the conceptual model, we collected data from 187 healthcare workers across Saudi Arabian hospitals at three time points. Our findings reveal that HPWSs positively affect employeesâ€™ thriving at work, which in turn enhances their work and career outcomes. Our study also demonstrates that wasta is a boundary condition that buffers the strength of the effect of HPWSs on thriving and the indirect effects of HPWSs on employeesâ€™ work and career outcomes via thriving. This study extends current theoretical knowledge of how and when HPWSs can exert a more positive influence on employee outcomes. In practice, these findings will inform managers of better approaches to leveraging HPWSs and individual cultural values to enhance employee outcomes."
"Global projection of lead-zinc supply from known resources Material Flow Analysis; Strategic Materials; Metals Lead and zinc are used extensively in the construction and automotive industries, and require sustainable supply. In order to understand the future availability of lead and zinc, we have projected global supplies on a country-by-country basis from a detailed global assessment of mineral resources for 2013. The model GeRS-DeMo was used to create projections of lead and zinc production from ores, as well as recycling for lead. Our modelling suggests that lead and zinc production from known resources is set to peak within 15 years (lead 2025, zinc 2031). For lead, the total supply declines relatively slowly post peak due to recycling. If additional resources are found, these peaks would shift further into the future. These results suggest that lead and zinc consumers will need to plan for the future, potentially by: seeking alternative supplies (e.g., mine tailings, smelter/refinery slags); obtaining additional value from critical metals contained in lead-zinc ore deposits to counter lower grade ores; identifying potential substitutes; redesigning their products; or by contributing to the development of recycling industries."
"Co3O4 needles on Au honeycomb as a non-invasive electrochemical biosensor for glucose in saliva Sensing; Chronoamperometry; Electrooxidation While glucose monitoring technology is widely available, the continued prevalence of diabetes around the world coupled with its debilitating effects continues to grow. The significant limitations which exist in the current technology, instils the need for materials capable of non-invasive glucose detection. In this study a unique non-enzymatic electrochemical glucose sensor was developed, utilising a gold honeycomb-like framework upon which sharp Co3O4 needles are anchored. This composite nanomaterial demonstrates excellent sensing performance in glucose concentrations ranging between 20 Î¼M and 4 mM, exceeding the range required for non-invasive glucose sensing. In conjunction with this high sensitivity (2.014 mA mMâˆ’1Â·cmâˆ’2), the material possesses excellent selectivity towards glucose for commonly interfering physiological species such as uric acid and ascorbic acid. Glucose detection in synthetic saliva was then performed showing excellent capability in the low concentration range (20 Î¼Mâ€“1 mM) for non-invasive sensing performance. Further tests showed good selectivity of the sensor in physiological contaminants commonly found in saliva such as cortisol and dopamine. This development provides excellent scope to create next-generation non-invasive diabetes monitoring platforms, with excellent performance when detecting low glucose concentrations in complex solutions such as saliva."
"To eat in peace, share well: A vision of a relational peace from the democratic republic of congo African Philosophy; Ubuntu; Communitarian The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is well known for incidences of violence, human rights violations and injustices. Indeed, ever since its formation as the Congo Free State (1885 to 1908) under King Leopold II of Belgium, the Congo has been imagined as a site of savagery, barbarity and extreme violence, embodying the primal heart of the dark continent of Africa (Dunn 2003). It is less well known that here, like elsewhere throughout Africa, a rich tradition of BÃºmÃ¹ntÃ¹ (authentic Personhood) endures - calling individuals and communities towards a relational peace (of social harmony alongside human dignity for all). Drawing from dialogues conducted in Kamina, the Haut-Lomami Province, this article explores a vision of peace arising from such a tradition. It asks the question - what might the struggle for peace look like if the challenge is understood not as a negative one of ending an ""inherent""violence, but instead as a positive one of extending an existing peace?."
"Trace metal biomonitoring in the east Gippsland Lakes estuary using the barnacle Amphibalanus variegatus and mussel Mytilus edulis Assimilation Efficiency; Bioaccumulation; Cadmium The Gippsland Lakes estuary, a Ramsar listed wetland, in Victoria, Australia, is an area of potential concern for metal pollution due to influxes of human population and associated anthropogenic activities. A biomonitoring exercise was undertaken where the concentrations of 9 metals (Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Ag, Cd and Hg) were analysed in the soft tissue of two common sessile invertebrates: the mussel Mytilus edulis and the barnacle Amphibalanus variegatus from 6 locations on two different occasions throughout the Gippsland Lakes estuary. A salinity gradient exists in the Lakes, from seawater at Lakes Entrance in the east, decreasing down to < 10 PSU in the west at Lake Wellington during times of rainfall, which is a major factor governing the growth and distribution of both species. Dissolved metal levels in general were low; however, Cu at most sites exceeded the 90% trigger values, while all Zn concentrations exceeded the lowest 80% trigger values of the ANZECC marine water quality guidelines for environmental health. Elevated levels of Cu and Zn were found particularly in barnacles at some sites with environmental contamination due to leaching from anti fouling paints and sacrificial zinc anodes. Elevated levels of Ag and Cd were found in mussels at the Hollands Landing site, which is immediately adjacent to a boat ramp, and Cd and Ag at this site are suspected to originate from inland anthropogenic sources. Concentrations of As in M. edulis across all 6 sites in both sampling periods had mean wet weight As concentrations exceeding the maximum level stated in the FSANZ guidelines. A. variegatus contained elevated levels of Hg especially at the North Arm site with a maximum of 13.6 Î¼g Hg/g dry wt., while A. variegatus also showed temporal changes in Hg concentrations across sites. The maximum Hg concentration found in Mytilus edulis was 1.49 Î¼g Hg/g dry wt. at the Hollands Landing site. Previous contaminant studies of biota in the Lakes have targeted sampling of singular predatory or migratory species, such as Black Bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) and the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis). This is the first biomonitoring study conducted on sessile organisms to assess metal contamination in the system."
"‘You’re actually the problem’: manifestations of populist masculinist anxieties in Australian higher education Student Evaluation of Teaching; Course Evaluation; University Teacher In 2016 the world witnessed a consolidation of a western brand of political â€˜populist authoritarianismâ€™ that is anti-globalisationalist and creates â€˜shared objects of loathingâ€™ in the popular imagination. This article engages with the implications of this affective and masculinist â€˜post-truthâ€™ era for higher education and analyses the narratives of teacher educators who teach compulsory classes based on inclusion and diversity. The article uses the work of feminist, Indigenous and queer theorists to explore gendered responses to pedagogical encounters recounted in the data. We offer a reading of these experiences that links white male objections, particularly around the teaching of gender and race, to the growth of neoconservatism that precipitated the contemporary rise of populist authoritarianism. The pedagogical encounters we explore reflect the notion that the Australian white male is a figure who is brought undone by allowing the subaltern to speak."
"Neither Hope nor Fear: Empirical Evidence Should Drive Biodiversity Conservation Strategies Botany; Biology Teacher; Animals In biodiversity conservation, the prevailing consensus is that optimistic messages should be used to inspire people to change their behaviour, but there is scarce empirical evidence that optimistic messages lead to favourable conservation behaviour change."
"Latest advancements on livestock waste management and biogas production: Bangladesh's perspective Anaerobic Digestion; Biofuel; Methane Production Large quantity of animal waste production in Bangladesh has spurred the demand of potential applications for waste management. Therefore, biofuel production from animal waste has been projected as the solution for animal waste management along with the potential of a new source of renewable energy. This study aimed to evaluate the production of biogas from the farm wastes in Bangladesh and presented the potential biological applications for processing the wastes to convert into biogas. The study demonstrated that the highest amount of livestock waste, approximately 229 million ton was produced in 2016 and it was accounted for a total biogas production potential of 16988.97 million m3 which could be converted into 16.68 Ã— 107 MWh of electricity. This study also presented the suitable conversion technologies as well as mechanisms of biogas production from animal waste and related mathematical equations to calculate the amount of total biogas productions. The latest advancements in large scale biogas production via government and non-government organizations have also been documented in this work. Besides biogas production analysis, this study also demonstrated the environmental impacts of biogas application. A net CO2 emission reduction of 4.42 million tons could have been achieved over the diesel power generation along with 29 million ton of biofertilizer. The study also proposed a management plan to improve the current waste removal situation in Bangladesh. Along with that, this review comprehensively outlined the worldwide scenario of biogas production and applications."
"Weighted inter-rater agreement measures for ordinal outcomes Raters; Interrater Reliability; Cohen's Kappa Estimation of the degree of agreement between different raters is of crucial importance in medical and social sciences. There are lots of different approaches proposed in the literature for this aim. In this article, we focus on the inter-rater agreement measures for the ordinal variables. The ordinal nature of the variable makes this estimation task more complicated. Although there are modified versions of inter-rater agreement measures for ordinal tables, there is no clear agreement on the use of a particular approach. We conduct an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate and compare the accuracy of mainstream inter-rater agreement measures for ordinal tables with each other and figure out the effect of different table structures on the accuracy of these measures. Our results are useful in the sense that they provide detailed information about which measure to use with different table structures to get most reliable inferences about the degree of agreement between two raters. With our simulation study, we recommend use of Gwetâ€™s AC2 and Brennan-Predigerâ€™s Îº in the situation where there is high agreement among raters. However, it should be noted that these coefficients overstate the extent of agreement among raters when there is no agreement, and the data is unbalanced."
"A 30 kDa polyethylene glycol-enfuvirtide complex enhances the exposure of enfuvirtide in lymphatic viral reservoirs in rats Enfuvirtide; Human Immunodeficiency Virus Fusion Inhibitor; Inhibitor HIV therapy with anti-retroviral drugs is limited by the poor exposure of viral reservoirs, such as lymphoid tissue, to these small molecule drugs. We therefore investigated the effect of PEGylation on the anti-retroviral activity and subcutaneous lymphatic pharmacokinetics of the peptide-based fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide in thoracic lymph duct cannulated rats. Both the peptide and the PEG were quantified in plasma and lymph via ELISA. Conjugation to a single 5 kDa linear PEG decreased anti-HIV activity three-fold compared to enfuvirtide. Whilst plasma and lymphatic exposure to peptide mass was moderately increased, the loss of anti-viral activity led to an overall decrease in exposure to enfuvirtide activity. A 20 kDa 4-arm branched PEG conjugated with an average of two enfuvirtide peptides decreased peptide activity by six-fold. Plasma and lymph exposure to enfuvirtide, however, increased significantly such that anti-viral activity was increased two- and six-fold respectively. The results suggest that a multi-enfuvirtide-PEG complex may optimally enhance the anti-retroviral activity of the peptide in plasma and lymph."
"The paradox of accounting for cultural heritage: a longitudinal study on the financial reporting of heritage assets of major Australian public cultural institutions (1992–2019) Accrual Accounting; International Public Sector Accounting Standards; Local Government Purpose: The monetary valuation of cultural heritage of a selection of 16 major public, not-for-profit Australian cultural institutions is examined over a period of almost three decades (1992â€“2019) to understand how they have responded to the paradoxical tensions of heritage valuation for financial reporting purposes. Design/methodology/approach: Accounting for cultural heritage is an intrinsically paradoxical practice; it involves a conflict of two opposite ways of attributing value: the traditional accounting and the heritage professionals (or curatorial) approaches. In analysing the annual reports and other documentary sources through qualitative content analysis, the study explores how different actors responded to the conceptual and technical contradictions posed by the monetary valuation of â€œheritage assetsâ€, the accounting phraseology of accounting standards. Findings: Four phases emerge from the analysis undertaken of the empirical material, each characterised by a distinctive nature of the paradox, the institutional responses discerned and the outcomes. Although a persisting heterogeneity in the practice of accounting for cultural heritage is evident, responses by cultural institutions are shown to have minimised, so far, the negative impacts of monetary valuation in terms of commercialisation of deaccessioning decisions and distorted accountability. Originality/value: In applying the theoretical lens of paradox theory in the context of the financial reporting of heritage, as assets, the study enhances an understanding of the challenges and responses by major public cultural institutions in a country that has led this development globally, providing insights to accounting standard setters arising from the accounting practices observed."
"Special WSMC edition paper: What is this thing called money? Economic abuse in young adult relationships Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Economics of Scale Purpose: This paper aims to investigate how economic abuse manifests in young adult relationships from the perspective of practice experts to inform the role of social marketing in economic abuse prevention. Practitioners were asked for their views on prevention strategies at the individual, relationship, community and societal levels. Design methodology/approach: Twenty-four experts were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Findings: Experts reported that young adults experienced economic exploitation, adverse economic entanglement and economic control. Young adultsâ€™ frame of reference was a challenge for practitioners. Experts believed that more work needed to be done to improve the financial literacy of young adults. Research limitations/implications: Practitioner views provide one side of the story. A separate study has been established interviewing young adults to explore these issues further. Practical implications: The authors argue that prevention and intervention strategies need to focus on young adults who are in their critical relationship formation stage. The identified attitudinal factors present a challenge to policy, prevention and service providers. Originality/value: The authors shift the attention from service engaged women leaving violent relationships to young adults who have not sought assistance from community or domestic violence services. In doing so, they highlight the importance of the relationship formation phase. This paper raises the challenge for social marketers to consider appropriate prevention and intervention programmes for this cohort. Current and future campaigns and programmes need to be designed and evaluated with an economic abuse lens."
"Generic integration of VR and AR in product lifecycles based on CAD models Digital Factory; Product Life Cycle; Manufacturing Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) play an important role for the implementation of Industry 4.0 - especially in the area of virtual prototyping, manufacturing and maintenance. Thus, a holistic integration of these technologies in existing processes structures is essential to ensure future competitiveness of companies. Current research mostly focuses on some aspects of the lifecycle and not on the whole process. Furthermore, mostly specific tools are developed to create AR and VR contents instead of using already existing and widespread programs for example the 3D CAD software Inventor [1] or game engines like Unity [2]. The tools are used to create VR content providing a user-friendly environment with limited options for content creation. On one side the use of these programs decreases the required knowledge to create Mixed Reality applications, however they are associated with high implementation and running costs. This increases the entry barrier for small and medium sized enterprises (SME) to adopt AR and VR into their value chains significantly. The presented work discusses concepts and proposes information models for adding VR-specific information directly in CAD environments. A generic model of necessary interaction options as well as VR properties is created and applied to a use case in the Industry 4.0 model factory at FH Aachen, Germany. Furthermore, a workflow for combined evaluation of product and equipment developments is developed focusing on VR integration."
"A Multi-Agent Platform to Explore Strategies for Age-Friendly Community Projects in Urban China Healthy Aging; Social Inclusion; Automatic Frequency Control Background and Objectives: Although numerous efforts have been made to promote age-friendly communities (AFCs) in urban China, challenges such as the engagement and management of stakeholders, budget constraints, and policy issues remain. This article describes the work of designing a multi-agent platform (MAP) for the briefing stage of AFC projects. Research Design and Methods: The process to design the MAP is first described, and the components and variables are identified. Then, a case study of a stakeholder consensus formation process is conducted using an agent-based simulation. Next, according to the simulation results, strategies to handle the conflicts arising among the stakeholders of AFC projects are proposed. Results: According to the agent-based simulation conducted, both the initial approval rate and the outside connection rate will affect the stakeholder consensus formation process. Although a higher initial approval rate and a lower outside connection rate may reduce the average convergence time, the results show that 3-5 rounds of information exchange are still needed before a consensus or dissent is formed. Discussion and Implications: Investors are suggested to communicate with residents and alleviate their concerns regarding AFC projects to facilitate the consensus formation process during the briefing stage of AFC projects; they can also organize activities for residents to exchange information and ideas. The simulation conducted, together with the MAP built in this research, will serve as a reference to help researchers and practitioners further understand the briefing stage and explore efficient strategies for the successful implementation of AFC projects in urban China."

"Accounting graduate readiness for work: a case study of South East Asia Accounting Education; Accountants; Competency Purpose: This paper compares and contrasts graduate accountant skills and employers' expectations in South East Asia (SEA). Design/methodology/approach: We analyse the employers' expectation performance gap (EPG) in three countries â€“ Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam â€“ to provide a reflection on current professional accounting development in SEA. The study relies on data derived from multiple sources including job advertisements, CIMA â€œready for businessâ€ project, Glassdoor website and other secondary data sources. Findings: The findings indicate that over recent decades, the changing nature of the economy, state, and interest of the business sector (including the â€œBig Fourâ€) have led to the wider adoption of professional accountancy qualifications. The findings suggest that graduates should be equipped with active learning activities such as project-based and work-integrated training to fill the expectation gaps between local university educators and employers. Research limitations/implications: Drawing upon a literature review of professional accounting education, we use the results of the documentations and secondary analysis to describe the performance expectation gap of accounting education in SEA. Originality/value: The study indicates a large discrepancy between the teachings in accounting education and employer requirements in Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia and propose different methods to fill this employability gap in South East Asia."
"Graduate employability: Beyond the skills agenda Employability; Competency; Soft Skills Employability is high on the university agenda worldwide and the dominant discourse of enhancing graduate employability (GE) in higher education focuses on the skills agenda. This chapter challenges the accepted link between the skills agenda and GE. It forwards the message that the process of enhancing GE should go beyond the instrumental approach of equipping students with the knowledge and skills employers require. Rather, the student employment trajectory is complex, and higher education or the first employment is just the beginning of that trajectory. Universities should not only help their students develop their knowledge and skills, but also draw student awareness to the outside societal and labour market conditions and find ways to help students better prepare to be more flexible and adaptable to the local and international working environment. It is also time for a more meaningful dialogue among related stakeholders to identify collaborated roles and responsibilities of each party in the process of enhancing GE."
"Aerobic biodegradation of starch–polyurethane flexible films under soil burial condition: Changes in physical structure and chemical composition Polyurethan; Biodegradation; Ester This paper documents the biodegradation behaviour of flexible films produced by physically blended and chemically grafted starchâ€“polyurethane (PU) hybrid materials. Conversion of carbon content into carbon dioxide was measured after 180 days under soil burial condition. Changes in physical structure and chemical composition brought about by the biodegradation were measured using microscopic and spectroscopic methods. The results suggested that the starch component of the hybrid films provided sites for microorganisms to colonise and biodegrade. Films produced from physically blended starchâ€“PU materials had faster biodegradation (72.5%, 180 days) compared with films produced using chemically grafted starchâ€“PU (26.7, 180 days). The biodegradation of starch-only films was 86% under identical condition. Degradation of starch in films produced from physically blended starchâ€“PU occurred first followed by degradation of polyester soft segments of PU. The slow degradation of films produced from chemically grafted starchâ€“PU hybrids was due to covalently bonded structure. These starchâ€“PU films had a sequentially progressing four-stage biodegradation process: (i) moisture uptake from environment and attachment of microorganisms, (ii) hydrolysis of the starch component, (iii) break down of the chemical structure into small molecular units, and (iv) degradation of the polyurethane component at a slower rate. This study demonstrates that the films produced from physically blended starch-PU hybrid materials have a potential as biodegradable flexible packaging."

In 2016, Australia developed a National Cyber Security strategy and as such is considered to have one of the highest levels of cyber security maturity in the Asia Pacific region. An analysis of the national Cyber Security strategy of Australia will be assessed using the ENISA (European Union (EU) Agency for Network and Information Security) evaluation framework for Cyber Security Strategies and in doing so the strengths and weaknesses will be highlighted to inform policy development and debate."
"A comparison of environmental impacts between rainwater harvesting and rain garden scenarios Bioretention Areas; Stormwater Management; Green Infrastructure Rain garden (RG) is a simple alternative to reduce pollutant loads carried through runoff. However, RG construction impacts the environment, where it demands evidence of net benefits generated once commissioned for operation. This study has simulated the reduction of runoff and pollutant loads due to the installation of RGs. Consequently, the reduction of the impacts on the environment was estimated using the LCA method. A comparison was carried out between the scenarios with and without RG with the most feasible (environmentally) rainwater harvesting (RWH) system. Three RG sizes are considered, such as 3, 4, and 6 m2 in dry, average, and wet annual rainfall conditions. The catchment-scale results showed that the runoff generation impacts of the RGs' operation phase were about (24â€“54%), (21â€“49%), (21â€“47%), and (14â€“45%) of the system without RG on eutrophication, human toxicity-carcinogenic, ecotoxicity-freshwater, and ecotoxicity-marine, respectively. However, once fabrication & installation were added, RG had much higher net impacts than without RG, except for eutrophication and ecotoxicity-freshwater. Hence, the net ecotoxicity-freshwater impact was lower for all scenarios except 4 and 6 m2 RG sizes during dry rainfall conditions. The most feasible RWH scenarios (e.g., 2000 & 3000 L tanks) had net impacts of 3â€“81% of the RG systems on global warming, human toxicity-carcinogenic, and ecotoxicity-terrestrial categories. On the other hand, RWH had net impacts of 105â€“200% on ozone depletion and eutrophication and 51â€“119% on the ecotoxicity-freshwater and ecotoxicity-marine of the RG systems."
"Range sidelobe suppression using complementary sets in distributed multistatic radar networks Radar; Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO); Direction of Arrival We propose an alternative waveform scheme built on mutually-orthogonal complementary sets for a distributed multistatic radar. Our analysis and simulation show a reduced frequency band requirement for signal separation between antennas with centralized signal processing using the same carrier frequency. While the scheme can tolerate fluctuations of carrier frequencies and phases, range sidelobes arise when carrier frequencies between antennas are significantly different."
"Determination of economical thermal insulation thickness for a building wall with two parallel structures Walls (Structural Partitions); Hot Temperature; Insulation Because of the existence of beams, columns, shear walls, and other structural components, the external wall of a building is often composed of two parallel structures, wherein one is a concrete structure and the other is made of bricks. Therefore, to determine the economical thermal insulation thickness of an external wall, one can not only consider a single structure. Mathematical models of economical thermal insulation thickness considering and not considering the effect of non-homogeneity of external walls were established based on the method of life-cycle cost. The economical thermal insulation thickness and economic benefits of a building wall in Beijing that is composed of two parallel structures with EPS thermal insulation were comparatively analyzed. The comparisons were carried out with two different heat sources and three different concrete structure-to-external wall ratios. The results show that non-homogeneity of external walls have a considerable influence on the economical thermal insulation thickness and economic benefit of an insulating external wall. The economical thermal insulation thickness under the consideration of non-homogeneity of external walls will become thicker. However, the increase in life-cycle cost is not significant, whereas the increase in life-cycle saving is very significant, and the payback period becomes shorter. The effectiveness of the investment and the energy efficiency revenue without consideration of the effect of non-homogeneity of external walls are underestimated. Thus, a method that considers this effect can obtain more reasonable economical insulation thicknesses and economic benefits."
"Pricing risk and its use in modelling real estate market yields Office Markets; Certification; Commercial Real Estate Purpose: In the light of past financial and economic turmoil, there has been a marked increase in the volatility in real estate markets. This has impacted on the pricing of property assets, partly through market sentiment and particularly concerning risk. It also limits modelling accuracy model accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to create a new variable and model to enhance analysis of what drives real estate yields incorporating market sentiment to risk. Design/methodology/approach: This paper specifically considers the modelling of property pricing within a volatile economic environment. The theoretical context begins by analysing the relationship between property yields and government bonds. The analytical context then moves on to specifically include a measurement of risk which stresses its role and importance in investment markets since the Global Financial Crisis. The model thus incorporates macroeconomic and real estate data, together with an international risk multiplier, which is calculated within the paper. Findings: The paper finds the use of measurements of market sentiment and risk are more powerful tools for modelling yields than previous techniques alone. Research limitations/implications: This is an initial paper outlining the creation of sentiment and risk measurements in the financial market and showing an example of its application to a commercial real estate market. The implication is that this could add a major new explanatory variable to modelling of yields. Practical implications: The paper highlights the importance of risk in the pricing of commercial real estate, over and above normal variables. It highlights how this can help explain over and undershooting of yields within commercial real estate which would be of great importance in the investment world. Originality/value: This paper attempts to explicitly measure market sentiment, pricing of risk and how this impacts real estate pricing."
"Technology-Facilitated Sexual Violence Victimization: Results From an Online Survey of Australian Adults Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica Online forms of sexual harassment and abuse as experienced by adults represent an emerging yet under-researched set of behaviors, such that very few studies have sought to estimate the extent of the problem. This article presents the results of an online survey of 2,956 Australian adult (aged 18 to 54 years) experiences of technology-facilitated sexual violence (TFSV) victimization. The prevalence of TFSV was analyzed in relation to a 21-item scale developed in accordance with prior conceptual research identifying multiple dimensions of TFSV including digital sexual harassment, image-based sexual abuse, sexual aggression and/or coercion, and, gender and/or sexuality-based harassment (including virtual sexual violence). Results revealed significant differences in lifetime TFSV victimization for younger (18-24) and non-heterosexual identifying adults. Lifetime TFSV victimization for men and women was not significantly different, though women were more likely to report sexual harassment victimization and men were more likely to report victimization through the distribution of non-consensual images, as well as gender and/or sexuality-based harassment. The authors conclude that although women and men report experiencing similar overall prevalence of TFSV victimization, the nature and impacts of those experiences differ in particular gendered ways that reflect broader patterns in both gender relations and â€œofflineâ€ sexual harassment."
"Smoking in apartment buildings – Spatiality, meanings and understandings Smoking Ban; Tobacco Control; Nicotiana Tabacum Increased higher density urban living may exacerbate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Using a social practices lens, this research explored the locations, experiences and governance of smoking in apartment buildings in Melbourne, Australia, through semi-structured interviews in high-rise buildings ranging from subsidised housing to luxury apartments. Tacit rules on acceptable locations, building rules and smoke alarms in public areas consigned smoking to balconies and building entrances. The perceived health threat from second hand smoke and mental stress due to invasion of olfactory and visual privacy undermined the full enjoyment of the home environment. Interventions may benefit from targeting the link between smoking and balconies."
"Will Australia's common carp (Cyprinus carpio) populations develop resistance to Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) if released as a biocontrol agent? Identification of pathways and knowledge gaps Carps; Carp Edema Virus; Koi Due to its significant impacts on the environment and their overabundance in multiple waterways, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) has long been a target for control in southeastern Australia. Local eradication and site-based actions have had limited impacts, instigating national efforts to examine alternatives for effective long-term control, including the release of the exotic pathogen Cyprinid herpesvirus-3 (CyHV-3) as a biological control measure. First described in Germany and Israel in the late 1990s, CyHV-3 causes a serious clinical disease in carp but it is a species-specific virus with no evidence of it causing clinical or histological signs of disease in non-target species. Detailed modelling studies predict that in the short term this virus would effectively suppress high density populations of carp in the rivers and waterbodies of southeastern Australia, particularly in the southern Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). However, the long-term efficacy of CyHV-3 as a biocontrol remains more uncertain, owing to the possibility that the host will develop resistance allowing populations to recover. Here we review the literature to identify the factors that could influence the evolution of host resistance following the release of CyHV-3 in southeastern Australia and suggest follow-up strategies to address knowledge gaps. One of the factors identified as a risk is the influence of common carp hybrids, and the introgression of resistant genes from goldfish (Carassius auratus). Carp Ã— goldfish hybrids exist in southeastern Australia, and even though hybrids are generally not as ecologically fit as parental taxa, the impact of hybrids on the efficacy of CyHV-3 as a biocontrol at a population level needs further evaluation. Australian carp populations are most likely of western European ancestry, with no evidence suggesting that they bear genetic relatedness to resistant carp strains from the Amur river in northeastern Asia, but this needs to be confirmed through genetic comparison. Finally, considering that resistance to CyHV-3 is complex and polygenic, Amur-resistance alleles are absent in the Australian carp populations, and selection pressure on the host due to case fatality would be moderate (60â€“80% mortality), we predict that the evolution of host resistance arising from a random mutation in the genome will develop at a slow pace and resistance might take decades to impact on CyHV-3 field effectiveness."
"An examination of the interrelation between seaports and dry ports in developing countries: The case of Vietnam Container Port; Short Sea Shipping; Harbors (Waterways) This research aims at exploring the interrelation between seaports and dry ports in developing countries using the case of Vietnam. Apart from secondary data analysis, in-depth interviews were conducted with relevant stakeholders of the seaport-dry port system to derive insights of their interrelation patterns in the case of Vietnam. It was found that there are four patterns of seaport-dry port interrelation in the country. In the competing pattern, dry ports are developed as satellite terminals to conduct some of seaports' activities without having interrelation with seaports. In the independent pattern, dry ports are the region's load centres with no direct relationship with seaports. Thirdly, the collaborative pattern refers to the model in which seaports collaborate with specific dry ports to secure their markets. Finally, in the extended gate pattern, dry ports are developed by seaports to reach a larger and farther hinterland. Academic and managerial implications are discussed accordingly."
"Excitation wavelength dependent interfacial charge transfer dynamics in a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film Perovskite Solar Cells; Solar Cell; Formamidine Elucidation of interfacial charge separation and recombination mechanisms is crucial to improve performance of organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells. Here, we have investigated influence of initially populated electron and hole potential levels in a perovskite conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), respectively, by altering an excitation wavelength on interfacial charge separation and recombination dynamics in a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film sandwiched by a mesoporous TiO2 structure as an electron transport material (ETM) and a spiro-OMeTAD film as a hole transport material (HTM). Multi-phasic electron injection reactions are observed over <1.2 to several tens of nanoseconds, while most of holes are injected to a spiro-OMeTAD layer within the transient emission spectroscopy instrument response time (1.2 ns). In contrast, interfacial charge recombination rates are slower (from 5 ms to 1.3 s) with the increase of the excitation wavelength. These kinetics suggest that as long as low excitation intensity is employed, e.g. 10 nJ/cm2 or 1 sun (100 mW/cm2), the APCE of ~100% can be expected at any excitation wavelength for the solar cells based on FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/MAPbI3/OMeTAD films."
"Core–shell BiVO4@PDA composite photocatalysts on cotton fabrics for highly efficient photodegradation under visible light Bismuth Vanadium Tetraoxide; Photocatalytic Activity; Photocatalyst Abstract: Highly efficient and reusable photocatalysts that enable photodegradation of pollutants under visible light is the key in waste water treatment with impacts on environment and sustainable development. In this article, we report the preparation and application of a novel coreâ€“shell photocatalyst of bismuth vanadate@polydopamine (BiVO4@PDA). The optical absorption property and microstructure of the BiVO4@PDA particles were measured by ultravioletâ€“visible spectrophotoscopy (UVâ€“Vis), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope. The BiVO4@PDA can be attached to cotton fabrics by electrostatic assembly and molecular bonding. The morphology and structure of the cotton fabric@BiVO4@PDA were characterized by SEM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The photocatalytic activity results show that the methylene blue (MB) can be completely degraded by BiVO4@PDA under visible light irradiation within 250 min. Moreover, the mechanism for the MB photodegradation using the cotton fabric@BiVO4@PDA photocatalyst under visible light were investigated. With the novel coreâ€“shell structure, the as-developed BiVO4@PDA particles can be used as highly efficient photocatalysts for visible light driven photodegradation. The BiVO4@PDA particles can be attached to different substrates due to the excellent adhesive and bonding nature of PDA towards high-efficient photocatalysis.

"The role of packaging in fighting food waste: A systematised review of consumer perceptions of packaging Food Loss; Waste Prevention; Community Participation Food packaging is often viewed as having a negative impact on the environment. However, packaging can protect food, prolong shelf life, and reduce environmental impact by reducing food waste. Throughout the existing literature it is evident that consumer knowledge and levels of awareness, interest, and appreciation of these functions of packaging are major factors in their refusal or acceptance of emerging packaging technologies, whether those technologies are specifically directed at reducing food waste or not. The complex relationship consumers have with food packaging creates a barrier to food saving practices. This paper presents a systematised literature review of the existing scholarly and industry discussion of consumer food waste in households, packaging technologies to reduce food waste, and consumer perceptions of packaging. It maps the shifting theoretical approaches to food waste, showing a move in the literature away from food waste being treated as a food-related issue and towards seeing food waste as a waste-related, sustainability, production, and environmental issue. The paper finds that there is very little research that examines consumersâ€™ perceptions of food packaging. In particular, there is little research on the role of consumersâ€™ perceptions in reducing food waste. Mapping the ways different types of consumers perceive this role and linking this with a life cycle assessment of the overall environmental impact of food waste in different food categories could help the development of focused strategies for packaging design to reduce food waste in households. This review shows that technologies directly addressing the reasons for household food waste are under researched, and more research is needed to explicitly explore consumer perceptions, understandings, and acceptance of these packaging technologies."
"Lifestyles and mindsets of Olympic, Paralympic and world champions: Is an integrated approach the key to elite performance? Youth Sports; Football; Athletes Objectives The holy grail of any nation in the global sporting race is to better understand, replicate and sustain podium winning performances on the world stage. International sporting bodies advocate a holistic approach to the athletic profile and environmental and system-level factors required for world-class sporting performance, yet key lifestyle, relational, training and performance practices are commonly overlooked. We aimed to explore the contribution, interplay, and impact of lifestyle and psychological factors among a sample of world-class, champion athletes. Methods Open-ended, semistructured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 10 World, Olympic and Paralympic Champion athletes that covered their sporting development and athletic profile including their mindset, training and competition practices, along with lifestyle and other key factors to which they attributed their success. A thematic approach guided by grounded theory principles, was employed to source and analyse their perspectives and experiences and determine common themes. Results Four dominant and overlapping themes emerged: psychological attributes, interpersonal relationships, performance strategies and lifestyle practices. All athletes attributed their success to psychological rather than physical factors, and the vast majority relied on mental rehearsal skills and recovery practices. Conclusion The athletic profile and support required to reach and sustain podium-level performance is multidimensional, integrated and individualised and psychological factors are paramount. Championship performance is likely to occur at the intersection of psychological prowess, interpersonal support, effective performance strategies and lifestyle. An integrated approach inclusive of these dimensions can be used to guide athlete development and support at both an individual level and a collective level."
"Sustainability leaders in construction industry: A preliminary study Sustainability; Environmental Management Systems; Eco-Management and Audit Scheme With the increasing need of sustainable development globally, many world-leading construction companies have devoted great efforts to implementing sustainable practices. RobecoSAM publishes Sustainability Yearbook annually since 2004, which lists the sustainability leaders in various industries, including construction industry. Learning from those sustainability leaders in construction industry can provide useful references for construction related companies when developing their sustainable development strategies. Based on comprehensive literature review, this paper thus identified 51 methods used for improving sustainability performance and 34 outcomes achieved through these methods. The methods and outcomes are used for coding the sustainable practices of sustainability leaders in construction sector. With the coding system, sustainability reports issued by sustainability leaders in construction sector were analyzed with content analysis. Then, social network analysis was employed to identify the key adopted methods and achieved outcomes (KAMAO) from these leaders. The findings provide valuable guidance for international contractors to have a better understanding of the top sustainable methods adopted by sustainability leaders in construction sector and the top outcomes achieved by these leaders."
"Global synthesis of conservation studies reveals the importance of small habitat patches for biodiversity Conservation Planning; Reserve Design; Environmental Protection Island biogeography theory posits that species richness increases with island size and decreases with isolation. This logic underpins much conservation policy and regulation, with preference given to conserving large, highly connected areas, and relative ambivalence shown toward protecting small, isolated habitat patches. We undertook a global synthesis of the relationship between the conservation value of habitat patches and their size and isolation, based on 31 systematic conservation planning studies across four continents. We found that small, isolated patches are inordinately important for biodiversity conservation. Our results provide a powerful argument for redressing the neglect of small, isolated habitat patches, for urgently prioritizing their restoration, and for avoiding simplistic application of island biogeography theory in conservation decisions."
"Engaging with uncertainty and ambiguity through participatory 'Adaptive Pathways' approaches: Scoping the literature Robust Decision Making; Climate Change Adaptation; Uncertainty Analysis Climate change adaptation planning demands decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. Adaptive Pathways (AP) planning is receiving increased attention as a method to guide adaptation planning in the face of uncertainties. The approach has been most extensively developed and applied in large, well-funded contexts such as the Thames Barrier and Dutch Delta program. However, the development of AP planning has focused much less on the parallel need for engaging with the challenge of ambiguity - that there are diverse, sometimes contending, knowledges, values, and stakes involved. A more nascent body of work has been exploring ways of engaging with both the uncertainties and ambiguities of adaptation through various participatory approaches to AP planning. This paper sought to synthesise insights from this emerging work. Examining the peer-reviewed and grey literature identified eight cases from four countries across five different policy issues that provided details of how they approached diverse participation. Analysis of this small suite of cases provided some key insights for those seeking to use participatory approaches to AP planning to engage with the inherent uncertainties and (arguably necessary) ambiguities of adaptation. The paper concludes with a call for greater publication of details regarding how participatory approaches to methods such as AP planning have been undertaken not just what was undertaken."
"An alternative model for evaluating the balance of carrying capacity between functional urban infrastructures Ecological Carrying Capacity; Environmental Protection; Water Resources Urban infrastructures commonly include four types of functional infrastructures: traditional infrastructures, greenspace infrastructures, water infrastructures, and connective infrastructures. They work as an integrated system for supporting sustainable urban development. It is therefore important for having a proper method to help understand whether there is a balance between functional urban infrastructures' carrying capacities (FUICC). This paper introduces an alternative model named FUICC Catastrophe Model (FCM) to evaluate the balance of carrying capacity between various urban infrastructures. The development of the model FCM adopts Mean-Variance Analysis (MVA) technique and Catastrophe Progression Method (CPM) collectively. The application of FCM is demonstrated by using the empirical data collected from 35 cities in China. The research findings suggest that: 1) the difference in carrying capacity of each functional infrastructure between the sample cities is significant; 2) the difference in the degree of balance between FUICC is also significant between the sample cities; 3) the sample cities are classified into four categories, namely, acceptably balanced, less balanced, poorly balanced, and unbalanced. 4) the balance performance between FUICC among Chinese cities is characterized with polarization; 5) the balance performance of carrying capacity between functional urban infrastructures is generally poor in China, 40% of the sample cities achieving acceptable performance."
"A Bourdieusian analysis of employment services workers in an era of Workfirst Employment Service; Activation; Welfare Reform This article draws on qualitative research which focused on worker experiences of Workfirst activation during the Job Services Australia (JSA) contract of employment services. The Workfirst orientation of Australian labour market programmes created imperatives for activation workers to monitor job seeker compliance with activity tests. As part of the broader cohort interviewed in the study, activation workers were interviewed about the way sanctions were used to discipline job seekers in street-level exchanges. These workers had experienced the transition from the Job Network to JSA and had observed how a shift to Workfirst became institutionalised in organisational practices and culture. Concepts from Bourdieu's field theory are used to situate activation workers in the employment services field that became more managerial during the transition to Workfirst and where sanction-based practice was mainstreamed. Drawing also on Peillon's sociology of welfare, employment services are described as part of the welfare field in which the activation workers experienced the misrecognition associated with Workfirst, which is described as a structure of domination. The analysis employs the concept of intersubjective recognition to draw attention to the subjective and objective co-construction of street-level interactions. This study has implications for understanding how welfare reforms affect activation workers, the contributors to the erosion of employment services capability, and the need for investment in workforce development in the employment services sector."
"Determining thresholds for spatial urban design and transport features that support walking to create healthy and sustainable cities: findings from the IPEN Adult study Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians An essential characteristic of a healthy and sustainable city is a physically active population. Effective policies for healthy and sustainable cities require evidence-informed quantitative targets. We aimed to identify the minimum thresholds for urban design and transport features associated with two physical activity criteria: at least 80% probability of engaging in any walking for transport and WHO's target of at least 15% relative reduction in insufficient physical activity through walking. The International Physical Activity and the Environment Network Adult (known as IPEN) study (N=11 615; 14 cities across ten countries) provided data on local urban design and transport features linked to walking. Associations of these features with the probability of engaging in any walking for transport and sufficient physical activity (â‰¥150 min/week) by walking were estimated, and thresholds associated with the physical activity criteria were determined. Curvilinear associations of population, street intersection, and public transport densities with walking were found. Neighbourhoods exceeding around 5700 people per km2, 100 intersections per km2, and 25 public transport stops per km2 were associated with meeting one or both physical activity criteria. Shorter distances to the nearest park were associated with more physical activity. We use the results to suggest specific target values for each feature as benchmarks for progression towards creating healthy and sustainable cities."
"Removal of heavy metals from wastewater using low-cost biochar prepared from jackfruit seed waste Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon The present study focuses on using jackfruit seed waste (JSW) for bioremediation of heavy toxic metals from water. The fruit is abundantly grown in India and Far East countries and produces myriad tons of seeds. A simple procedure is developed in the laboratory by thermally activating JSW by orthophosphoric acid at 500 Â°C. Surface morphology, porosity, and structural analyses of the resultant biochar were conducted. The activated biochar was applied for batch adsorption of several heavy metal ions: Fe(III), Cd(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), and Mn(VII) at pH 7. The average heavy metal uptake by activated JSW biochar is 76.4 mg gâˆ’1, 79.4 mg gâˆ’1, 97.9 mg gâˆ’1, 79.9 mg gâˆ’1, and 79.8 mg gâˆ’1 for Fe(III), Pb(II), Cu(II), Cd(II), and Mn(VII), respectively. The experimental conditions were optimized to remove heavy metals at neutral pH. The adsorption process was exothermic, and Langmuir and pseudo-second-order kinetic study models were best fitted. The observation was in close agreement with the experimental data. Thermal and structural characterization of biochar at post-adsorption analyses was conducted. The study has distinguished features of simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and viability compared to many of the literature-reported biomass waste.

"Tweeting from the past: Commemorating the Anzac Centenary @ABCNews1915 Memorialization; Grief; Social Media This article argues that the digital world has introduced new complexities to state commemoration of the past and public engagement with those efforts. It focuses on how national narratives are transmitted by and through particular digital lieux de mÃ©moire; on how the archival trace of the past is presented as lively and emergent, even when the people it represents are long dead; and the implications for the temporalities of national history and memory of new digital forms of state commemoration. To make these arguments, it draws on the April 2015 â€˜live tweetingâ€™ by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation of the Anzac landing on the Gallipoli peninsula. It will use material from Twitter handle @ABCNews1915 to trace some of the links between state commemoration and the digital world, a relationship that has become more urgent in light of the increasing use of social media to articulate state-sponsored history and to communicate between states and individuals."
"Decoupling wastewater impacts from hydrogeochemical trends in impacted groundwater resources Nitrate Pollution; Denitrification; Isotopes In the urban environment, anthropogenic activities provide numerous potential sources of contamination, which can often lead to difficulties in identifying the processes impacting groundwater quality (natural and anthropogenic). This is particularly relevant at Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) that are often subject to changes in land use and composition of contaminant sources over time and space, as well as multiple potential hydrogeochemical interactions. To help address this issue, we demonstrate how long-term time-series analysis of major ions and key contaminants of concern, which are routinely collected by WWTP operators, can be analysed using hydrogeochemical plotting tools, multivariate statistics and targeted isotopic analysis, to provide a means of better characterising key hydrogeochemical influences and anthropogenic inputs. Application of this approach to a WWTP in south-eastern Australia indicated that anthropogenic impacts were the primary driver influencing the local hydrogeochemical environment and groundwater quality. However, secondary processes, including mineral (particularly calcite) dissolution, ion exchange and possible dedolomitisation, as well as natural degradation/transformation of contaminants were also important. Long-term, time-series analysis of trends in NO3-N, NH4-N, Ca2+, SO42âˆ’, HCO3âˆ’ and K+ in conjunction with the other lines of evidence, allowed for enhanced separation between individual contaminant sources, particularly when paired with a detailed site history and Conceptual Site Model (CSM). This indicated that off-site agricultural impacts post-date most site derived impacts, and to date, have not significantly added to the identified contaminant plume. The outcomes of this work have significant global application in the identification, assessment, and control of environmental and health risks at complex sites and show how significant value (rarely obtained) can be derived from the analysis of routine monitoring datasets, particularly when analysed using a multiple lines of evidence approach."
"Opening the black box of the sport event volunteer’s journey: from candidate to volunteer Sports; Corporate Citizenship; Sports Events Research question: This paper investigates candidatesâ€™ journey to being selected as a volunteer for the Rio2016 Games. Drawing on Actorâ€“Network Theory, the research tracked the sociomaterial practices undertaken by candidates to become volunteers and sought to identify the actors that participate in these practices and the role the latter played in facilitating a positive (or negative) experience. Research method: A postmodern ethnography provided the basis to critically analyse candidatesâ€™ experiences in applying for a volunteer role at the Games. Data were collected via internet sites, email communications, a volunteer Facebook page, interviews with volunteers (N = 17) and official Rio 2016 documents. Results and Findings: The journey to volunteering at Rio 2016 comprised sociomaterial practices that impacted the volunteer candidateâ€™s progression (or lack thereof) through the journey to volunteering. These were qualifying as a candidate, Waiting for â€˜Godotâ€™, Being rejected and Getting the â€˜passportâ€™ to the Games. Implications: This research presents a practice-based conceptualisation of volunteer candidatesâ€™ journey to selection. The findings demonstrate the centrality of sociomaterial practices in volunteer recruitment and the importance of an effective human and non-human interface. Flexible approaches to volunteer recruitment and selection that consider the diversity of interactions of actors involved can be profitably deployed to facilitate a good candidate experience and minimise the stress, tension and communication issues that potential volunteers face."
"The Myth of the ‘Ideal Offender’: Challenging persistent human trafficking stereotypes through emerging Australian cases Human Trafficking; Sexual Exploitation; Prostitution Human trafficking and slavery offences are often constructed through prominent stereotypes of the ideal victim and the ideal offender. This article examines four common offender stereotypes created by representations of trafficking seen in the media, popular culture, government reports, and awareness campaigns, and challenges these stereotypes by comparing them with international and Australian research and statistics. This comparison demonstrates that the ideal trafficking offender is a myth that must be broken. To support this argument, the article explores two emerging Australian cases involving sexual exploitation and allegations of slavery and servitude that significantly depart from stereotypical representations of trafficking. This shows the limitations of offender stereotypes in explaining trafficking offences and demonstrates the need for greater emphasis on the role of coercive control in trafficking offences, the impact of trust and changing relationships, and the interrelationship of trafficking with domestic violence."
"Inundation of a floodplain lake woodlands system: nutritional profiling and benefit to mature Eucalyptus largiflorens (Black Box) trees Black Box; Murraya; Salt Stress River management continues to challenge riparian systems worldwide, with climate change impacts and anthropogenic extractions escalating. The Murrayâ€“Darling basin (MDB) in Australia is critical to agricultural production and habitat provision to maintain biodiversity. Concern for the condition of native trees and biota in the MDB has led to substantial research investment to increase ecosystem function understanding and improve floodplain and wetland management. This field study offers new insights into tree nutrition and physiology as interpreted against the plant-soil-environment dynamics of recent flooding. Black Box (Eucalyptus largiflorens (Myrtaceae) is the only key native riverine MDB tree restricted to that region; and appears stressed at the far reaches of certain significant floodplain ecosystems. Here, nutritional and ecophysiological comparisons were made between Black Box trees that had just been inundated, and those nearby that had not. Leaf stomatal conductance, transpiration, total soil aluminium (Al) concentration, soil pH, and soil conductivity were different between inundated and dry sites. Soil moisture increased due to inundation, thus reducing tree water stress across the three study locations. Changes in leaf chemistry were not detected at the very early stages of flooding examined in this study. An increase in soil acidity due to inundation may also enhance bioavailability of nutrients to trees. New insight into immediate plant benefits gained from this study suggests further investigation is warranted to elucidate the influence of flood and drought on nutrient balance and how future wetland management can benefit from a more holistic understanding of plant-soil-environment dynamics."
"A new framework for assessing the environmental impacts of circular economy friendly soil waste-based geopolymer cements Life Cycle Assessment; Carbon Dioxide; Cradle-To-Gate Portland cement is one of the principal constituents used as a building material and is responsible for high energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Any attempt to reduce cement usage would make savings in energy usage and GHG emissions. A case study of Portland cement (CEM-I) replacement using alkali activated soil filter cake as a geopolymer mortar is presented to demonstrate application of a three-stage GHG emission estimation and comparison methodology using a process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) study, with a focus on benchmarking environmental sustainability. Results indicate that the alkali activated soil filter cake reduced total GHG emissions by 31% compared with CEM-I, which equates to 110 kgCO2-eq/m3. Transportation by rail was found to be more sustainable compared with by road, with an overall higher GHG emission reduction of between 5 and 10%. For road transport, heavy goods vehicles (HGV) of between 3.5t and 5.7t recorded the highest GHG emissions whilst articulated lorries recorded the lowest GHG emissions. Furthermore, the results also demonstrated that a bulk carrier is the most environmentally sustainable option for overseas raw material transportation. Monte-Carlo simulations signified the likelihood of achieving lowered GHG emissions when considering commercial production and inventory changes across different countries varies from 18% to 71%. These results highlight the importance of critical analysis of several factors which contribute towards overall environmental sustainability, prior to decision making on sustainable materials. Further research is encouraged on developing processes and methodologies to prioritize selection of sustainable materials to optimize sustainable benefits."

New insight into immediate plant benefits gained from this study suggests further investigation is warranted to elucidate the influence of flood and drought on nutrient balance and how future wetland management can benefit from a more holistic understanding of plant-soil-environment dynamics."
"Network classification for traffic management: Anomaly detection, feature selection, clustering and classification Transfer Of Learning; Network Management; Internet Service Providers With the massive increase of data and traffic on the Internet within the 5G, IoT and smart cities frameworks, current network classification and analysis techniques are falling short. Novel approaches using machine learning algorithms are needed to cope with and manage real-world network traffic, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised classification techniques. Accurate and effective classification of network traffic will lead to better quality of service and more secure and manageable networks. This authored book investigates network traffic classification solutions by proposing transport layer methods to achieve better run and operated enterprise-scale networks. The authors explore novel methods for enhancing network statistics at the transport layer, helping to identify optimal feature selection through a global optimization approach and providing automatic labelling for raw traffic through a SemTra framework to maintain provable privacy on information disclosure properties."
"Sustainable criterion selection framework for green building materials – An optimisation based study of fly-ash Geopolymer concrete Geopolymers; Coal Ash; Alkali Green materials are considered as one of the prominent elements in designing an environmentally sustainable construction project. Studies have highlighted cement replacement is a popular method of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and replacing virgin materials in concrete. These options incur cost implications through sophisticated designs and technologies. The importance of maintaining a balance between environmental and economic benefits of a green design is critical for the decision making stakeholders in a construction project. However, designers often lack the resources and tools to initiate informed decision making for the optimum selection of a green material. In order to systemize the optimising process, the current study suggests a multi-objective optimisation based decision making framework for optimising the cement replacement materials in concrete. The study aims to present a sustainable criterion optimisation framework that could well be adopted to assess the sustainability of green materials in concrete production. A case study using fly ash geopolymer concrete in Melbourne demonstrated a reduction of 3.63% to 41.57% and 23.80% to 30.25% can be achieved for GHG emissions and production cost respectively if the developed optimisation based framework is implemented. The scenario results highlighted around 3% to 8% GHG and cost increase if material is not available locally. A similar approach can be utilised to optimise the environmental and cost savings of other cement replacement materials. Further studies are encouraged on comparing environmental and cost savings of other cement replacement materials using the developed framework. The framework will be valuable for designers in making decisions on sustainable cement replacement materials."
"Governing youth politics in the age of surveillance Social Movements; Protest; Activism Drawing on case studies from around the world, contributors to this ground-breaking book explore a major contemporary paradox: on the one hand, young people today are at the forefront of political campaigns promoting social rights and ethical ideas that challenge authoritarian orders and elite privileges. On the other hand, too many governments, some claiming to be committed to liberal-democratic values, social inclusion and youth participation are engaged in repressing political activities that contest the status quo. Contributors to this book explore how, especially since 9/11, governments, state agencies and other traditional power holders around the globe have reacted to political dissent authored by young people. While the â€˜needâ€™ to enhance â€˜youth political participationâ€™ is promoted, the cases in this book document how states are using everything from surveillance, summary offences, expulsion from universities, â€˜gag lawsâ€™ and â€˜antiterrorismâ€™ legislation, and even imprisonment to repress certain forms of young peopleâ€™s political activism. These responses diminish the public sphere and create civic spaces hostile to political participation by any citizen. This book forms part of The Criminalization of Political Dissent series. It documents and interprets the many ways contemporary governments and agencies now routinely use various techniques to repress and criminalise political dissent."
"Liveability aspirations and realities: Implementation of urban policies designed to create healthy cities in Australia Built Environment; Exercise; Pedestrians Creating healthy, liveable cities is a common policy aspiration globally. However, little research has explored the capacity of urban policies to deliver this aspiration, or levels of policy implementation. This study aimed to develop policy-relevant indicators, to detect within- and between-city inequities in the implementation of Australian state government policy targets related to urban liveability. Seventy-three government policies were reviewed across Australia's four largest cities to identify measurable spatial policies that contribute to creating healthy, liveable neighbourhoods. Spatial indicators based on these policies were developed to assess and map levels of policy implementation at the metropolitan and sub-metropolitan level. Measurable spatial policies were identified for only three out of seven policy domains: walkability, transit access, and public open space. While there was significant variation between cities, policies were often inconsistent with evidence about how to achieve liveability. No Australian city performed well on all liveability domains. Even modest policy targets were often not achieved, and there were significant spatial inequities in policy implementation. With few exceptions, people living in outer suburbs had poorer access to amenities than inner-city residents. This study demonstrates the benefits and challenges of measuring urban policy implementation. Evidence-informed targets are needed in urban, transport and infrastructure policies designed to create healthy, liveable cities, to enable levels of (and inequities in) policy implementation to be assessed. Consistent standards for government spatial data would enable development of comparable indicators and cities to be directly compared."
"Engineering two-dimensional metal oxides and chalcogenides for enhanced electro- and photocatalysis Catalyst; Cobalt Phosphide; Water Splitting Two-dimensional (2D) metal oxides and chalcogenides (MOs & MCs) have been regarded as a new class of promising electro- and photocatalysts for many important chemical reactions such as hydrogen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction reaction and N2 reduction reaction in virtue of their outstanding physicochemical properties. However, pristine 2D MOs & MCs generally show the relatively poor catalytic performances due to the low electrical conductivity, few active sites and fast charge recombination. Therefore, considerable efforts have been devoted to engineering 2D MOs & MCs by rational structural design and chemical modification to further improve the catalytic activities. Herein, we comprehensively review the recent advances for engineering technologies of 2D MOs & MCs, which are mainly focused on the intercalation, doping, defects creation, facet design and compositing with functional materials. Meanwhile, the relationship between morphological, physicochemical, electronic, and optical properties of 2D MOs & MCs and their electro- and photocatalytic performances is also systematically discussed. Finally, we further give the prospect and challenge of the field and possible future research directions, aiming to inspire more research for achieving high-performance 2D MOs & MCs catalysts in energy storage and conversion fields."
"Ladies selling breakfast: COVID-19 disruption of intimate socialities among street-engaged food traders in Ho Chi Minh city Vietnam; Wildcat Strike; Urbanization Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnamâ€™s largest city, supports a vibrant street food culture. Most of the cityâ€™s street-engaged food traders are poor and unskilled women, and there is scant research about how they build social networks and social capital that sustain their micro-businesses. This article focusses on the intimate socialities that street-engaged food traders develop with customers, shop owners and sister-traders in order to stabilise their incomes while their informal street-trading activities are policed and potentially shut down. Recent COVID-19 lockdown and social-distancing measures disrupted the crucial interpersonal relations of street trading and left the traders with no income. This article explores tradersâ€™ strate-gies for achieving economic security, and outlines transformations of intimate socialities into mediated and digital relations after the lockdown."
"Development of a novel compressive strength design equation for natural and recycled aggregate concrete through advanced computational modeling Concrete Aggregates; Construction and Demolition Waste; Mechanical Properties Owing to the variations in the recycled coarse aggregates (RCA) characteristics, the compressive strength prediction of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) is a complex challenge causing hindrance in the design guidelines development and practical application of RAC. This study aims to develop a unified compressive strength model for the RAC and natural aggregate concrete (NAC) independent of RCA source and other properties. For this reason, four input parameters, including water absorption of coarse aggregates, effective water-to-cement ratio, coarse aggregates to cement ratio, and RCA replacement ratio, are considered to predict the compressive strength of NAC and RAC. Ten machine-learning techniques, including random forest, gradient boost, Ada boost, k-nearest neighbor, bagging regressor, support vector, XG boost, decision tree, artificial neural network, and gene expression programming, are evaluated through a test database having 962 experimental results of compressive strength of NAC and RAC from 107 different studies. The performance of machine-learning algorithms is assessed through various statistical parameters. Results show that the input parameters (considered in this study) are essential in predicting the cubic and cylindrical compressive strength of NAC and RAC. The machine learning models and comprehensive design equations developed in this study are better than existing models and can be recommended as an effective tool for predicting the compressive strength of NAC and RAC having RCA from different sources, leading toward the development of sustainable concrete design guidelines."
"Selection of industrial trade waste resource recovery technologies-A systematic review Distillation; Direct Contact; Membrane Industrial wastewater and other trade wastes are often sources of pollution which can cause environmental damage. However, resource recovery approaches have the potential to lead to positive environmental outcomes, profits, and new sources of finite commodities. Information on these waste sources, and the valuable components which may be contained in such waste is increasingly being made available by public, academic and commercial stakeholders (including companies active in meat processing, dairy, brewing, textile and other sectors). Utilising academic and industry literature, this review evaluates several methods of resource recovery (e.g., bioreactors, membrane technologies, and traditional chemical processes) and their advantages and disadvantages in a trade waste setting. This review lays the groundwork for classification of waste and resource recovery technologies, in order to inform process choices, which may lead to wider commercial application of these technologies. Although each waste source and recovery process is unique, membrane bioreactors show promise for a wide range of resource recovery applications. Despite interest, uptake of resource recovery technologies remains low, or not widely championed. For this to change, knowledge needs to increase in several key areas including: availabilities and classification of trade wastes, technology choice processes, and industrial viability."
"'I didn't even know it was a thing': Australian young adults' experience of economic abuse Intimate Partner Violence; Domestic Violence; Economics of Scale Economic abuse is a form of intimate partner violence that involves one partner controlling or restricting, exploiting or sabotaging the economic resources of the other partner. Little is known how economic abuse manifests in young people's relationships or how to prevent it. This study explored young adults' experiences of economic abuse and identified the factors associated with economic abuse in their relationships. Twenty-four young adults (18 women and 6 men) aged 18-29, were interviewed in-depth using both unstructured narrative and semi-structured interview questions. Thematic analysis was used to identify forms of economic abuse. Common experiences of economic abuse included: exploitation of financial and other resources, controlling access to money, damage to property and sabotage of employment and study. The contextual factors included lack of awareness of economic abuse, valuing love and relationships over money and fear of conflict and rejection. We argue that economic abuse prevention strategies should target young adults in their relationship formation stage and take into account the context of relationships and the issues young people face when venturing into cohabitation."
"Effectiveness of porous silicon nanoparticle treatment at inhibiting the migration of a heterogeneous glioma cell population Cancer Stem Cell; Glioblastoma; Brain Neoplasms Background: Approximately 80% of brain tumours are gliomas. Despite treatment, patient mortality remains high due to local metastasis and relapse. It has been shown that transferrin-functionalised porous silicon nanoparticles (Tf@pSiNPs) can inhibit the migration of U87 glioma cells. However, the underlying mechanisms and the effect of glioma cell heterogeneity, which is a hallmark of the disease, on the efficacy of Tf@pSiNPs remains to be addressed. Results: Here, we observed that Tf@pSiNPs inhibited heterogeneous patient-derived glioma cellsâ€™ (WK1) migration across small perforations (3 Î¼m) by approximately 30%. A phenotypical characterisation of the migrated subpopulations revealed that the majority of them were nestin and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 positive, an indication of their cancer stem cell origin. The treatment did not inhibit cell migration across large perforations (8 Î¼m), nor cytoskeleton formation. This is in agreement with our previous observations that cellular-volume regulation is a mediator of Tf@pSiNPsâ€™ cell migration inhibition. Since aquaporin 9 (AQP9) is closely linked to cellular-volume regulation, and is highly expressed in glioma, the effect of AQP9 expression on WK1 migration was investigated. We showed that WK1 migration is correlated to the differential expression patterns of AQP9. However, AQP9-silencing did not affect WK1 cell migration across perforations, nor the efficacy of cell migration inhibition mediated by Tf@pSiNPs, suggesting that AQP9 is not a mediator of the inhibition. Conclusion: This in vitro investigation highlights the unique therapeutic potentials of Tf@pSiNPs against glioma cell migration and indicates further optimisations that are required to maximise its therapeutic efficacies.

"Examining the relationship between urban liveability and gender-based violence: A systematic review. Alcohol Drinking; Underage Drinking; Neighborhood Characteristics Gender-based violence can include, but is not limited to, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, rape, and intimate partner homicide. It is well-established that gender inequality is the main driver of gender-based violence. However, little work has attempted to unpack how gender-based violence perpetuates within the neighbourhood context, and whether â€˜liveabilityâ€™ attributes might intersect with gender inequality and violence. We systematically reviewed quantitative evidence examining associations between gender-based violence and several liveability neighbourhood-level factors. MEDLINE (Ovid) and Scopus databases yielded 1822 potentially relevant articles. 50 articles met inclusion criteria. Neighbourhood social capital was most consistently associated with reduced gender-based violence. Few studies examined built environment attributes (e.g. gambling venue densities, access to services). Future research is needed to more deeply examine how combinations of salutogenic or pathogenic neighbourhood attributes may reinforce or prevent violence."
"Using GNSS data for real-time moisture analysis and forecasting over the Australian Region I. The system Precipitable Water; Global Positioning System; GNSS The use of high spatial and temporal resolution data assimilation and forecasting around Australia's capital cities and rural land provides an opportunity to improve moisture analysis and forecasting. To support this endeavour, RMIT University and Geoscience Australia have worked with the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) to provide real-time GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Zenith Total Delay (ZTD) data over the Australian region, from which a high-resolution total water vapour field for SE Australia can be determined. The ZTD data can play an important role in high-resolution data assimilation by providing mesoscale moisture data coverage from existing GNSS surface stations over significant areas of the Australian continent. The data are now used by the BoM's high-resolution ACCESS-C3 capital city NWP systems, the ACCESS-G3 Global system and have been used by the ACCESS-R2-Regional NWP model. A description of the data collection and analysis system is provided. An example of the application of these local GNSS data for a heavy rainfall event over SE Australia/Victoria is shown using the 1.5km resolution ACCESS-C3 model, which is being prepared for operational use. The results from the test have been assessed qualitatively/synoptically and also have been examined quantitatively using the Fractions Skills Score which shows the reasonableness of the forecasts and demonstrates the potential for improving rainfall forecasts over south-eastern Australia by the inclusion of ZTD data in constructing the moisture field. These data have now been accepted for operational use in NWP."
"Ergonomic considerations for designing truck drivers' seats: The case of Bangladesh Period Prevalence; Furniture; Anthropometry Objectives: The purpose of this work was to investigate the fitness of the existing truck seats for Bangladeshi truck drivers and suggest a guideline for drivers' seats based on their anthropometry. Methodology: In this study, eight anthropometric measurements of 120 Bangladeshi truck drivers and seven seat dimensions of ninety trucks of three brands namely, TATA, ASHOK LEYLAND, and ISUZU were considered for investigating the considerable mismatch between seat dimensions and drivers' anthropometry. The data were analyzed using two-sample t-tests to identify the relationship between existing seat dimensions and drivers' anthropometry. Results: The results showed a mismatch in seat dimensions and anthropometric measurements for nearly all truck brands and the existing seat dimensions were found to be inappropriate for Bangladeshi drivers. For all the truck brands, the percentage mismatch of seat height, seat depth, seat width, backrest height, and steering wheel clearance varied between 71% and 98%, 23% and 79%, 33% and 84%, 28% and 65%, and 53% and 100% respectively. Subsequently, an attempt was made to provide ergonomically correct seat dimensions for Bangladeshi truck drivers. Further, generalized equations to design the appropriate seat dimensions were developed using the least square regression technique. The recommended seat height, depth and width, backrest height, and steering wheel clearance were found to be appropriate for 82%, 79%, 76%, 98%, and 100% of drivers respectively. Conclusion: The analysis and results of this study can be useful in developing guidelines for design and manufacture of truck driver seats in Bangladesh."
"Sustainable development carbon pricing initiative and voluntary environmental disclosures quality Corporate Social Responsibility; Sustainability Reporting; Global Reporting Initiative Although corporate environmental disclosures have been researched extensively, empirical evidence regarding the indirect impact of carbon pricing on firms' voluntary disclosures is scarce. The objective of this study is to identify the indirect impact of carbon pricing initiatives on the voluntary environmental disclosures (VEDs) of electricity generating companies, analyzed through the lens of institutional theory. This study adds to the growing literature on the determinants of VED, investigating the impact of adoption of the Global Reporting Initiative and ISO 14001 on VED. Secondary data were collected from 2015 annual reports and/or standalone sustainability reports of electricity generating companies from 53 countries around the world. Content analysis approach was adopted for measuring the extent of the quality of VED. Findings of multiple regression analysis suggest that there is an indirect institutional impact of carbon pricing on the quality of VED. This study also finds that, as the form of nongovernment guidance, the Global Reporting Initiative adoption and ISO 14001 certification also have an institutional influence on the VED. VED is also affected by company size although this study reveals no significant relationship of leverage with VED."
"‘I’m fired up now!’: digital cataloguing, community archives, and unintended opportunities for individual and archival digital inclusion Cultural Heritage; Archival Science; Forms and Records Control Through documenting, preserving, and making local heritage accessible, digital cataloguing offers community archives significant potential benefits. But undertaking digital cataloguing in this context is not without challenges. Community archives depend on intermittent funding, have restricted access to digital connectivity and devices, and rely on elderly volunteers who often lack the digital skills required. Following Thomas and colleaguesâ€™ digital inclusion framework, which considers the capacity for accessing, affording, and having the digital abilities to â€˜use online technologies effectivelyâ€™ (Thomas J, Barraket J, Wilson C K, Holcombe-James I, Kennedy J, Rennie E, Ewing S, MacDonald T (2020) Measuring Australiaâ€™s digital divide: the Australian Digital Inclusion Index 2020. RMIT and Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, for Telstra, p 8), community archives can be considered digitally excluded. Through an ethnographic study of one community archiveâ€™s use of Victorian Collections, an Australian digital cataloguing platform, this article examines the impact of digital exclusion on digital cataloguing outcomes via metrics of quantity and quality. These indicate limited cataloguing outcomes, with community collections obscured, rather than revealed. But these metrics disregard the opportunities for enhancing individual and archival digital inclusion that learning how, and continuing, to digitally catalogue present. By tracing one elderly volunteerâ€™s journey from digitally excluded non-user to capable cataloguer, I show how digital cataloguing offered an opportunity for enhancing this individualâ€™s digital inclusion, simultaneously improving that of the archive. In considering these unintended opportunities, this article contributes to our understanding of how digital exclusion impacts the digitisation of cultural heritage, and offers scope for determining how the process and practice of digital cataloguing itself can present opportunities for inclusion at the individual and archival level."
"Object-based random forest classification for informal settlements identification in the Middle East: Jeddah a case study Remote Sensing Image; Image Analysis; Land Cover The identification of informal settlements in urban areas is an important step in developing and implementing pro-poor urban policies. Understanding when, where and who lives inside informal settlements is critical in efforts to improve their resilience. This study aims to analyse the capability of machine-learning (ML) methods to map informal settlement areas in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, using very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery and terrain data. Fourteen indicators of settlement characteristics were derived and mapped using an object-based ML approach and VHR imagery. These indicators were categorized according to three different spatial levels: environ, settlement and object. The most useful indicators for prediction were found to be density and texture measures, (with random forest (RF) relative importance measures of over 25% and 23% respectively). The success of this approach was evaluated using a small, fully independent validation dataset. Informal areas were mapped with an overall accuracy of 91%. Object-based ML as a processing chain approach performed better (8%) than object-based image analysis alone due to its ability to encompass all available geospatial levels."
"How do suppliers address stringent environmental requirements from buyers? An exploratory study in the Bangladesh ready-made garment industry Supply Chain; Environmentally Preferable Purchasing; Green Practices Purpose: Stakeholders such as customers, governments and environmental organisations are more concerned than ever about the impact of supply chain practices on the environment, leading firms to introduce environmental requirements into their supply contracts. While the extant literature on supply chains acknowledges this trend, it fails to inform comprehensively on the concept of â€œstringent environmental requirementâ€ and its consequences. The purpose of this paper is to investigate this concept and explore how such requirements may translate into supplier environmental performance. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative methodology was adopted by the study and data were collected through conducting eight case studies in the Bangladesh ready-made garment (RMG) industry. Findings: A number of factors were found to be influencing suppliersâ€™ perception of stringency, such as uncertainty relating to the newness and deadline of buyersâ€™ environmental requirements, the complexity of implementing the requirements, and the use of buyer-specific frameworks. The research also shows that suppliersâ€™ efforts in building environmental capability play a vital role in dealing with stringent environmental requirements. Research limitations/implications: The case studies are limited to the Bangladesh RMG industry. Given that environmental regulations vary across different countries and industries, the data may not reflect all the possible variations in stringent environmental requirements. Practical implications: The new insight proposed by this research can guide firms to further understand how supplier environmental performance and the sustainability of their supply chain can be achieved. The research provides broad insight into how suppliers can address stringent environmental requirements and improve their environmental performance. Originality/value: This research establishes evidence for the relatively new phenomenon of â€œstringent environmental requirementsâ€, and develops a theoretical framework to demonstrate the relationships among the critical determinants relevant to this phenomenon."
"Anti- HIV-1 activity of lactic acid in human cervicovaginal fluid Vagina Flora; Gardnerella Vaginalis; Atopobium Vaginae Women of reproductive age with a Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota have a reduced risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV and a vaginal pH of ~4 due to the presence of ~1% (wt/vol) lactic acid. While lactic acid has potent HIV virucidal activity in vitro, whether lactic acid present in the vaginal lumen inactivates HIV has not been investigated. Here we evaluated the anti-HIV-1 activity of native, minimally diluted cervicovaginal fluid obtained from women of reproductive age (n = 20) with vaginal microbiota dominated by Lactobacillus spp. Inhibition of HIVBa-L was significantly associated with the protonated form of lactic acid in cervicovaginal fluid. The HIVBa-L inhibitory activity observed in the < 3-kDa acidic filtrate was similar to that of the corresponding untreated native cervicovaginal fluid as well as that of clarified neat cervicovaginal fluid subjected to protease digestion. These ex vivo studies indicate that protonated lactic acid is a major anti-HIV-1 metabolite present in acidic cervicovaginal fluid, suggesting a potential role in reducing HIV transmission by inactivating virus introduced or shed into the cervicovaginal lumen."
"Shiny-DEG: A Web Application to Analyze and Visualize Differentially Expressed Genes in RNA-seq Cufflinks; RNA-Seq; Alternative Splicing Abstract: RNA-seq analysis has become one of the most widely used methods for biological and medical experiments, aiming to identify differentially expressed genes at a large scale. However, due to lack of programming skills and statistical background, it is difficult for biologists including faculty and students to fully understand what the RNA-seq results are and how to interpret them. In recent years, even though, there are several programs or websites that assist researchers to analyze and visualize NGS results, they have several limitations. Therefore, Shiny-DEG, a web application that facilitates the exploration and visualization of differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq, was developed. It integrates multi-factor design experiments, allows users to modify the parameters interactively according to experiments purpose and all analysis results can be downloaded directly, aiming to further assisting the interpretation and explanation of the biological questions. Therefore, it serves better for biologists without programming skills. Overall, this project is of great significance to reveal the mechanism of transcriptome differences."
"Cointegrating relationship and granger causal analysis in energy economics-a practical guidance Consumption Growth; Renewable Energy Consumption; Economic Growth Cointegrating relationship and Granger causal analysis are used widely inempirical macroeconomics, especially in energy economics. This chapter aims to provide a survey of the development of the two widely used econometric methodologies with a practical guidance on issues that should be considered in implementation and software packages that are available for usage. An example which studies the existence of cointegrating and Granger causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth is given to illustrate how such analysis can be carried out."
"MXenes in polymer electrolyte membrane hydrogen fuel and electrolyzer cells Transition Element; Sodium-ion Batteries; Ion Storage Electrolyzer cells (ECs) and hydrogen fuel cells (FCs) have efficiencies that may be further improved. Additionally, they suffer from degradation, durability, and high costs. While improvements are pursued also through novel designs, considerable literature has reported advances sought through novel materials such as MXenes as electrodes in the polymer electrolyte membranes (PEM) design. MXenes have interesting properties which can be further optimized through specific tuning. Strategies for improving the material activity, such as optimizing active sites by termination modification, metal-atom doping, and design of nanostructures to increase the active sites, may produce benefits. However, there is a lack of real-world applications of MXenes to PEM hydrogen FCs and ECs. Almost the totality of the works in the literature focuses on the material in isolation and on the optimization of only one parameter at a time to advance the specific application. Current studies do not include the fabrication of specific components which could benefit from MXenesâ€™ material properties to outperform within current systems. To develop specific products based on MXenes, there is a clear need for a system approach, based on prototyping and testing of the component within the system, to prove the advantages of the new material compared to current working options."
"Photocatalytic Activity of Carbon Nanotube/Zinc Oxide Nanocomposite for Solar Energy Based Water Treatment and Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting Photocatalytic Activity; Zinc Oxide; Zinc Acetate Fluorine doped Tin Oxide (FTO) was used as the substrate for the synthesis of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes/Zinc Oxide nanorods composites. The first composite was a layer-by-layer sample of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes/Zinc Oxide nanorods and the second was a mixed sample of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes/Zinc Oxide nanorods. Characterisation techniques including XRD, FE-SEM and UV-Visible spectroscopy were performed on both the composites to investigate the diffraction peaks, morphology and band gap energy, respectively. Dye degradation and Photoeletrochemical (PEC) performance of both the composites were studied and the results proved that the photocatalytic activity and the photoelectrochemical performance were improved by the incorporation of MWCNT with ZnO nanorods. The highest dye degradation of 64.44% and 39.57% under UV and AM1.5G illumination and the highest photocurrent density of 1.5x10-4 A/cm2 and 8.0x10-5A/cm2 under UV and AM1.5G illumination were achieved by the MWCNT/ZnO layer-by-layer sample. This makes MWCNT/ZnO nanorods layer-by-layer sample a promising candidate for the removal of organic dyes from waste waters and for the production of Hydrogen as a source of sustainable energy by using the abundant light energy for water splitting."
"Effect of Star Rating Improvement of Residential Buildings on Life Cycle Environmental Impacts and Costs Embodied Energy; Sustainability; Green Building A diagnostic framework is proposed to assess the influence of star rating improvement for residential buildings on life cycle environmental impacts and life cycle costs (LCEI and LCC) using life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing methods, respectively, on all life cycle phases (i.e., construction, operation, maintenance, and disposal). A reference house was modified on the basis of six alternative designs to deliver a particular star rating in order to demonstrate the analysis framework. Two LCIA methods (i.e., material flows/add masses and eco-indicator 99 Australian substances) were used to estimate ten LCEI indicators under two categories: seven from problem-oriented (i.e., raw material, air emission, water emission, eco-toxicity, acidification/eutrophication potential, ozone depletion, and climate change) and three from damage-oriented (i.e., resource depletion, ecosystem quality, and effect on human health) categories. The three damage-oriented indicators were combined to evaluate environmental and economic wellbeing on a single eco-point basis. All these combinations of impact indicators can offer three lines of analytical options along with star rating: problem-oriented, damage-oriented, and a variety of problem and damage-oriented LCEIs with LCCs. Hence, the optimum house selection is-based not only on cost or star rating, but also on LCEIs."
"How do sporting organisations conceptualise and operationalise the prevention of violence against women? Sexual Assault; Bystander; Crime Victims Sport settings have great potential to influence social change and are therefore important locations to engage in the prevention of violence against women. The following study draws on in-depth interviews with 16 stakeholders who have been involved with the implementation of prevention programmes within competitive/team sport settings. A qualitative thematic analysis of the interviews was undertaken to examine how sporting organisations understand, strategise and practise prevention work in Australia and New Zealand. Implications for long-term changes in the prevention of violence against women are discussed with reference to key prevention actions and frameworks."
"Nutrient removal by alginate-immobilized Chlorella vulgaris: response to different wastewater matrices Photobioreactors; Nutrient Removal; Waste Water BACKGROUND: Immobilized algae are a promising tool to treat wastewater within a short time (<12 h) and simplify biomass harvesting compared with suspended algae. The potential of alginate-entrapped Chlorella vulgaris to bioremediate secondary (with and without nutrient supplementation), primary and two lagoon municipal wastewaters was investigated. The capability of the system to adapt to these wastewaters was analysed by determining biotic and abiotic nutrient removal, and further evaluated by comparison with suspended cells. RESULTS: The algal nitrogen (N) content (4.6â€“7.8 wt%) was closely related to the wastewater ammonium concentration (R2 = 0.97). The algal cells did not adapt N uptake as effectively to wastewater nitrate concentration because both abiotic N and phosphorus (P) removal increased. The algal P content (1.2â€“3.2 wt%) varied in response to the wastewater P and was inversely related to the initial cellular P content. The algae thus adapted nutrient uptake to the wastewater N:P level and ratio when ammonium predominated. Biomass production (35â€“73 mg L-1 d-1) increased with dissolved organic and inorganic carbon with little impact from other wastewater characteristics. Immobilization did not affect N and P uptake per cell compared with suspended algae. CONCLUSION: Decoupling biotic and abiotic removal showed adaptation to the N:P of the wastewater and luxury P uptake had significant impact during treatment of different wastewater matrices, these traits were not affected by immobilization. Immobilization enables increased N and P removal rates compared with suspended algal systems as nutrient uptake per cell is not affected and higher concentrations of algal biomass within the reactor are facilitated.

"Sustainable practices and their antecedents in the apparel industry: A review Fast Fashion; Textile Waste; Clothing Adopting sustainable practices has been a key focus for the resource- and labor-intensive apparel industry toward achieving sustainable development goals. Accordingly, apparel firms have innovated and implemented various sustainable practices. Several recent studies have investigated the feasibility of sustainable practices and their antecedents. However, comprehensive documentation of such practices and their antecedents is needed to further motivate and guide apparel firms in implementing sustainable practices. This study reviews and summarizes the most recent developments regarding sustainable practices and their antecedents in the apparel industry. Using the triple bottom line concept as a reference, the findings provide twenty-two practices that apparel firms can implement to enhance economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Moreover, the findings document fourteen antecedents of these sustainable practices. Finally, this study provides implications for the apparel industry and defines future research opportunities."
"Energy poverty and retirement income sources in Australia Energy Poverty; Family Characteristic; Thermal Comfort In many countries population ageing will increase the share of retirees in the coming years. Energy poverty is a particular problem for older people (due to fixed and often relatively low incomes and the need for additional energy due to underlying health conditions). This can have cost implications for the healthcare sector if the health of older people deteriorates due to energy poverty. The burden of population ageing and the increasing dependency ratio has meant the government is moving towards individuals funding their own retirement via compulsory superannuation schemes. Our study is based in Australia where there is a difference in retirement income sources between publicly funded Age Pensioners, Part-pensioners and Self-Funded Retirees leading to differences in energy poverty beyond income effects. Using 15 annual waves of the HILDA survey from 2005 to 2019, this study investigates drivers of energy poverty inequalities among retirees. Our main finding is that Age Pensioners are the worst off and Self-Funded Retirees the best off on a Low Incomeâ€“High Cost measure of energy poverty and on a subjective indicator of inability to heat the home. Therefore, not all retirees have the same probability of experiencing energy poverty. However, wealth, assets, social connections and good health are significant mediators that soften the impact of subjective concerns regarding energy bills for retirees. Government-funded pensions are a safety net and need to be sufficient in times of energy price inflation. Moreover, we need to reduce the gap between state-funded pensions and self-funding arrangements to ensure equity in elderly populations."
"Liquid-Metal-Enabled Mechanical-Energy-Induced CO2 Conversion Carbon Dioxide; Electrocatalysts; Chemical Reduction A green carbon capture and conversion technology offering scalability and economic viability for mitigating CO2 emissions is reported. The technology uses suspensions of gallium liquid metal to reduce CO2 into carbonaceous solid products and O2 at near room temperature. The nonpolar nature of the liquid gallium interface allows the solid products to instantaneously exfoliate, hence keeping active sites accessible. The solid co-contributor of silverâ€“gallium rods ensures a cyclic sustainable process. The overall process relies on mechanical energy as the input, which drives nano-dimensional triboelectrochemical reactions. When a gallium/silver fluoride mix at 7:1 mass ratio is employed to create the reaction material, 92% efficiency is obtained at a remarkably low input energy of 230 kWh (excluding the energy used for dissolving CO2) for the capture and conversion of a tonne of CO2. This green technology presents an economical solution for CO2 emissions."
"Incorporating perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA) into a geochemical index for improved delineation of legacy landfill impacts on groundwater Landfill Leachates; Leaching; Municipal Solid Waste Historical, or â€˜legacyâ€™ landfills are commonly unlined and can therefore pose risks to human health and the environment via the discharge of leachate to sensitive groundwater and surface waters. Characterising the impacts on groundwater from legacy landfills located within urban re-development precincts is therefore of growing importance worldwide and is difficult using conventional indicators. At Australia's largest urban re-development precinct, Fishermans Bend, seven known legacy landfills exist, as well as numerous other contamination sources (e.g. historical industrial spillages). Conventional landfill leachate indicators (e.g. ammonia-N and bicarbonate) and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA) were measured in 36 bores to distinguish leachate-impacted groundwater from non-impacted areas. Whilst eleven bores showed clear leachate impacts based on conventional indicators, others did not show clearly identifiable leachate signals, particularly those installed near landfills thought to have accepted a larger component of non-putrescible waste (e.g. industrial, construction and/or demolition waste). A new index for detection of legacy landfill leachate impact on groundwater was therefore developed, incorporating perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) as a proportion of PFAA (PFOA/âˆ‘PFAA) into an existing method based on leachate to native cation ratios, (â€˜L/N ratiosâ€™). Significant differences between the means of the leachate-impacted versus non-impacted bores were found using the â€˜modified L/N ratioâ€™ (p = .006), whereas no significant differences were found between the means of the two groups using the standard L/N ratio (p = .063). The modified L/N ratios also showed a statistically significant difference between the means of the bores impacted by municipal waste versus those impacted by non-putrescible waste (p = .003), indicating they are a much more sensitive indicator of both the existence and type of landfill leachate impact on groundwater than previously reported. This new index may prove particularly useful in complex urban areas where multiple potential contamination sources exist, and land use histories are either unknown or complicated. Capsule: Conventional methods for leachate detection in groundwater surrounding legacy landfills have been analysed and further developed via the inclusion of perfluoroalkyl acids, to better understand contaminant sources, fate and transport."
"Paving roads with recycled plastics: Microplastic pollution or eco-friendly solution? Asphalt Mixtures; Asphalt; Bitumens Although plastic-modified roads are a promising approach to reducing the amount of landfilled and incinerated plastic and improving asphalt pavement performance, the contribution of plastic-modified roads to microplastic pollution is unknown. This study aimed to develop a new abrasion procedure to quantify the release of microplastics from recycled plastic-modified asphalt depending on environmental factors, the type and content of plastic used, and the incorporation method in bitumen/asphalt. A Wet Track Abrasion machine was used to simulate road traffic abrasion on a plastic-modified asphalt sample, and a novel microplastic extraction procedure was designed to extract the generated microplastics. Incorporating recycled plastic as a polymer modifier in the bitumen matrix resulted in an early release of microplastics compared to its addition as a synthetic aggregate substitute in the asphalt mix. Cold temperatures and low pH values favoured the generation of microplastics from plastic-modified asphalt. Due to the lack of universal thresholds for the release of microplastics into the environment, environmental agencies and local authorities could benefit from this novel laboratory-based microplastic assessment procedure to foster the sustainable use of recycled plastic in roads."
"A VIKOR-based approach to evaluate river contamination risks caused by wastewater treatment plant discharges PPCP; Micropollutant; Drugs Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) rarely eliminate emerging contaminants from effluents they discharged into waterways, and therefore, represent significant contaminations sources with deleterious environmental risks. This paper presents a VIKOR-based model to assess the contamination risk posed by a cluster of WWTPs. A risk index was defined via building a membership function embodying the performance degrees of WWTPs and risks levels within the framework of fuzzy set theory. The proposed approach was tested using a case study of WWTPs cluster along the Pearl River. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate the robustness of the model. The results confirmed the ability of the proposed approach to reveal the risk level of a given treatment point. Further, the comparison with a TOPSIS scheme as well as sensitivity analysis results substantiate the consistency, accuracy, and reliability of the proposed approach. It is therefore bounds to improve the decentralized management of WWTPs-induced river contamination."
"Institutional betrayal and sexual harassment in STEM institutions: evidence from science and technology universities of Ethiopia Sexual Harassment; Workplace; Sexism In this paper, we examine the experiences of female students and academics to understand the factors that underpin the persistence of sexual harassment in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) institutions. We draw on data from interviews and focus group discussions with female students and academics who participated in a study that focuses on gender inequality in science and technology universities in Ethiopia. Drawing on the concept of institutional betrayal, we argue that the high prevalence of sexual harassment in these universities is perpetuated by institutional actions and inactions through which universities fail to proactively prevent and effectively respond to sexual harassment. We suggest efforts to tackle sexual harassment need to focus on proactive and preventive measures that involve revisiting institutional policies and structures. We further suggest that grievance procedures need to be accessible, responsive, trustworthy and supportive."
"The evaluation of the Australian office market forecast accuracy Office Markets; Certification; Commercial Real Estate Purpose: Property market models have the overriding aim of predicting reasonable estimates of key dependent variables (demand, supply, rent, yield, vacancy and net absorption rate). These can be based on independent drivers of core property and economic activities. Accurate predictions can only be conducted when ample quantitative data are available with fewer uncertainties. However, a broad-fronted social, technical and ecological evolution can throw up sudden, unexpected shocks that result in the econometric outputs sceptical to unknown risk factors. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate Australian office market forecast accuracy and to determine whether the forecasts capture extreme downside risk events. Design/methodology/approach: This study follows a quantitative research approach, using secondary data analysis to test the accuracy of economistsâ€™ forecasts. The forecast accuracy evaluation encompasses the measurement of economic and property forecasts under the following phases: testing for the forecast accuracy; analysing outliers of forecast errors; and testing of causal relationships. Forecast accuracy measurement incorporates scale independent metrics that include Theilâ€™s U values (U1 and U2) and mean absolute scaled error. Inter-quartile range rule is used for the outlier analysis. To find the causal relationships among variables, the time series regression methodology is utilised, including multiple regression analysis and Granger causality developed under the vector auto regression (VAR). Findings: The credibility of economic and property forecasts was questionable around the period of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC); a significant man-made Black Swan event. The forecast accuracy measurement highlighted rental movement and net absorption forecast errors as the critical inaccurate predictions. These key property variables are explained by historic information and independent economic variables. However, these do not explain the changes when error time series of the variables were concerned. According to VAR estimates, all property variables have a significant causality derived from the lagged values of Australian S&P/ASX 200 (ASX) forecast errors. Therefore, lagged ASX forecast errors could be used as a warning signal to adjust property forecasts. Research limitations/implications: Secondary data were obtained from the premier Australian property markets: Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth. A limited ten-year timeframe (2001-2011) was used in the ex-post analysis for the comparison of economic and property variables. Forecasts ceased from 2011, due to the discontinuity of the Australian Financial Review quarterly survey of economists; the main source of economic forecast data. Practical implications: The research strongly recommended naÃ¯ve forecasts for the property variables, as an input determinant in each office market forecast equation. Further, lagged forecast errors in the ASX could be used as a warning signal for the successive property forecast errors. Hence, data adjustments can be made to ensure the accuracy of the Australian office market forecasts. Originality/value: The paper highlights the critical inaccuracy of the Australian office market forecasts around the GFC. In an environment of increasing incidence of unknown events, these types of risk events should not be dismissed as statistical outliers in real estate modelling. As a proactive strategy to improve office market forecasts, lagged ASX forecast errors could be used as a warning signal. This causality was mirrored in rental movements and total vacancy forecast errors. The close interdependency between rents and vacancy rates in the forecasting process and the volatility in rental cash flows reflects on direct property investment and subsequently on the ASX, is therefore justified."
"Global mortality from firearms, 1990-2016 Gun Violence; Firearms; Licensed Dealers IMPORTANCE Understanding global variation in firearm mortality rates could guide prevention policies and interventions. OBJECTIVE To estimate mortality due to firearm injury deaths from 1990 to 2016 in 195 countries and territories. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study used deidentified aggregated data including 13 812 location-years of vital registration data to generate estimates of levels and rates of death by age-sex-year-location. The proportion of suicides in which a firearm was the lethal means was combined with an estimate of per capita gun ownership in a revised proxy measure used to evaluate the relationship between availability or access to firearms and firearm injury deaths. EXPOSURES Firearm ownership and access. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cause-specific deaths by age, sex, location, and year. RESULTS Worldwide, it was estimated that 251 000 (95%uncertainty interval [UI], 195 000-276 000) people died from firearm injuries in 2016, with 6 countries (Brazil, United States, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Guatemala) accounting for 50.5%(95%UI, 42.2%-54.8%) of those deaths. In 1990, there were an estimated 209 000 (95%UI, 172 000 to 235 000) deaths from firearm injuries. Globally, the majority of firearm injury deaths in 2016 were homicides (64.0% [95%UI, 54.2%-68.0%]; absolute value, 161 000 deaths [95%UI, 107 000-182 000]); additionally, 27%were firearm suicide deaths (67 500 [95%UI, 55 400-84 100]) and 9% were unintentional firearm deaths (23 000 [95%UI, 18 200-24 800]). From 1990 to 2016, there was no significant decrease in the estimated global age-standardized firearm homicide rate (-0.2%[95%UI, -0.8%to 0.2%]). Firearm suicide rates decreased globally at an annualized rate of 1.6%(95%UI, 1.1-2.0), but in 124 of 195 countries and territories included in this study, these levels were either constant or significant increases were estimated. There was an annualized decrease of 0.9% (95%UI, 0.5%-1.3%) in the global rate of age-standardized firearm deaths from 1990 to 2016. Aggregate firearm injury deaths in 2016 were highest among persons aged 20 to 24 years (for men, an estimated 34 700 deaths [95%UI, 24 900-39 700] and for women, an estimated 3580 deaths [95%UI, 2810-4210]). Estimates of the number of firearms by country were associated with higher rates of firearm suicide (P <.001; R2 = 0.21) and homicide (P <.001; R2 = 0.35). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study estimated between 195 000 and 276 000 firearm injury deaths globally in 2016, the majority of which were firearm homicides. Despite an overall decrease in rates of firearm injury death since 1990, there was variation among countries and across demographic subgroups."
"A parsimonious approach to mapping climate-change-related composite disaster risk at the local scale in coastal Bangladesh Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Climate; Resilience Climate-change-induced disaster risks impede sustainable development goals in many developing countries. With the prevailing climate change conditions, environmental events are likely to become even more pervasive. Coastal regions, the source of numerous tangible and intangible benefits for human populations, are exposed to a wide range of risks. With the motivation that knowledge of risk at local levels could bring substantial benefits for risk reduction planning, the current study devised a framework for mapping composite disaster risk at the local scale using context-specific risk variables and tested it within a clearly defined coastal sub-district of southwestern Bangladesh. Utilizing easily accessible spatial and non-spatial secondary datasets, a risk map for the study area was formulated using geospatial techniques. The map revealed that within a small area of about 230 km2, the disaster risk varied considerably, which is attributable to the variability of geographic and socio-demographic features of the area. The map delineated 21% of the study area as very high risk, 20% as high, 21% as moderate, 20% as low, and 18% as very low risk. The technique for risk mapping adopted in this study is inexpensive to conduct, doable within a brief period, requires limited data inputs and is thus useable for countries like Bangladesh that have a dearth of data. The resulting map is an improvement over existing risk maps, which are currently available only at the regional scale, and hence provides a robust platform upon which to commence the process of disaster risk reduction in the area."
"Waste diminution in Construction projects: Environmental Predicaments Construction Waste; Demolition; Waste Management Waste diminution in construction projects is not only a behavioural issue, but also an energy consumption and reduction concern. With construction waste equating to the significant amount of exhausted energy together with increased pollution, this contributes to a series of environmental predicaments. The overall goal of construction solid Waste Management is to collect, treat and dispose of solid wastes generated by project activities in an environmentally and socially satisfactory manner, using the most economical means available. As cities expand, their construction activities and consumption patterns further drive up the solid waste quantities. Governments are usually authorized to have responsibility for providing solid Waste Management services, and various administrative laws give them exclusive ownership over the waste produced. In addition, construction waste processing can be further controlled and minimized according to specialized authorities such as Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA) and their relevant acts and regulations. Moreover, a Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) can further control the treatment of waste and therefore, reduce the amount produced. Key elements of a CEMP not only include complying with relevant legislation, standards and guidance from the EPA; however, also to ensuring that there are systems in place to resolve any potential problems associated with site activities. Accordingly, as a part of energy consumption and lessening strategies, this paper will discuss various effective waste reduction methods for construction projects. Finally, this paper will also examine tactics to further improve energy efficiency through innovative construction Waste Management strategies (including desirability rating of most favourable options) to promote the lessening of overall CO2production."
"Designing for Transformative Futures: Creative Practice, Social Change and Climate Emergency Human-Computer Interaction (HCI); Interaction Design; Fiction We discuss three cases of transformative creative practice that aim to address large-scale societal issues related to the climate emergency by taking a series of interconnected, small-scale actions. Drawing on our first-hand perspectives, we reflect on how the cases address such issues by proliferating across different social contexts and supporting creative engagements of diverse stakeholders. We offer this empirical reflection at a time of rapid social and ecological change that has affected all life on the planet. Eco-social challenges and structural inequalities caused by shifts in global economic, political and technological power require new approaches and transformative actions to stabilize and restore ecosystems on which life depends. Our research shows that creative practice in art and design has a critical role to play in these processes of transformation. By discussing the opportunities and challenges encountered by our three cases within their transformative efforts and analyzing how they proliferate across diverse scales, we aim to expand the emerging scholarship on the transformative potential of creative practice."
"Hierarchical Distributed Coordination for Economic Dispatch Economic Dispatch; Microgrid; Parallel Algorithms The classical economic dispatch problem faces difficult challenges in a future smart grid with a great many distributed generators and fast power fluctuations due to high percentage of renewable energy. The traditional centralized scheme can not cope with a large number of generators, and the convergence rate of the purely distributed control decreases with the increase of the network size. A hierarchical distributed scheme based on a partition framework is proposed, in which the centralized local optimizations in regions and the distributed optimization among regions are coupled to solve the economic dispatch problem. Thus the number of agents in distributed part is greatly reduced by the partition. The simulation illustrate the effectiveness and good performance of the proposed protocol."
"Exploration of roadway factors and habitat quality using InVEST Road Kills; Collision; Wildlife Roadways vary in structural, geotechnical, locational, and operational properties, and synergies among these factors may present overwhelming challenges to understanding their full effects on the habitat quality (HQ). To explore the impact of dense roadway networks on an ecologically fragile region in the northwest of China, this study applied the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) to evaluate the HQ spatiotemporal distribution of the study area. Then, Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) were formulated to examine the cumulative impact due to the operation of an increasing amount of roadways over the past two decades. According to the results, the influence of different road types on the HQ was apparent within the road-effect zone, and road grading reduction, road length and operation duration increase can harm the HQ within the road-effect zone. Overall, this study generates knowledge concerning the design and operation of environmentally-friendly roadways in ecologically fragile areas."
"Microfinance and child mortality Credit; Microcredit; Financial Inclusion Microfinance institutions (MFIs) offer targeted opportunities for the poor to generate additional income with a range of financial services including credit, insurance, savings accounts and money transfers. Aside from reducing poverty, microfinance can potentially improve health because it is the poor who are usually more constrained from health investments due to limited budgets. Furthermore, microfinancing specifically targets women, who are more likely to spend additional income on childrenâ€™s well-being. Finally, several MFIs have also begun to offer health-related services, such as health education, health-care financing, clinical care, training community health workers, health micro-insurance and linkages to public and private health providers. Using a new data set, this article conducts the first multi-country study of the effect of microfinance on child mortality, the health outcome, which is most sensitive to the effects of absolute deprivation. Our findings confirm that an increase in the proportion of MFI clients in a country is significantly associated with lower under-five and infant mortality rates. We conclude that if MFIsâ€™ educational and health services have indeed caused improvements in health outcomes at the community level, then it may be important for governments to complement these activities with similar campaigns, particularly in remote areas where MFI penetration is low."
"Effects of COVID-19 on rail passengers’ crowding perceptions Passengers; Crowding; Pricing Understanding changes in travel behavior during the spread of pandemic diseases such as COVID-19 is important to develop a resilient transportation system. Since one of the most important ways to prevent the spread of this virus is to keep a safe distance from other people (i.e. social distancing), it has implications for the operations of public transportation as compared to other modes of transportation due to the confinement of a large number of passengers in enclosed space. This study investigated the effect of the spread of COVID-19 on crowding perception and crowding disutility in metro rail system of Tehran. Two surveys were conducted before and during the COVID-19. The stated preference data were analyzed by mixed logit models with the lognormal distribution. Results revealed that the value of crowding increased during the pandemic. Tracking the changes of crowding perception caused by COVID-19 shows that low comfort scores were observed at crowding levels where seats were taken, and the density of standees was high (i.e. not possible to maintain social distancing). During the outbreak of COVID-19, crowding has more disutility for rail passengers and the value of having a seat while traveling increased. Understanding passengersâ€™ perceptions of crowding as examined in this study will assist transport operators, and planners maintain the critical functionality of public transport systems and manage risks of mass transportation during the pandemic and beyond."
"Artificial intelligence: way forward to empower metal additive manufacturing product development – an overview Microstructure; Titanium Alloy (TiAl6V4); Inconel (Trademark) Metal additive manufacturing (MAM) has emerged as a promising technology to fabricate parts that are nearly impossible to do so by traditional methods. Since MAM is considered an open-loop system, it is not as efficient at fabricating repeatable and high-quality parts as a closed system. Hence, changing the MAM open-loop system to a closed system proves to be an imperative step for producing reliable parts. The direct application of physics or heat transfer or fluid dynamics equations to a MAM system is impossible as several uncontrolled parameters impact each layer fabrication. Thus, leading researchers are focusing on developing a digital twin, a real-time virtual model or digital representation to provide better control of the MAM process. Currently, the digital twin for MAM is in the development stage as the data capture through real-time monitoring, experimental values, and simulations from layer fabrication need to be sorted and stored in a structured manner. The way forward for a consistent quality MAM part is achieved through a digital twin which is explicitly driven by subsets of artificial intelligence such as machine learning and deep learning. More data must be further acquired and utilized to train the machine to learn the algorithm. An overview of artificial intelligence in additive manufacturing for a closed-loop system is presented."
"Developing Industry-Relevant Higher Order Thinking Skills in Computing Students Programmers; Hardware; Novice A 2016 survey commissioned by the British Higher Education Council revealed CS graduates had one of the highest unemployment rates. Industry sources attribute this to a growing gap between employer expectations and university curriculum. This gap primarily consists of soft skills and higher-order thinking skills, which include the ability to analyse, synthesise, evaluate, critique and design. Technical job advertisements increasingly specify higher order thinking skills as entry requirements for graduates. This paper presents the results of our work studying whether formative tasks can develop higher-order thinking skills. The formative tasks consisted of quizzes covering the first four levels of the Bloom's taxonomy. The higher-order thinking skills were measured based on the static and dynamic models students created for a real world problem, as part of the final exam. Our results reveal a strong correlation exists between application and analysis level quizzes and design activities needing higher-order thinking in the exam. Students repeating the quizzes several times also had better results than others in higher-order design skills. These results suggest that practising with well-constructed quizzes especially at the higher Bloom's level exercises the cognitive channels that help improve higher-order thinking skills."
"Non-Stoichiometry Induced Switching Behavior of Ferroelectric Photovoltaic Effect in BaTiO3 Ceramics Photovoltaic Effects; Solar Energy Conversion; Perovskites Ferroelectric photovoltaic (FPV) effect has been studied among a series of non-stoichiometric BaTiO3 (Ba/Ti = 0.92â€“1.05) ceramic chips prepared by tape casting method. The FPV performance increases abruptly when the Ba/Ti molar ratio deviates from the stoichiometry within 1%. Meanwhile, a photocurrent direction switching behavior is observed between Ti-excess and Ba-excess samples. The TEM analysis shows their significant difference in grain-boundary (GB), where abnormal GB with a width of 10â€“15 nm is observed in Ba-excess sample. The photocurrent switching phenomenon is described to the competition between the asymmetrical Schottky barriers induced PV effect and intrinsic FPV effect. Widen GB in Ba-excess BaTiO3 ceramics restrains the intrinsic FPV effect and results in the switching behavior. This study offers direct evidence of the vital role of GB in FPV effect and may promote the development of photovoltaic devices."
"Object-based random forest classification for informal settlements identification in the Middle East: Jeddah a case study Remote Sensing Image; Image Analysis; Land Cover The identification of informal settlements in urban areas is an important step in developing and implementing pro-poor urban policies. Understanding when, where and who lives inside informal settlements is critical in efforts to improve their resilience. This study aims to analyse the capability of machine-learning (ML) methods to map informal settlement areas in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, using very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery and terrain data. Fourteen indicators of settlement characteristics were derived and mapped using an object-based ML approach and VHR imagery. These indicators were categorized according to three different spatial levels: environ, settlement and object. The most useful indicators for prediction were found to be density and texture measures, (with random forest (RF) relative importance measures of over 25% and 23% respectively). The success of this approach was evaluated using a small, fully independent validation dataset. Informal areas were mapped with an overall accuracy of 91%. Object-based ML as a processing chain approach performed better (8%) than object-based image analysis alone due to its ability to encompass all available geospatial levels."
"Laser-Reduced Graphene: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications Graphene Oxide; Nanofiltration Membranes; Graphite Laser reduction of graphene oxide has attracted significant interest in recent years, because it offers a highly flexible, rapid, and chemical-free graphene fabrication route that can directly write on almost any solid substrate with down to sub-micrometer feature size. Laser-reduced graphene (LRG) is explored for various important applications such as supercapacitors, sensors, field effect transistors, holograms, solar cells, flat lenses, bolometers, thermal sound sources, cancer treatment, water purification, lithium-ion batteries, and electrothermal heaters. This contribution reviews most recent research progress on the aspects of fabrication, properties, and applications of LRG. Particular attention is paid to the mechanism of LRG formation, which is still debatable. The three main theories, including the photochemical process, the photothermal process, and a combination of both processes, are discussed. Strategies for tuning the properties and performance of LRG, such as the laser parameters, chemical doping, structure modulation, and environment control, are highlighted. LRGs with better performance including smaller feature size, higher conductivity, and more flexible morphology design in both 2D and 3D formats will offer tremendous opportunities for advancement in electronics, photonic, and optoelectronic applications."
"Finding influential nodes in social networks based on neighborhood correlation coefficient Betweenness; Spreaders; Complex Network Finding the most influential nodes in social networks has significant applications. A number of methods have been recently proposed to estimate influentiality of nodes based on their structural location in the network. It has been shown that the number of neighbors shared by a node and its neighbors accounts for determining its influence. In this paper, an improved cluster rank approach is presented that takes into account common hierarchy of nodes and their neighborhood set. A number of experiments are conducted on synthetic and real networks to reveal effectiveness of the proposed ranking approach. We also consider ground-truth influence ranking based on Susceptibleâ€“Infectedâ€“Recovered model, on which performance of the proposed ranking algorithm is verified. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms."
"‘Devastating, like it broke me’: Responding to image-based sexual abuse in Aotearoa New Zealand Retaliation; Sexting; Erotica The non-consensual taking or sharing of intimate images, also known as â€˜image-based sexual abuseâ€™, has become a widespread problem. While there has been growing attention to this phenomenon, little empirical research has investigated victim-survivor experiences. Drawing on interviews with 25 victim-survivors, this article focusses on the different responses to image-based sexual abuse in Aotearoa New Zealand. We found that victim-survivors had diverse and often multiple experiences of image-based sexual abuse, perpetrated for a variety of reasons, which extended beyond the paradigm of malicious ex-partners seeking revenge. Some participants described the harms experienced as â€˜devastatingâ€™: a form of â€˜social ruptureâ€™. Few had formally reported to police or pursued other justice options. While participants held different justice ideals, all sought recognition of the harms perpetrated against them. Yet they faced multiple obstacles when navigating justice, redress and support options. The authors conclude that far-reaching change is needed to improve legislative, policy and prevention responses to image-based sexual abuse."
"Life cycle assessment of rainwater harvesting system components – To determine environmentally sustainable design Rainwater; Harvesting; Water Saving There is a common perception that rainwater harvesting (RWH) is an environmentally sustainable water supply option. This perception is not always precise for all arrangements of the RWH system and components. Thus, all potential features of RWH need to be thoroughly studied to verify its environmental impacts. Broadly, on a household-scale RWH, there are two LCA aspects available in the literature, which can be identified as selecting tank material on the one hand and saving potable water on the other hand. Most of these studies used HDPE as tank material and its fabrication, transportation, installation, and disposal. However, the effects of yearly runoff and pollutant load reductions in net environmental impact assessments were not included in those studies. In this study, catchment-scale net environmental impacts of RWH systems made of different tank materials (e.g. HDPE, LDPE, ferrocement, and steel), components (with pump, no pump, and raised tank bases), tank and roof sizes, and varying annual rainfall patterns (e.g. dry, average and wet years) for various RWH supply reliabilities, were quantified through LCA approach. Results show that the HDPE tank has lesser impacts in most of the impact categories than other tanks. RWH systems with tank sizes of 2000 and 3000 L without pumps, and tank size of 2000 L with a pump under 150 m2 roof, are the most feasible environmental perspectives. The water-saving and pollutant load reductions cannot compensate for the pump operation's impacts, except for very few cases, like 2000 L tank during the driest rain year at lower reliabilities. A tank size larger than 2000 L would not be effective. On average, 70% of the total net life cycle impacts were developed from the operational phase of the RWH (with a pump). The pumping operation provided about 6.5 times higher CO2-eq emission than the water-main. The outlined strategy would help select tank materials, sizes, and RWH accessories based on annual rainfall and roof size available and introduce definite engineering standards, government rebates, and guidelines for RWH. This approach of quantifying the environmental impacts will explain further insights into the RWH system and its components."
"China’s preschool teacher workforce development 2010–2020: crossing the river by feeling the stones Early Childhood Education and Care; Nursery Schools; Preschool Education Accepting that building a substantial preschool workforce can accelerate a nationâ€™s transition to a knowledge society, Chinaâ€™s policy makers in 2010 announced that the size, qualifications and remuneration of the preschool teacher workforce would increase significantly by 2020. A body of literature has reported that the implementation of this policy has realised significant results. We adapt Marxist transition theory to ask how this success was realised and explain the sequence of steps taken to realise these advances. Data were collected following three timeframes based on national and local policy agenda. The participants included 24 preschool directors in 2012, 42 public servants in charge of local preschool management in 2016, and 7 public servants and 146 directors in 2019. We identify four steps in policy implementation and argue that the progress realised is largely due to the care with which the government has engaged its policy implementation strategy. This strategy has entailed identifying an overarching goal, undertaking a sequence of steps informed by experimentation, facts on the ground, listening to stakeholders and the resolute surmounting of interests that would restrain the reform process."
"Sustainable development and environmental restoration in Lake Erhai, China China; Dewatering; Confined Aquifer Eutrophication of lakes is an environmental issue that has attracted increasing attention all over the world. This study analyses the monitoring data of the Lake Erhai, Yunnan Province in China with Carlson's TSI, Improving Carlson's TSI (TSIM) and TLI. The results reveal that the eutrophication index for this lake is in the Mesotrophic status. The mechanism of the eutrophication in Lake Erhai is also investigated. The mechanism shows that rate of nutrient transformation is the core issue and the process of eutrophic evolution involves natural, social, and economic factors. The restrictions on sustainable development in Lake Erhai are discussed. To maintain sustainable development, green watershed construction (GWC) and its corresponding effective measures are proposed. Moreover, lessons learned from Lake Erhai watershed management are presented, to provide valuable experiences for alleviating water pollution caused by insufficient environmental management during rapid economic development. Perspective future research works are proposed, including establishment of the early warning system with remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) as well as the artificial intelligence (AI) technology."
"Productivity benefits of employer-sponsored training: A study of the Australia transport and logistics industry Apprenticeship Training; Firm; Human Capital Theory Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of employer-sponsored workforce training on employee productivity in the Australian transport and logistics industry. It challenges the quantitative notion of the ratio of inputâ€“output per labour hour as the single most important measure of productivity. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilised a mixed-method approach, involving online and on-site survey questionnaires and on-site semi-structured interviews of employers, employees and students within the industry. Survey questionnaires were administered to Vocational Education and Training (VET) learners to determine the dimensions of productivity gains, while qualitative interviews were conducted specifically to capture employersâ€™ perceptions and expectations of the benefits of training. Findings: Results show that the relationship between employer-sponsored training and workforce productivity is multi-dimensional where, ideally, all essential dimensions must be fulfilled to effectively achieve sustainable productivity level. One dimension is the quantitative measure of increased performance as an outcome of enhanced knowledge, skills and competencies. Another relates to the increased self-confidence, job satisfaction and pride. The third dimension is the cost savings that come with increasing employeesâ€™ overall awareness and appreciation of occupational health and safety. The results show that, aside from the dominant theories on training and labour productivity, the perception of the benefits of training on workplace productivity is not merely limited to the conventional understanding of productivity as a simplistic relationship between resource inputs and tangible outputs. Practical implications: Firms should consider redefining the benefits of training to include employee well-being and individual contribution to common team and organisational goals. Organisations therefore should broaden the notion of productivity to incorporate intangible benefits. Originality/value: The use of multi-method approach to investigate the views and perceptions of employees, employers and trainers about the productivity benefits of training and key concerns and challenges for the industry."
"The “Gender Agenda” in Agriculture for Development and Its (Lack of) Alignment With Feminist Scholarship Farmers; Women in Agriculture; Farm Families Sustainable food systems require sustainable agriculture. To achieve this, we argue, inclusive approaches are required that incorporate the voices and lived experiences of diverse social groups. In agriculture-based international development efforts (known as Agriculture for Development or A4D), it is increasingly being recognized that sustainable agriculture requires attention to gendered power relations. In the past, gender inequality has been a major barrier to developing inclusive, sustainable food systems, and continues to be so today. At the same time, however, gender is increasingly â€œon the agendaâ€ in A4D. Yet what sort of agenda is being promoted and to what extent does it reflect progress in feminist scholarship? We examine the burgeoning â€œgender agendaâ€ through the lens of policy materials produced by prominent A4D organizations. In doing so, we find problematic narratives that instrumentalise women in the name of sustainable agricultural development. However, we also find other more transformative discourses that, in troubling the drivers of gender inequality and promoting shared responsibility for change, reflect a deeper awareness of feminist scholarship. In any effort to advance sustainable agriculture, further progress is needed to address the myriad ways gender pervades not just development settings but development institutions and donor nations, and contributes to the production of as well as responses to global A4D challenges."
"Chlorination disadvantages and alternative routes for biofouling control in reverse osmosis desalination Osmosis Membranes; Reverse Osmosis; Desalination With an ever-increasing human population, access to clean water for human use is a growing concern across the world. Seawater desalination to produce usable water is essential to meet future clean water demand. Desalination processes, such as reverse osmosis and multi-stage flash have been implemented worldwide. Reverse osmosis is the most effective technology, which uses a semipermeable membrane to produce clean water under an applied pressure. However, membrane biofouling is the main issue faced by such plants, which requires continuous cleaning or regular replacement of the membranes. Chlorination is the most commonly used disinfection process to pretreat the water to reduce biofouling. Although chlorination is widely used, it has several disadvantages, such as formation of disinfection by-products and being ineffective against some types of microbes. This review aims to discuss the adverse effect of chlorination on reverse osmosis membranes and to identify other possible alternatives of chlorination to reduce biofouling of the membranes. Reverse osmosis membrane degradation and mitigation of chlorines effects, along with newly emerging disinfection technologies, are discussed, providing insight to both academic institutions and industries for the design of improved reverse osmosis systems."
"Trends and values of ‘Land for Wildlife’ programs for private land conservation Citizen Scientists; Monitoring; Volunteers The Land for Wildlife program started in Victoria in 1981 as a voluntary program with the broad aim of supporting landholders in providing habitat for wildlife on their property. The program has since spread across Australia and is implemented in a range of guises, through a variety of governance approaches. This research collected qualitative and quantitative data on Land for Wildlife programs across Australia to conduct the first national review. Data were gathered on changes in program membership to assess different participation trends. In addition, phone interviews with Land for Wildlife coordinators throughout Australia were conducted to explore how the programs are positioned in delivering biodiversity outcomes in a range of different regions. Over 14,000 properties covering 2.3 million ha are currently registered under Land for Wildlife programs. with at least 500,000 ha of habitat managed for conservation. Limited resources present a large challenge faced by a number of programs, with generally low funding and staffing resulting in restricted biodiversity focus and conservation outcomes. We suggest options to enhance the programs and propose future research directions."
"The science and politics of climate risk assessment in Australia's Murray Darling Basin Water Markets; Irrigation; Price of Water Climate change has many disruptive consequences, particularly in large river basins experiencing drying trends and declining water availability. With pressure for more adaptive policies, understanding how institutions governing water are adapting to climate risks has broad international relevance. This paper examines the challenges of climate risk assessments in Australia's Murray Darling Basin, an economically and culturally important basin where national legislation mandates a Basin Plan based on the best available science. However, despite repeated scientific warnings about a drying climate, the current Basin Plan does not reduce estimates of water resources available, and its climate risk management relies on a bricolage of policy mechanisms, which appear insufficient for the magnitude of predicted changes. This paper outlines the findings of original research exploring why this occurred. It draws on interviews with 30 senior public policy professionals and researchers with deep experience in climate and water policy. The interview data indicate that minimising political risks were the principal reasons for abandoning proposed reductions in entitlements and for relying on historical averages for estimating water availability. As the reform process evolved, decisions about water-planning techniques became increasingly politicised, and the adoption of explicit climate adaptation measures became problematic. As a result, the Basin Plan neither reflects the broad scientific consensus about climate change nor makes specific allowances for declining water availability. Climate risks are downplayed while concerns about levels of scientific uncertainties appear overstated. Importantly, lessons emerge from this examination that could contribute to the revisions of the Plan, scheduled for 2026. More generally, the research finds that proactive climate adaptation policies for large river basins require sustained and well-designed institutional reforms, particularly the adoption of legally prescribed procedures for utilising science - and accounting for its use - in controversial environmental reforms."
"Spatial-Temporal Patterns of Air Pollutant Emissions From Landing and Take-Off Cycles in the Yangtze River Delta of China During the COVID-19 Outbreak Environmental Pollution; Medical Waste; COVID-19 The global aviation industry has been experiencing catastrophic disruption since the beginning of 2020 due to the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air traffic. Although the decline in regular commercial air travel has caused tremendous economic loss to aviation stakeholders, it has also led to the reduction in the amount of recorded air pollutants. Most of the aircraft emissions are released during the cruise phase of flight, however they have relatively small impact on humans due to the fact that those emissions are released directly into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Therefore, the scope of this study is to investigate the ground-level aircraft emissions from landing and take-off (LTO) cycles, as they have a greater influence on the ambient environment of the airports in a specific region. In this paper, we study the variation of typical air pollutant concentrations (i.e., HC, CO, and NOx) from the LTO cycles during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in both temporal and spatial scales. These ground-level emissions are estimated for the 22 airports in the Yangtze River Delta, China. The results indicate that the variation pattern of the three air pollutants were significantly influenced by the dramatic onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the pertinent policies to suppress the spread of the virus. The results also reveal non-uniform distribution of the emission quantified at different airports. It is noticeable that the emission quantity generally declined from the east coast to the central and western part of the research region. Furthermore, discrepancies in the target markets also create disparities in the variation pattern of the emissions at different airports under the context of COVID-19."
"Study protocol for the Healthier Wealthier Families (HWF) pilot randomised controlled trial: Testing the feasibility of delivering financial counselling to families with young children who are identified as experiencing financial hardship by community-based nurses Mental Health Care; Primary Care; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Introduction Poverty and deprivation can harm children's future health, learning, economic productivity and societal participation. The Australian Healthier Wealthier Families project seeks to reduce the childhood inequities caused by poverty and deprivation by creating a systematic referral pathway between two free, community-based services: Universal, well-child nursing services, which provide health and development support to families with children from birth to school entry, and financial counselling. By adapting the successful Scottish 'Healthier Wealthier Children' model, the objectives of this Australian pilot are to test the (1) feasibility of systematising the referral pathway, and (2) short-term impacts on household finances, caregiver health, parenting efficacy and financial service use. Methods and analysis This pilot randomised controlled trial will run in three sites across two Australian states (Victoria and New South Wales), recruiting a total of 180 participants. Nurses identify eligible caregivers with a 6-item, study-designed screening survey for financial hardship. Caregivers who report one or more risk factors and consent are randomised. The intervention is financial counselling. The comparator is usual care plus information from a government money advice website. Feasibility will be evaluated using the number/proportion of caregivers who complete screening, consent and research measures, and access financial counselling. Though powered to assess feasibility, impacts will be measured 6 months post-enrolment with qualitative interviews and questionnaires about caregiver-reported income, loans and costs (adapted from national surveys, for example, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey); health (General Health Questionnaire 1, EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale short-form); efficacy (from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children); and financial service use (study-designed) compared between arms. Ethics and dissemination Ethics committees of the Royal Children's Hospital (HREC/57372/RCHM-2019) and South West Sydney Local Health District (2019/ETH13455) have approved the study. Participants and stakeholders will receive results through regular communication channels comprising meetings, presentations and publications."
"Transformation of biosolids to biochar: A case study Biochar; Soil; Black Carbon This case study examines the feasibility of the production of biochar from biosolids using energy neutral pyrolysis process using ASPEN Plus process modeling followed by a detailed techno-economic assessment. The modeling exercise demonstrated that the pyrolysis can be energy neutral with moisture content in biosolids as high as 50 wt.%. In the case of moisture content lower than 50%, surplus energy will be available which can be converted to electrical energy; generating additional revenue. Further analysis on the effect of pyrolysis temperature on surplus energy available revealed that surplus energy increased when pyrolysis temperature reached from 450 to 650Â°C, but it gradually decreased above 650Â°C. The techno-economics analysis suggested that biosolids management cost and biochar sale price were the most critical sensitivity factors while capital and operating costs of the pyrolysis unit seemed to be less critical. The positive Net Present Value values in scenario modeling suggest that the conversion of biosolids to biochar using energy neutral pyrolysis process looks promising and is techno-economically feasible for most of the studied scenarios.

"A review of the current in-situ fouling control strategies in MBR: Biological versus physicochemical Wastewater Treatment; Anaerobic Digesters; Fouling Fouling in membrane bioreactors (MBR) is a bottleneck problem limiting their application. In-situ fouling control strategies have been continuously developed for decades, and can be mainly categorized as biological and physicochemical approaches. However, the mechanisms and performance of these methods as well as their application prospects have not been thoroughly discussed and compared in a systematic manner. This study was aimed at providing a detailed review on the various in-situ biological and physicochemical methods in terms of fouling control performance, fouling reduction mechanisms and practicability. This involves a comparison of the popular biological control strategies including quorum quenching (QQ)) and physicochemical approaches such as NaClO backflushing, hybrid electrochemical MBR and anti-biofouling membrane development, with the analysis of their potential, existing issues and practicality in full-scale applications. Future work is also recommended for developing more sustainable and more widely applicable MBR fouling control strategies."
"Chemical Dopant Engineering in Hole Transport Layers for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells: Insight into the Interfacial Recombination Perovskite Solar Cells; Solar Cell; Formamidine Chemical doping of organic semiconductors has been recognized as an effective way to enhance the electrical conductivity. In perovskite solar cells (PSCs), various types of dopants have been developed for organic hole transport materials (HTMs); however, the knowledge of the basic requirements for being efficient dopants as well as the comprehensive roles of the dopants in PSCs has not been clearly revealed. Here, three copper-based complexes with controlled redox activities are applied as dopants in PSCs, and it is found that the oxidative reactivity of dopants presents substantial impacts on conductivity, charge dynamics, and solar cell performance. A significant improvement of open-circuit voltage (Voc) by more than 100 mV and an increase of power conversion efficiency from 13.2 to 19.3% have been achieved by tuning the doping level of the HTM. The observed large variation of Voc for three dopants reveals their different recombination kinetics at the perovskite/HTM interfaces and suggests a model of an interfacial recombination mechanism. We also suggest that the dopants in HTMs can also affect the charge recombination kinetics as well as the solar cell performance. Based on these findings, a strategy is proposed to physically passivate the electron-hole recombination by inserting an ultrathin Al2O3 insulating layer between the perovskite and the HTM. This strategy contributes a significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency and environmental stability, indicating that dopant engineering is one crucial way to further improve the performance of PSCs."
"Emerging women leaders’ views on political participation in Melanesia Political Representation; Quotas; Parliament Existing explanations for why women do not get elected to parliament in Melanesia emphasize structural barriers to participation, including prohibitive costs and patriarchal norms. They are largely silent, however, on why those women who do conform to the profile of the â€œarchetypal candidate,â€ and thus have the best chance of overcoming these barriers, choose not to run. Drawing on an extensive qualitative dataset, including forty in-depth interviews with emerging women leaders from three Melanesian countries, we find that many women are pessimistic about the way electoral politics are conducted. Echoing longstanding critiques of political practice, this cohort conceptualizes their political activity as being conducted in a parallel public sphere, in contexts in which they consider themselves more able to pursue programmatic reform. Rather than focusing on structural barriers, we explore their decision to eschew parliamentary elections as an act of resistance against politics as usual in Melanesia. This new material adds to the literature on why women chose to run â€œfromâ€ rather than â€œforâ€ parliament and therefore has implications for scholars and practitioners interested in improving womenâ€™s parliamentary representation across the globe."
"Robust output feedback control for aeroelastic vibration suppression of a 2-DOF airfoil under quasi-steady flow Flutter; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Unsteady Aerodynamics In this paper, a robust output feedback control design is developed for suppression of aeroelastic vibration of a 2-DOF nonlinear wing section system. The aeroelastic system operates in a quasi-steady aerodynamic incompressible flowfield and is actuated using a combination of a leading-edge (LE) and a trailing-edge (TE) flap. By only utilizing measurements of pitching and plunging deflections, an innovative Lyapunov-based procedure is used to design sliding mode control inputs for the LE and TE control surface deflections. The closed-loop system is shown to have semi-global asymptotic stability even in the presence of model uncertainty and unknown external gust loading. Extensive simulation results under a variety of scenarios show the effectiveness of the control strategy."
"Governing urban greening at a metropolitan scale: an analysis of the Living Melbourne strategy Urban Biodiversity; Urbanization; Birds As Australian cities face challenges of increased size, density and a range of environmental issues, compounded by climate change impacts, integration of greening is receiving increased attention. Greening, in the form of parks, gardens, waterways, water-sensitive designs and green roofs, contributes to liveability, sustainability and resilience, and habitat for non-human species. Local governments are responsible for the day-to-day management of much of Australiaâ€™s urban public spaces and are developing strategies for these areas. However, local-scale planning risks piecemeal, uncoordinated and ineffective approaches, particularly for biophysical systems that have little relationship with municipal boundaries. How can a metropolitan-scale approach be applied to green space planning and governance? This paper presents a case study of Living Melbourne metropolitan urban forest strategy, developed by Nature Conservancy and Resilient Melbourne. Resilient Melbourne brings together Melbourneâ€™s 32 local governments to plan and advocate at the metropolitan scale. While the Living Melbourne strategy provides a metropolitan-scale approach, questions of governance, including how the strategy will be implemented and how local context is understood, are highlighted. Further, in developing a metropolitan-scale approach, how are the voices of local communities included? The paper analyses who is governing Melbourneâ€™s urban greening, and the benefits and risks of a metropolitan-scale approach."

"Phosphorylation of the VAR2CSA extracellular region is associated with enhanced adhesive properties to the placental receptor CSA Malaria; Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1; Plasmodium Falciparum Plasmodium falciparum is the main cause of disease and death from malaria. P. falciparum virulence resides in the ability of infected erythrocytes (IEs) to sequester in various tissues through the interaction between members of the polymorphic P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) adhesin family to various host receptors. Here, we investigated the effect of phosphorylation of variant surface antigen 2-CSA (VAR2CSA), a member of the PfEMP1 family associated to placental sequestration, on its capacity to adhere to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) present on the placental syncytium. We showed that phosphatase treatment of IEs impairs cytoadhesion to CSA. MS analysis of recombinant VAR2CSA phosphosites prior to and after phosphatase treatment, as well as of native VAR2CSA expressed on IEs, identified critical phosphoresidues associated with CSA binding. Site-directed mutagenesis on recombinant VAR2CSA of 3 phosphoresidues localised within the CSA-binding region confirmed in vitro their functional importance. Furthermore, using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9), we generated a parasite line in which the phosphoresidue T934 is changed to alanine and showed that this mutation strongly impairs IEs cytoadhesion to CSA. Taken together, these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of the extracellular region of VAR2CSA plays a major role in IEs cytoadhesion to CSA and provide new molecular insights for strategies aiming to reduce the morbidity and mortality of PM."
"Novel Privacy Preserving Non-Invasive Sensing-Based Diagnoses of Pneumonia Disease Leveraging Deep Network Model Image Encryption; Cryptography; Hyperchaotic System This article presents non-invasive sensing-based diagnoses of pneumonia disease, exploiting a deep learning model to make the technique non-invasive coupled with security preservation. Sensing and securing healthcare and medical images such as X-rays that can be used to diagnose viral diseases such as pneumonia is a challenging task for researchers. In the past few years, patientsâ€™ medical records have been shared using various wireless technologies. The wireless transmitted data are prone to attacks, resulting in the misuse of patientsâ€™ medical records. Therefore, it is important to secure medical data, which are in the form of images. The proposed work is divided into two sections: in the first section, primary data in the form of images are encrypted using the proposed technique based on chaos and convolution neural network. Furthermore, multiple chaotic maps are incorporated to create a random number generator, and the generated random sequence is used for pixel permutation and substitution. In the second part of the proposed work, a new technique for pneumonia diagnosis using deep learning, in which X-ray images are used as a dataset, is proposed. Several physiological features such as cough, fever, chest pain, flu, low energy, sweating, shaking, chills, shortness of breath, fatigue, loss of appetite, and headache and statistical features such as entropy, correlation, contrast dissimilarity, etc., are extracted from the X-ray images for the pneumonia diagnosis. Moreover, machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and naive Bayes are also implemented for the proposed model and compared with the proposed CNN-based model. Furthermore, to improve the CNN-based proposed model, transfer learning and fine tuning are also incorporated. It is found that CNN performs better than other machine learning algorithms as the accuracy of the proposed work when using naive Bayes and CNN is 89% and 97%, respectively, which is also greater than the average accuracy of the existing schemes, which is 90%. Further, K-fold analysis and voting techniques are also incorporated to improve the accuracy of the proposed model. Different metrics such as entropy, correlation, contrast, and energy are used to gauge the performance of the proposed encryption technology, while precision, recall, F1 score, and support are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed machine learning-based model for pneumonia diagnosis. The entropy and correlation of the proposed work are 7.999 and 0.0001, respectively, which reflects that the proposed encryption algorithm offers a higher security of the digital data. Moreover, a detailed comparison with the existing work is also made and reveals that both the proposed models work better than the existing work."
