0,"ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions (CEED). Administered by The University of Queensland The vision of The ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions (CEED) is to be the world's leading research centre for solving environmental management problems, and for
evaluating the outcomes of environmental actions. This research will benefit environmental science and management in Australia and internationally. Individually our key researchers are recognised as global leaders in applied environmental science - CEED will draw together this
expertise to produce a centre of international scale and calibre that will tackle the complex problem of environmental management and monitoring in a rapidly changing, risky and uncertain world. While the goal of being the world leader in a research field seems loftyour track record of publications in the world's top journals, and the fact that the disciplines of
ecology and environmental management are one of Australia's strongest research areas, make this an ambitious but feasible goal.","SDG 3, SDG 9, SDG 12, SDG 15, SDG 16, SDG 17","health-related millennium development goals, communicable disease prevention and control, health supply chain management, sustainable disease control, global health targets","construction management, supply chain management, adaptive co-management, life cycle thinking, life cycle design","sustainable management, material recovery facilities, solid waste management, life cycle, sustainable practices","forest management planning, sustainable forest management, forest management, land management, land productivity trends","conflict management, environmental management systems, national goals and targets, environmental management, resource management","sustainable development objectives, whos millennium development goals, united nations millennium development goals, the millennium development goals, fifth millennium development goal",,,,,,,,,,,
1,"Biofabricating complex synthetic skin structures (PhD candidate: Emily Liu s3862245) Skin is the largest organ of the human body, and is responsible for several functions vital to human survival, such as barrier protection, homeostatic modulation, and sensory function. Understanding skin’s response to external stimuli (including disease, and topically applied drugs and chemicals) is a perennial question across clinical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields. Historically animal models have been used for most of this testing, but this usage has declined in recent years owing to ethical concerns and the introduction of ‘3R’ (Replace, Reduce, Refine) legislation across most of the globe in the early 2000s. In vitro skin models have emerged as a more sustainable, humane and human-relevant alternative to animal testing. Whilst there are number of commercially available synthetic skin models, these models have not obtained the complex anatomical and physiological features (such as layering and vasculature) found in native human skin. If more complex synthetic skin could be created in the lab, it would have a breadth of applications including disease modelling, as well as testing for the toxicity and corrosivity of chemicals, transdermal drug delivery and cosmetic product testing.","SDG 3, SDG 16","tuberculin skin test, international classification of diseases, health systems research, cross-boundary cancer studies, long-lasting insecticidal nets",,,,"area of protection, health sector reforms programme (hsrp), health research systems, fisheries regulation, health sector reforms",,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"Eco-Bio sanitary pads to end period poverty The project aims to develop low-cost, eco-friendly, bio-based sanitary pads, for effective management of women menstrual health and hygiene (MHH), in low and middle income countries (LMIC). Such sanitary pad will not only be effective and medically safe, but also disposable & fully compostable. The absorbent core of commercially available effective but expensive sanitary pads (Figure 1) is primarily made of petrochemical-based superabsorbent gels for increased liquid absorption and retention; where the barrier layer is made of non-biodegradable plastics for fluid impermeability, and the adhesive layer is formed using silicone-based glues. Besides cost, the risks
associated with synthetic superabsorbent materials include pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cancer and toxic shock syndrome, and the high carbon footprint barrier; and the adhesive layer materials cause potential health and environmental threats.","SDG 2, SDG 3, SDG 5, SDG 8, SDG 15, SDG 17","health-related millennium development goals, perinatal mental health project, maternal, newborn, and child health, health information systems project, maternal, newborn and child health",,,"soil security dimensions, agriculture and food security, crop protection, artemisia annua agrotechnology, plant genetic resourse",,"millennium development goalspovertyeducationequitywomen, millennium development goals (mdg) maternal mortality, sustainable development goal indicators, millennium development goals attainment, millennium development goal (mdg) 4","food security indicators, food security and nutrition, food and nutrition security, poverty goals, child nutrition disorders/epildemiology/economics","womens dietary diversity score, reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, womens health issues, womens and childrens health, saving mothers and newborns initiative","child health surveys, growth standards, money metric poverty, non-health gross domestic product loss, quality of working life",,,,,,,,
3,"Meat Industry Efficiency and Innovation Capacity Enhancement; Benchmarking Technologies and systems from Automotive Industry This project will focus on accelerating the adoption of new technologies by benchmarking the competitive, and sustainable Automotive manufacturing industry. The Automotive industry, as a high volume- low margin sector, is the pioneer in automating manual tasks, by developing the most advanced and cost-effective systems.
Development of innovative manufacturing, processing, materials handling solutions and technologies as well as management systems and appropriate culture has helped the automotive industry to stay efficient and sustainable for many years. On the other hand the Australian automotive industry is leaving a huge number of culturally trained and skilled workers behind.
All the above mentioned makes the need for an extensive research in adapting and using the already existing technologies, strategies and systems in the Automotive industry inevitable. A PhD research project for the duration of 3 years to study the possibilities and potentials for the red meat industry to adapt technologies and solutions in the field of automation, materials handling solutions, management of processes and procedures, and quality assurance systems developed and used by the Automotive industry is proposed.
The research outcomes will generate a database for a rapid knowledge transfer in order to improve red meat industry's innovation capacity on a sustained basis. This will ensure quick knowledge transfer by enabling the industry to acquire skills, as well as a huge number of skilled and culturally trained, unemployed workforce. This database will generate a bank for several future research activities in line with the AMPC capability building strategic plans.","SDG 3, SDG 8, SDG 12, SDG 17","health-related millennium development goals, health systems challenges, health service needs, health information systems project, health services accessibility",,"material recovery facilities, material efficiency, material recovery, material footprint, material stock",,,"fifth millennium development goal, millenium development goal, urban sustainable development goal, sustainable development objectives, 2030 sustainable development goals",,,"growth standards, employability, working conditions, development work, growth status",,,,,,,,

40,"Harnessing the power of the gut-brain axis; dietary manipulations as a therapy in a model of preterm infant brain injury The data from this project is envisaged to support our hypothesis that after an early life inflammatory challenge that recapitulates preterm infant brain damage, ongoing microbiome disturbances alter gastrointestinal structure and function alongside changes in brain structure and function. We also hypothesise that treatment of preterm born infants with the polysaccharide fucoidan will potentially improve the associated nervous system damage. Fucoidan is a complex polysaccharide found in many species of brown seaweed. Fucoidan has previously been shown in pre-clinical studies to restore the microbiome and decrease systemic inflammation when provided as a dietary supplement [1]. Fucoidan is safe to use in humans, being shown to decrease circulating levels of pro-inflammatory marker interleukin-6 and to decrease monocyte phagocytosis [2]. Fucoidan is detected in the blood of humans following ingestion [3]. The industry partner Marinova will provide Fucoidan (i.e. food grade standard seaweed extract) for this project. 

We will employ a well validated animal model of the inflammatory injury of the preterm born infant [4, 5].  In this model we will show the effects of perinatal injury on the gut microbiome, and myelin integrity using a novel, transportable non-invasive and translatable approach; subsurface Raman spectroscopy for investigating the biochemistry of brain tissue in situ, such as a signature for myelin integrity.  We will validate our novel Raman data with conventional immunohistological approaches.  In this model using these translatable techniques we will also test the neuro- and enteroprotective ability of dietary fucoidan. Gastrointestinal tissues will also be banked from animals in this project for future analysis following positive outcomes from this study.","SDG 3, SDG 5, SDG 11","health systems challenges, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, health needs assessment, health care surveys",,,,,,,"womens dietary diversity score, maternal & newborn health road maps, severe maternal outcome, gender indicators, reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health",,,,,"road traffic injuries, road traffic injury, road accidents, climate policy analysis models, environmental degradation",,,,

The project will run for 12 months and include animal studies. Part of the animal studies will be subcontracted to Scolexia (to be finalised and contracted) Ridley applied for a voucher under the DEDJTR Boost your Business Program Food Innovation Vouchers stream with assistance from RMIT. RMIT provided a quote for a work specification which has been accepted. (see attached letter) Under the voucher program, the industry partner is able to obtain funding support from the state govt of 50% of project value up to a maximum of 50k. Given the project value of 80613, that means the company is funding 40307 and the government 40306. The mechanism used for these projects is to bill the company up front for their contribution. At the end of the project, the parties complete a voucher and send certain supporting material to the government and RMIT then bills the government for the balance.

64,"Cost reduction and Deployment of Prefabricated Building Integrated Photovoltaics By 2050, world energy consumption is expected to increase more than 55%. Buildings remain a sector where efficiency improvement is critical to achieving the commitments of the Paris Agreement. Current approaches for the reduction of energy consumption in buildings are often predicated on the integration of bespoke renewable technologies into building projects. Among various renewable energy sources, solar energy is an attractive option in many countries with access to abundant solar resources.
Worldwide growth of photovoltaics has been fitting an exponential curve for more than two decades. Technology development, commercialization, and manufacturing scaling have contributed significantly to rapid reductions in solar hardware costs. However, the 'soft costs' of going solar including design, energy storage, financing, procurement, permitting, installation, labour, and inspection, have not declined as rapidly. The 'soft costs' make up more than half of the total cost of solar systems in buildings. The lack of economic confidence in the building sector makes the integration of prefabricated solar panels to building envelop difficult. 
This research aims to evaluate the mechanisms driving the cost reductions and deployment of prefabricated Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV). We will delve deeply into specific past technological innovations and policies, and prospectively asses BIPV's potential for future cost reduction.","SDG 3, SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 14, SDG 16, SDG 17","quality improvement and health systems strengthening, health-related millennium development goals, health services accessibility, non-governmental organizations health systems strengthening, quality improvement","low-cost energy technology, sustainable innovation, infrastructure reconstruction, energy industry, sustainable infrastructure",,,"sustainability policy, sustainability governance, health sector reforms, organisation for economic co-operation and development, quality regulation","sustainable development objectives, urban sustainable development goal, sustainable development goals, sustainable development goal, sustainable development goal",,,"growth standards, green and inclusive economic growth, organizational capacity building, sustainable economic development, organizational capacity development",,,,,,,"marine pollution abatement and ambient water quality improvement, irrigation efficiency, fish species, marine biodiversity conservation, river blindness","energy efficiency, energy efficiency, energy renovation, energy accessibility, sustainable energy investments"

66,"Antibacterial Packaging Solutions Globally, 32% of the food produced in the world for human consumption becomes waste (FAO, 2011). Food waste refers to food that is discarded that is still edible. Reducing food losses/waste would greatly contribute to abating worldwide sustainability challenges such as food security, natural resources shortages and climate change. Japan's food mileage index in 2001 was 900 billion ton-kilometres that equates to more than three times that of the United States, which has more than twice Japan's population. Food mileage is calculated by multiplying the transportation distance with the volume of food transported. The higher the food mileage the larger the load placed on the global environment. This is particularly relevant for the import of fresh produce such as meats that require packaging to preserve and extend shelf-life. The principle factor for faster breakdown of food products is contamination of the product through exposure to microorganisms.

COVID-19 has led to economic chaos across the globe with effects on financial markets, businesses and millions of households. The aim of this project is to understand the complex relationships between economic insecurity and gambling behaviours. The linkages between the macroeconomic environment and personal economic insecurity impact on individual health and wellbeing and can act as a trigger for gambling behaviours.
This project will explore these connections using a unique longitudinal dataset collected over a single calendar year, 2021. The purpose of the study is to establish how, and the channels through which: i) economic insecurity in the global economy, and ii) personal economic positions, work as leading antecedents of gambling harm. We will explore actual and perceived economic positions. COVID-19 has created economic uncertainty for many people including those still in active employment or those who have not suffered immediate loss; understanding the role of perceived (as well as actual) insecurity in promoting gambling harm is very important.","SDG 2, SDG 3","health-related millennium development goals, global health targets, health services accessibility, health services evaluation, health systems challenges",,,,,,"food and nutrition security, food security indicators, food security and nutrition, solutions of food security, food insecurity",,,,,,,,,,

HIV persistence in the central nervous system (CNS) is thought to contribute to ~50% of people living with HIV (PLWH) developing a form of cognitive impairment and may be related to the poor penetrance of anti-HIV drugs into the CNS. Therefore, new therapies and/or treatment strategies are required to deliver anti-HIV drugs to the brain. In this project we will develop and validate a
novel drug delivery molecule that binds to and directly delivers anti-HIV drugs to HIV-infected cells in the brain. Targeted drug delivery to the brain may improve drug efficacy, reduce risk of drug toxicity and reduce the role of HIV in driving neurocognitive disorders, thus improving outcomes for PLWH.","SDG 3, SDG 10, SDG 16","malarial drug resistance, quality improvement and health systems strengthening, antiretroviral treatment, human immunodeficiency virus, antiretroviral therapy",,,,"safe delivery care policy, justice delivery system, health research systems, health sector reforms programme (hsrp), national development planning",,,,,"human development indicators, health outcome inequality, delivery of health care/organization and administration, immunization coverage disparities, income levels growth",,,,,,,

Achieving Excellence in STEM through Evidence-Based Pedagogies.                     (Administered by Southern Cross) This project aims to determine how young children's (4-5 years) learning of scientific concepts can be supported through nature play. The increase of children attending kindergarten/preschool continues to rise markedly with 33g,243 Australian children enrolled. Coupled with this increase, is also the rapid surge of nature play pedagogies in kindergartens. The effectiveness though of nature play is untested,
making this the first study in the world to explicitly research nature play in early childhood education. This is significant because nature play is a core feature and tradition of early childhood education practice and pedagogy. This project will forge new knowledge about nature play pedagogies and how they can support children's scientific learning in early childhood education. Such research supports both the OLD Department of Education STEM Strategy (2016) and the National STEM Education Strategy (2016-2026) where ""it recognises the importance of a focus on STEM in the early years"" (p.5).","SDG 3, SDG 4, SDG 5, SDG 17","maternal, newborn, and child health, quality improvement and health systems strengthening, early childhood core and development, maternal, newborn and child health, child education",,,,,"united nations decade of education for, millennium development goalspovertyeducationequitywomen, millennium development goals attainment, un decade of education for sustainable development, millennium development goals 4 and 5",,"reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, womens literacy programmes, womens and childrens health, girls education, maternal and child care",,,,"education and child health, family literacy, education planning, open education resources, quality education",,,,,
120,"A proton flow reactor system for large-scale electrical energy storage and bulk export of hydrogenated carbon based material In this project we are developing an integrated system for medium and grid-scale storage of renewable energy and exporting it as hydrogen within hydrogenated carbon-based media. A novel `proton flow reactor? system for producing hydrogenated carbon(C)-based powder for bulk export will be developed. The reactor employs electricity from renewables to charge a flowing `slurry electrode? of C-particles with hydrogen. Hydrogen, as protons, is obtained by water splitting. Solid hydrogenated C-powder for storage and transport is generated by removing the liquid. At the destination, this C-powder is reconverted into a slurry and passed through a similar reactor operating in `fuel-cell? mode to re-generate electricity. This system will be a scaled-up form of RMIT?s novel proton battery ? a reversible PEM fuel cell that reversibly stores protons in its solid electrode without forming hydrogen gas. The technical feasibility of a proton battery with an activated carbon electrode has recently been proven by the RMIT team. Importantly the system may open up an alternative market for Australian coal that has no adverse greenhouse gas impact. The efficiency and levelised cost of delivered energy will be assessed, and a roadmap for scale-up and commercialisation developed.","SDG 2, SDG 7, SDG 9, SDG 15",,"energy industry, low-cost energy technology, supply chain sustainability, construction materials, small- and medium-sized enterprises (smes)",,"environment, flex crops, net cereal production, endangered species, crop production",,,"food supply chain wastes, food chain, fruit, food-water-energy-climate change nexus, food-water-energy nexus",,,,,,,,,,"electrical energy storage (ees) technologies, energy infrastructure, renewable and sustainable energy, energy conversion, energy efficiency"

Concept for Vietnam and Beyond The proposed Proof of Concept (PoC) is of paramount importance given the case of recent voluntary disaster relief operations in the central provinces of Vietnam which were severely affected by several back-to-back floods in early October of 2020. During this operation, there have been various problems widely reported on social media which can be synthesised into (1) too many relief delegations in some affected areas, while too few in the others; (2) too many relief delegations arriving at an affected area at the same time; (3) too many relief necessities which have already been provided at an affected area, while there is a shortage at other areas; and (4) uneven distribution of relief necessities among different groups of affected people. It is envisaged that a lack of up-to-date information, unharmonised coordination among stakeholders involved in the relief operations, and the absence or weak capability in resources optimisation, all contributed to the aforesaid problems. This project, therefore, aims to address the aforesaid problems through the application of
information and computing sciences in disaster relief. Specifically, the PoC of a Cloud-based Disaster Relief Coordination and Optimisation Platform shall be designed and prototyped to (1) enhance the harmonised coordination among various stakeholders in disaster relief operations through centrally processed information and data, and (2) optimise the outcomes of such operations via computing algorithms.

The activity within the Pollution Detection program helps us to understand the temporal changes in condition and assess whether pollution mitigation measures implemented over the project are reducing the pollution load to Dandenong Creek.  Additionally it enables us to see if there are any emerging chemicals that need to be monitored in future. Furthermore, results from this survey inform us about priority chemicals within the Creek and from this we can identify sub-catchments for further investigation into pollution sourcing and subsequently pollution prevention.

Real case optimisation modelling can be roughly defined as the combination of a CONTEXT, related DATA, MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSES and NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION.  Here, we will focus on the three first components. The implementation and computational tests will be addressed later for specific identified problems.  Following this logic, the workshop is organised in three days: 
1. Ecological wager of fire and alternative practices including notably the impact of fires on emblematic species and the question of traditional Aboriginal fires 
2. Data science for ecological data that merges data mining, geospatial sciences and space technologies.
3. Ecological and ecosystem perspective in model-based bushfire management: a capstone on how to embed the conclusions of the two first days into mathematical optimisation models for fire land management.

The workshop is scheduled from 12 to 14 November 2018 in room 80.04.20 and 80.04.21.  It includes a public lecture (by Cristina Montiel Molina Professor of Regional Geography, University Complutensa of Madrid / Pau Costa Foundation,  Spain) during the evening of 12 November in  80.07.01 (topic to be announced). We expect 40 participants for the workshop and 80 for the public lecture.

As we know material and material composite discovery and formulation is a time consuming process. If human input can be minimised in the design of an experiment and analysis of its subsequent results, it is likely that optimised research outcomes can be reached faster and more efficiently. AI has traditionally been
used for single compound discoveries. What is absent is how porous materials and composites can be formed from the existing pool of knowledge and how we can teach it chemical intuition for developing new porous MOFs and composite material systems.
The Student will assist CSIRO with using AI and computerized mathematical simulations and theory such as Monte Carlo simulations to predict, model and develop new MOF and MOF-polymer composite materials for CO2 capture from air . With the aid of AI and simulations, this Project will attempt to use Machine Learning (ML) in workflows to produce MOF materials and MOF-polymer composites that are specifically tailored for engagement for a range of applications and the student will be involved in projects with real-world outcomes. This will include modelling systems and developing the AI to predict MOFs for capturing CO2 at various partial pressures and concentrations.

Designing for the benefit of the whole (Student: Stephanie Camarena) The future of humanity is urban with a predicted 66% of people living in cities by 2050. However, with the sprawl of cities, agricultural knowledge is lost and the disconnection from the source of food growing emphasises issues of waste, resilience, food security and health. Climate change is adversely impacting the production of food in Australia whether in terms of quantity, quality and altogether availability.

Providing alternative and sustainable food systems requires an increased connectivity between demand and supply, the valorisation of local products, stewardship and local knowhow. Better models and techniques could support a way for local consumption to more closely match the production available or the production capacity in urban and peri-urban areas.

The research will develop a model based on a series of case studies using artificial intelligence (AI) applied to different parts of the food system. The system design thinking methods will allow observations and findings on how redesigning part of the food system can
improve the benefits of the whole and how adopting a service system design from the start might change the problem formulation. The proposed model could help evaluate city food policies and future planning and bring a clearer understanding of how habits and purchases

192,"Decentralized thermal storage to stabilize the electrical distribution network. This research is proposed to investigate the use of domestic hot water heaters with both autonomous and
centralized control to act as thermal energy storage with the intention to stabilize an electrical distribution network.
An appealing nature of domestic hot water heaters is that the existing electrical distribution infrastructure has
capacity to supply the water heaters and the thermal loads can respond rapidly when centrally controlled. This
indicates a large energy storage capability with low network capital investment and rapid deployment possibilities.

This opportunity has arisen after the arrival at RMIT of Prof Paul Gorry and A/Prof Paul Ramsland. We will hold a workshop at CSIRO with Prof George Lovrecz to discuss how best we can use our expertise to form a cohesive group of researchers with the ability to tackle one of health¿s most intractable problems, the lack of an HIV vaccine. For example, one approach is a new type of vaccine, termed a nanocapsule. The Smooker/Walduck laboratory has expertise in this area. Paul Gorry has constructs that express HIV antigens in mammalian cells. Scale-up of mammalian expression is the expertise of CSIRO. A member of the team will be trained in such expression at CSIRO..

This work will facilitate the coalescence of a strong, complementary research team, and position us to apply for external funding for this and other projects.

persistence in the CNS and inform HIV cure strategies. To this end we have compiled one of the largest tissue
banks of matched CNS and non-CNS tissue from HIV-infected individuals in Australia (n=80). Tissue from CNS and
non-CNS regions will be assessed by immunohistochemistry/hybridisation methods for cells containing viral DNA

benefits over traditional qPCR based quantification methods as they provide information at a single cell level, thus
allowing for the specific cell types infected in the CNS to be assessed. Furthermore, they can be performed on
formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue.
Secondly, we will further characterise the potential replicative ability of HIV infected cells in the CNS by assessing
intact genomes as it has been reported that ~93% of proviruses in CD4+ T cell reservoirs, a major HIV reservoir in
the blood, are defective and contain large internal deletions/and or hypermutations at the HIV tat-rev splice junction

either vulnerable to the inevitable impacts of climate change, or are essential to ensure Victoria is prepared. This
includes net zero emissions for the whole economy by 2050, and adaptation action plans for key systems. Primary
Production has been identified as a key system and the Minister for Agriculture is the nominated lead Minister to delivery
this plan by October 31 2021. The Act requires AAPs to be developed every five years after that.
The delivery of the AAP is being overseen by the Executive Board (EB) of the Department of Jobs Precincts and
Regions (DJPR), with the Chief Adviser, Climate Change in Industry Transition (CCIT) responsible for bringing items to
the EB for consideration. The CCIT team is leading the delivery of the AAP in close collaboration with Agriculture
Victoria, Rural and Regional Victoria (Plantation Forestry), and Fisheries Victoria. A Steering Committee has been
established to ensure delivery of the AAP on time and has representation of each agency.
The purpose of this engagement is to provide the Steering Committee with access to necessary technical expertise to
develop an evidence-based AAP for primary production. Technical expertise will be sought at a daily rate to support the
Steering Committee, and to review and advise on components of the work. Expertise will also be sought on industry
transitions to support this parallel workstream in the CCIT team.

Paunch waste needs exhaustive pre-treatments before its thermochemical transformation to produce char and gas in a conventional pyrolyser or gasifier system. The processes proposed here completely eliminate this water removal step and generate value-added products such as hydro- or super- char (i.e. char produced from hydrothermal and supercritical conditions) and a high quality syngas enriched in hydrogen. The thermal and solids conversion
efficiencies with these advanced processes can be as high as 90-95%. The superior forms of char obtained can be functionalised for their applications in soil amendment, as adsorbent in waste water treatment or for advanced energy generation. If successful, it will resolve a number of ongoing and future socio-economic and environmental issues associated with waste disposal/treatment in Australian abattoirs.

215,"LDPE and Crumb Rubber in Asphalt Several types of materials are currently being recycled in roads. Among those, the most common are Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material - e.g. old asphalt roads - crumb rubber and, more recently, waste plastic. The latter has been already available in the market since decades in the form of low-crystallinity polyolefins and other thermoplastic polymers - Austroads also has one registered plastomeric-modified bitumen product named 'A35P' in its range of polymer-modified bitumen types. However it is only since recently that the need for recycling has pushed the use of recycled plastic in asphalt mixes. The use of high percentage of LDPE and HDPE in roads is commonly limited by several drawbacks such as increased temperature and reduce workability during construction operations; most importantly, plastic-modified asphalt has been largely acknowledge as to improve asphalt performance at high service temperature where high stiffness is needed but cannot provide any tangible benefit to increase the service life of the road due to poor fatigue characteristics - not being an 'elastic' elastomer limits the ability to rapidly and continuously recover from deformations due to loads (e.g. the traffic). The use of plastomeric-modified bitumen A35P is also discouraged by recent documents from Austroads and AAPA (Australian Asphalt Pavement Association) for fatigue purposes. On the other hand, crumb rubber modification of bitumen is ascribed to provide greater elasticity - even at low service temperature - hence shifting to more ductile behaviour and improved fatigue service life. High temperature issues are still to be considered though.","SDG 3, SDG 11","priority substances and priority hazardous substances (ps/phs), health needs assessment, health systems challenges, abuse substances, health service needs",,,,,,,,,,,,"road accidents, road traffic injuries, road traffic injury, road accident, road safety",,,,

218,"Regional Tasmania Walkability The Australian Urban Observatory (AUO) is a digital portal developed at RMIT University measuring and
mapping liveability across Australia’s 21 largest cities at Local Government Area (LGA) level and down to
suburbs and local neighbourhood.

Walkability for transport is calculated based on three key factors: land use mix and services of daily
living (something to walk to); street connectivity (a way to get there); and dwelling density (higher
population densities are associated with increased populations needed to supply services and different
land uses) (Giles-Corti et al., 2014). These factors influence how people move around their local
neighbourhoods to complete everyday activities and the importance of access to supermarkets,
convenience stores, petrol stations, newsagents and public transport stops in community design.
Extensive research literature has consistently shown that local neighbourhood design is an important
influence of physical activity, health outcomes, social connectedness and sustainability (Saelens et al.,
2003).

The AUO currently includes five separate walkability indicators: average distance to closest activity centre,
average dwelling density per hectare, average street connectivity per square kilometre, average number
of daily living destinations present (0-3) within 1600m, and walkability for transport index. An example of
suburb level differences of the average street connectivity per square kilometre is provided in Figure 1
overleaf.

Any progress made during this time is, however, at risk of being lost because of the COVID-19 crisis. During the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, research showed that in the creative industries women were more likely to be laid off or lose work. Studies have shown that in
times of crisis creative workers’ more risk-averse working patterns include retreating to trusted networks of collaborators which, while understandable, has gendered outcomes, as one of the most frequently cited reasons for women (and others) being disadvantaged in
these industries is the exclusionary nature of such networks.
This proposed research project is designed to provide a snapshot of the changes taking place as the industry adjusts to the crisis, and begins to make plans for rebuilding. The information gathered by the proposed project will be of vital importance if the industry is to
retain the focus on inclusivity that has emerged in recent years.

It does this through a study of conflict resolution, understood broadly (Ramsbotham et al 2011) in Mali and Bougainville (a region of Papua New Guinea), drawing on practice-informed theoretical insights from critical security and peace and conflict studies (e.g., Mac Ginty & Richmond 2016; Boege et al, 2009). These two cases are different in many respects. Both, however, are heterogeneous security contexts, characterised by complex interaction and interdependence among different forms of social and political order, and different providers of conflict resolution and security. State and traditional or
indigenous authorities are leading security and conflict resolution actors, but there are others that fit neatly into neither category. Both Mali and Bougainville are also on the UN Security Council agenda.
After being earlier touted as an example of a successful multi-ethnic state, Mali in the grip of a multilayered conflict without a clear way forward; Bougainville approaches a vote on independence from PNG against an earlier war of secession, followed by two decades of peacebuilding. Neither Mali nor Bougainville, at contrasting points in the `conflict cycle?, are fixed in conditions of violence or relative

Viruses rely on host cell signalling pathways for their replication. We will identify key host cell signalling proteins activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection and validate their potential as targets for curative drugs. This project will establish synergistic cooperation between two Victorian research institutions with complementary capabilities/expertise: RMIT University (kinomics of infectious systems) and Melbourne Health/Doherty Institute (SARS-CoV-2 cell and molecular biology).
Our innovative approach to prevent viral replication by inhibiting human signalling enzymes opens a new avenue in anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery, based on untapped targets that will offer low propensity for resistance. This strategy overcomes two major problems that impairs anti-infective drug development:
(i) Drug resistance. Targeting human enzymes deprives the virus of the fastest mechanism for drug resistance, namely the selection of mutated resistant targets.
(ii) Targeting host-cell kinases opens the well-funded cancer drug discovery pipeline to antiviral drug development. Inhibitors that are already approved for use in humans can be rapidly progressed to clinical trails and repurposed as a treatment for SARs-CoV-2 infection.","SDG 3, SDG 17","health systems challenges, malarial drug resistance, multi drug resistance, communicable disease prevention and control, infectious disease control",,,,,"mdg sanitation targets, global conservation targets, millenium development goal, millenium development goals, millenium development goals",,,,,,,,,,,

The odours originating from treatment plant is' nuisance to surrounding neighbourhood which requires to be controlled.
Currently different odour removal techniques are available out of which, chemical conditioning is the most cost-effective technique. The different chemical compounds used are mainly Iron salts, Bioxide, Oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide, Anthraquinone, lime, and NaHCO3. Among the different chemical compounds, lime is known as the most cost-effective chemical used for odour removal from

247,"Examining the biodiversity footprint of the City of Melbourne Organisations, governmental and nongovernmental, are the largest contributors to the ongoing 
environmental degradation globally, including biodiversity loss. Their large environmental footprints make 
them important leverage points to reduce or reverse global trends of biodiversity loss. In 2019, the City of 
Melbourne declared a climate and biodiversity emergency. As part of this declaration the City of 
Melbourne is committed to reducing their biodiversity footprint, but it is not always clear the best way to 
do so for an organisation as large as the City of Melbourne. The objective of this research is to identify 
solutions to reduce the City of Melbourne’s biodiversity footprint.

248,"Invertebrate Use of Rooftops in Melbourne Our proposed research will monitor biodiversity impacts of the construction of two new green roof retrofits in Melbourne CBD: the demonstration green roof on 1 Treasury Place and the Melbourne Skyfarm on Siddeley Carpark. These two rooftops represent unique case studies in green roof installation and design considering their spatial context (particularly proximity to large ground-level parks) and design objectives (primarily research and urban agriculture, respectively). We will measure invertebrate diversity, abundance and utilisation on each of these roof sites as well as bare roofs, green roofs and ground sites in the vicinity of each of these new developments, both before and after construction. This provides a unique opportunity to establish and utilise baseline data on roof use by animals to understand questions of habitat use, colonisation, and roof-roof interactions. Surveying the target roofs before the installation of the green infrastructure and collecting information about the species using surrounding roofs after installation will provide detailed information about the additional biodiversity benefits green roofs can deliver in highly urbanised environment. Thus, the findings of our study can be used to better integrate biodiversity and green infrastructure planning.","SDG 3, SDG 14, SDG 15","health systems research, quality improvement and health systems strengthening, health information systems project, community health worker programmes, infectious disease control",,,"protected area of key biodiversity areas, biodiversity conservation, 2010 biodiversity target, biodiversity research network, protected species",,,,,,,,,,,,"marine biodiversity conservation, fish species, marine biodiversity, conservation of marine biodiversity, marine pollution abatement and ambient water quality improvement",

317,"The Lurujarri Dreaming Trail In this course you will have the opportunity to learn about, listen to,discuss and engage with indigenous people about their knowledge andrelationship to land. You will spend 9 days with the Goolarbooloo people ofBroome W.A. walking the Lurujarri dreaming trail. Lurujarri, meaning coastaldunes, is the Aboriginal name that generally describes the stretch of countryfrom Broome, W.A. to Minarriny, about 90 kms to the north of Broome. The trailfollows part of a traditional Aboriginal song cycle that originated from theDreamtime. The background and significance of the trail is outlined by FransHoogland as follows:-    We have to learn to see again, learn to walk, to feel all these things again.This is why the Lurujarri trail is so important. The Lurujarri trail will getus to listen, to start walking slowly, and to teach people...people areintroduced to the song cycle through direct experience of walking, of beingwith it, trying to understand the living quality of the country. That have tobe experienced. Its very hard to grasp that out of reading books or throughpeople talking (Sinatra and Murphy Listen to the People : Listen to the Land1999, Melbourne University Press).    The course does not aim to provide you with an overview of Aboriginal cultureand knowledge about land and land management but rather it aims to introduceyou to a different way of knowing 'country' from the perspective of theGoolarbaloo people of Broome. Insights gained will assist you towards anappreciation of different ways of knowing land and an understanding of some ofthe issues involved in working collaboratively with Aboriginal people. AsMarcia Langton observes:-    Aboriginal and western systems of knowledge are parallel, co-existing, butdifferent, ways of knowing. Scientific descriptions of nature and precepts ofthe natural world cannot subsume traditional ways of knowledge. Collaborativeprojects are not merely annexing traditional systems of knowledge, but rather,interacting with them, and thus the outcomes are neither absolutely the resultof scientific thought nor that of Aboriginal thought. Rather each is a sourceof understanding the very difficult issues that are posed by the natural worldon this continent (Marcia Langton Burning Questions ; emerging environmentalissues for indigenous peoples in northern Australia 1998 Centre for IndigenousNatural and Cultural Resource Management, NT)","SDG 3, SDG 4, SDG 17","health-related millennium development goals, quality improvement and health systems strengthening, disability-adjusted life years, country health information systems, health services accessibility",,,,,"united nations decade of education for, united nations millennium development goals, history of millennium development goals, un decade of education for sustainable development, the millennium development goals",,,,,,"education for sustainable development, education for sustainability, teachers professional development, leadership education, quality education",,,,,
